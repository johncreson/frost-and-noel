**Date:** December 16 (Day 3 of 12)

---

## Chapter 1: Avoidance Dance
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,300

### Opening Hook
*"They were going to be professional about this. They were adults. Adults who had done adult things together—specifically kissing-related adult things—and were now pretending it hadn't happened. Very adult behavior."*

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Noel's apartment → Merryweather Hall, morning
- **Noel's state:** Didn't sleep. Can't stop touching his lips.

### Beats to Hit
1. Noel rehashing the kiss, obsessively
2. Convincing himself it was a mistake (unconvincingly)
3. Arriving at the Hall, ready to be Normal About This
4. Eben is there. Looking like that.
5. They make eye contact. Both immediately look away.

### Avoidance Tactics
- Noel throws himself into work
- Eben does the same in a different area
- They're both very aware of exactly where the other is
- *"Professional. Completely professional. The fact that Noel could feel Eben's presence across the room like a weather system was irrelevant."*

### Chapter Hook
Today is the bake-off. At Candle & Crumb. They have to go. Together.

---

## Chapter 2: Bake-off Brief
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Candle & Crumb Bakery, mid-morning setup
- **The event:** Community bake-off fundraiser

### Beats to Hit
1. Wes hosting = he sees everything
2. The bakery is warm, flour-dusted, smells incredible
3. Noel is in his element—charming contestants, organizing chaos
4. Eben watches. Catalogues. Tries not to stare.
5. They keep almost talking. Keep not talking.

### Wes As Observer
- Wes, quietly: "Interesting day yesterday?"
- Eben: "Standard."
- Wes: "Mmm." *Knowing look.*
- Eben hates that look.

### Internal Conflict
*"The kiss had been a mistake. Obviously. A momentary lapse in judgment caused by exhaustion and proximity and—and the way Noel smiled when he was genuinely surprised by something. That wasn't a reason. That was an excuse."*

### Chapter Hook
Hugh arrives. Nothing good ever follows this.

## Chapter 3: Flour Chaos
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,500

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Candle & Crumb, mid-bake-off
- **The disaster:** Hugh + flour = everybody covered

### The Incident
1. Hugh is "helping" with supplies
2. Something tips, something falls, chain reaction
3. FLOUR EXPLOSION
4. Everyone is white. Everything is white. Hugh is delighted.
5. Noel and Eben, standing next to each other, both covered

### Comic Beats
- A contestant's fondant sculpture collapses dramatically
- Someone starts crying (it's fine, the sculpture was ugly anyway)
- Hugh: "Well! That's one way to... um..."
- Wes, deadpan: "Everyone's fired."

### The Moment
- Noel, flour in his hair, looking at Eben
- Eben, flour on his face, looking back
- A beat. Then—
- *Noel laughs. Real, uncontrolled, undignified laughter.*
- Eben almost smiles. Almost.
- *"That laugh was going to be a problem. Eben could already tell."*

### Chapter Hook
In the chaos, Eben does something unexpectedly kind.

## Chapter 4: Quiet Kindness
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,300

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Back room of bakery, quieter moment
- **The reveal:** Noel sees the real Eben

### The Moment
1. A nervous first-time baker, overwhelmed
2. Their pie crust crumbled. They're spiraling.
3. Eben crouches beside them. Voice soft.
4. Talks them through fixing it. Patient. Kind.
5. Noel watches from the doorway. Short-circuits.

### Internal Meltdown
*"Great. Perfect. Emotionally unavailable glacier man was also secretly kind. Noel's type, apparently, was 'everything he thought he didn't want, served in one devastating package.'"*

### Eye Contact
- Eben looks up. Catches Noel watching.
- Holds the gaze for one beat too long
- Returns to helping the baker
- *Neither acknowledges what just passed between them*

### Wound Poke
- Internal: *"He's useful. He's kind. He's competent. But is he—does he—"*
- *"Stop. This doesn't matter. It was one kiss."*
- *"A really good kiss."*
- *"That didn't matter either."*

### Chapter Hook
The bake-off ends. They have to leave.

## Chapter 5: The Win
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Candle & Crumb, evening wrap-up
- **The victory:** Event succeeded despite everything

### Beats to Hit
1. Bake-off complete. Winners announced.
2. Noel and Eben, side by side, finally
3. "We did it." "We did."
4. The first genuine conversation since the kiss
5. Where does this go now?

### The Unspoken
- They should talk about it
- Neither brings it up
- But the air between them is different now
- *"Something was waiting. Something that had started in a tiny office and was now demanding attention."*

### Exit Together
- Wes: "Get home safe, you two."
- (The way he says "you two")
- They walk out into the cold together
- Snow falling. Streets quiet.

### Chapter Hook
This time, they're going to address it.

## Chapter 6: The Walk
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,300

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Tinsel Town streets, evening, snow falling
- **The build:** Walking home, loaded silence

### Beats to Hit
1. Walking through snow, shoulders almost brushing
2. Neither mentions the direction—they're heading the same way
3. The town is beautiful. Lights. Snow.
4. Noel can't think about any of it.

### The Conversation
- Noel: "So. Last night."
- Eben, carefully: "Yes."
- Noel: "We don't have to talk about it."
- Eben: "We probably should."
- Noel: "Probably."
- *Neither talks about it.*

### The Turn
- A quiet street. Alone.
- Noel stops walking.
- "I want to."
- Eben: "Want to what."
- Noel, meeting his eyes: "Whatever happens next. I want to."

### Chapter Hook
Eben's breath catches.

## Chapter 7: First Time
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~2,000

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Noel's office/apartment
- **THE SCENE:** First full sex scene

### The Approach
1. Getting inside. Door barely closed.
2. Kissing against the wall. More desperate than last night.
3. *"This was its own kind of confession. Hands saying what words couldn't."*

### Heat Structure
**Consent moments:**
- Eben: "Do you want this?"
- Noel: "Yes."
- Eben: "Tell me if you want me to stop."
- Noel: "Please don't stop."

**The escalation:**
1. Clothes loosened—imperfect, first-time energy
2. Hands on skin—both learning each other
3. Moving to the bed (or couch, or wherever)
4. "Look at me" moment at peak—eye contact maintained
5. Release with vulnerability

**Emotional Truth:**
- This isn't just physical
- *"Eben's hand on his jaw, tilting his face up. 'Look at me.' And Noel did. And it felt like being seen for the first time."*
- The intimacy is the real scene

### Aftercare
- Eben cleans them up. Careful.
- Drapes Noel's coat over his shoulders
- "Are you okay?"
- Noel, honest: "I don't know."

### Chapter Hook
They don't know what this is. But something has changed.

---

## Chapter 8: Afterglow
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,000

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Noel's place, late night/early morning
- **The aftermath:** Vulnerability and uncertainty

### Beats to Hit
1. They're not touching. Not quite.
2. The room is quiet. Too quiet for what just happened.
3. Neither knows what to say.

### The Truth
- Eben: "I should—"
- Noel: "Yeah." (But doesn't move away)
- A moment where neither moves.
- Internal: *"This was supposed to feel like a mistake. It didn't feel like a mistake. It felt like the start of something, which was worse."*

### The Exit
- Eben gets up. Gets dressed.
- Noel watches. Doesn't ask him to stay.
- A kiss at the door—brief, loaded
- "Tomorrow." "Tomorrow."

### Final Line
*"Eben walked home in the snow and didn't feel the cold. He was too busy feeling everything else."*
