## Chapter 1: Ice Rink Setup
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Opening Hook
*"Noel was fine. He was also on four hours of sleep, running on his third coffee, and pretty sure he'd forgotten to eat yesterday. But fine. Definitely fine."*

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Town ice rink, morning setup
- **The event:** Family skating day

### Beats to Hit
1. Ice rink prep—lights, hot cocoa station, music
2. Noel already overworking (as always)
3. Eben notices. Concerned face.
4. "You should rest." "After the event."
5. Tension from yesterday (the barn) hums underneath

### Wound Pattern
*"There was always something after the current thing. That was how Noel operated. Useful now, rest later. Later just never arrived."*

### The Dynamic
- They're together now. Real.
- But neither knows exactly what that means
- Noel defaults to work. Eben watches.

### Chapter Hook
Families start arriving. It's going to be a long day.

3. Eben watching from the side  
4. Hugh creating minor chaos somewhere
5. Wes observing everything, as always

### Community Warmth
*"This was why Noel did it. Moments like this. Kids skating for the first time, couples holding hands, the whole town moving together like one big organism."*

### Hidden Exhaustion
- Noel is running on empty
- Eben clocks it. Doesn't say anything yet.
- *"He would crash later. Eben could see it coming. The question was whether Noel would let himself be caught."*

Noel stumbles. Falls.

---

## Chapter 3: The Fall
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Ice rink
- **The injury:** Noel falls, hurts his wrist

### The Accident
1. Helping a kid, overbalances
2. Falls hard on the ice
3. Wrist twists—sharp pain
4. Kids watching: "Are you okay, mister?"
5. "Fine!" *Internal: I am not fine.*

### Eben's Response
*"Eben was there before Noel finished pretending he wasn't hurt. Just—there. Like he'd been waiting for this. Like he'd known it was coming."*

- Eben, voice calm: "Let me see."
- Noel: "It's nothing—"
- Eben's hand on his arm. Gentle but firm.
- "Let. Me. See."

### The Help
*"Noel let himself be helped. It felt strange. Unfamiliar. Like wearing someone else's clothes."*

### Chapter Hook
First aid. Private room. Caretaking.

## Chapter 4: The Care
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** First aid station, private
- **THE BEAT:** Eben takes care of Noel

### The Scene
1. Cleaning the abrasion. Wrapping the wrist.
2. Eben focused. Precise. Gentle.
3. *"He worked like Noel was something fragile. Something that mattered."*
4. Noel watching him with an expression Eben couldn't read

### The Bandage
*"Eben's hands were steady. They were always steady. That was the thing about Eben Frost—he held everything together. Other people's crises, festival logistics, his own emotions."*

*"Right now, he was holding Noel's wrist like it was the most important thing in the world."*

### Dialogue
- "You don't have to be fine."
- Noel, startled: "What?"
- "You don't have to be fine. Not with me."
- *Long pause.*
- Noel: "I don't know how to not be fine."

### Chapter Hook
Something shifts. They're closer now.

## Chapter 5: Quiet Space
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,300

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Private room, after first aid
- **The moment:** Noel confronts his fear of receiving care

### The Confrontation
*"The thing about being taken care of is that it requires admitting you need care. Noel would rather skate into traffic. He would rather—"*

*"Actually, no. He was tired of 'rather.' He was just tired."*

### Internal Work
- Why is receiving care so hard?
- The wound: useful = lovable
- If he needs care, is he still useful?
- *"What if 'useful' wasn't the price of admission?"*

### Eben's Presence
- Sitting with him. Not demanding anything.
- Just—there.
- *"That was new. Someone staying without needing him to do something first."*

### Chapter Hook
Cocoa. Garland Cup. Quiet time.

### The Build
- Noel: "Thank you. For today."
- Eben: "You don't have to thank me."
- Noel: "I know. I want to."
- *Pause.*
- Noel: "I... need—"

### The Unfinished Sentence
*"He stopped. The word caught. 'Need' was dangerous. 'Need' was admission. 'Need' was—"*

*"Eben waited. Didn't push. Just sat there with his hands wrapped around his own mug, patient as a saint."*

- Noel doesn't finish
- The sentence hangs there
- Both know it won't be finished tonight
- **But it will be. EP11.**

- *"That was its own confession."*
- They go inside together

### The Night
- First time actually sleeping together
