## Chapter 1: Cold Open
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Opening Hook
*"Noel Merrick had been awake for thirty-seven hours and was handling it fine. This was a lie, but it was a festive lie, so it counted."*

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Merryweather Hall, 5:47 AM, still dark outside
- **Noel's state:** Coffee-fueled, running on spite, surrounded by disaster
- **The problem:** Three vendors cancelled. Sound system is "temperamental." Someone double-booked the main tent. A goose is loose somewhere.

### Beats to Hit
1. Establish Noel's competence through action (fixing things, directing people, solving problems with a smile)
2. Show his exhaustion through physical tells (hand tremor, eyes burning, jaw tight)
3. Internal: *"Just twelve more days. Eleven after today. He could sleep in January."*
4. Mayor Kringle appears, mentions "the help I arranged" — Noel is confused
5. Before he can ask, another crisis pulls him away

### Wound Setup
- Someone says "What would we do without you?"
- Noel's internal: *"That was the question, wasn't it. What would anyone do without him. What would he be, if he wasn't useful?"*

### Chapter Hook
The main door opens. Someone new is here.

## Chapter 2: First Meeting
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Merryweather Hall entrance, morning
- **Eben's arrival:** Clipboard, coat, controlled assessment

### Beats to Hit
1. Eben observes the chaos, immediately catalogues problems
2. First impression of Noel: *"He smiled like someone who had learned it from a book and practiced until it stopped looking terrifying. It almost worked."*
3. Mayor Kringle intercepts Eben, explains the assignment
4. Eben understands: "babysitter" for someone who doesn't know he's coming
5. He watches Noel handle three crises in ninety seconds. Reassesses.

### First Contact
- Noel finally notices him, crosses the room
- "Can I help you?"
- "I'm here to help you."
- Noel's smile flickers. "I'm handling it."
- Eben, looking at the chaos: "That's one word for it."

### Wound Setup
- Eben's internal: *Clean execution. That was the job. Get in, fix the logistics, get out before—before what? Before it became something he couldn't leave.*

### Chapter Hook
Noel says something sharp. Eben says something sharper. It's going to be a long twelve days.

## Chapter 3: Competence Clash  
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content

- **The dynamic:** Noel resents being "handled," Eben just does things without asking

2. Noel's irritation: *"He had the energy of a man who alphabetized his underwear and judged people silently for not doing the same."*
3. They disagree about approach. Both are right. Neither will admit it.
4. A moment where they accidentally coordinate perfectly—then pretend it didn't happen
5. Hugh appears, covered in glitter: "Glitter emergency! Handled!"

### Comic Beat
Hugh observing them: "You two make a very efficient picture. Very... intense."

- Wes: *sips coffee pointedly, says nothing*

### Eben Observation

4. *"He did not hate this."*
5. Noel appears in the doorway, needing something from storage

### The Gloves

## Chapter 6: Working Together
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,500

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Hall + Square, evening setup rush
- **The shift:** They're cooperating now. Actually cooperating.

### Noel's POV Beats
1. They develop a rhythm—Noel handles people, Eben handles systems
2. They finish each other's crisis responses without discussing it
3. Internal: *"This is fine. This is just efficiency. We're just efficient. This is—why is he looking at me like that."*

### Eben's POV Beats
1. He finds himself anticipating what Noel needs
2. Catches himself going out of his way to solve problems Noel would have struggled with
3. Internal: *"It was professional courtesy. Obviously. The fact that Noel smiled at him—genuinely smiled, not the performer smile—after he fixed the sound system was irrelevant."*

### Physical Tension
- They're close in the rush. Arms brush. Neither moves away.
- A moment where Eben steadies Noel (who nearly trips over a cable)
- Hand on arm. Brief. Electric.
- Both pretend it didn't happen.

### Chapter Hook

- Noel and Eben exchange a look
- Internal: *"They'd done that. Together. It shouldn't feel like anything."*
- *"It felt like something."*

### Cozy Texture

## Chapter 8: Hook Ending
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~800

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Merryweather Hall, late, nearly empty
- **The moment:** Day 1 complete. What now?

- Eben: "Same time."
- Noel: "You don't have to—"
- Eben: "I'll be here."
- *Pause.*
- Noel: "Temporary."
- Eben: "Temporary."

### Internal Truth
Eben's internal: *"Temporary. Of course. Everything was temporary. Eben knew that better than anyone. That was why he didn't do—whatever this was threatening to become."*

*"He didn't do it because things ended. People left. Attachment was a promise to lose something."*

*"'Temporary,' he said, and it tasted like a lie."*

### Final Line Hook
*"Outside, the snow was falling on Tinsel Town, and Eben Frost stood in an empty hall and pretended he didn't already know that nothing about this was going to be temporary at all."*
