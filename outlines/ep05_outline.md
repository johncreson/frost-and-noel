**Date:** December 18 (Day 5 of 12)

---

## Chapter 1: Sponsor Arrives
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Opening Hook
*"The sponsor assumed they were a couple. To be fair, they were standing too close together, had matching exhaustion, and were covered in traces of mutual glitter. An understandable mistake."*

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Merryweather Hall, morning
- **The chaos:** Sponsor representative arrives, assumes everything

### Beats to Hit
1. Big sponsor representative here for the festival
2. Sees Noel and Eben coordinating
3. "Oh, you're the couple! How charming."
4. Noel freezes. Eben freezes.
5. Mayor Kringle, panicking, doesn't correct them

### The Assumption
*"'Family values are very important to our brand,' the sponsor said, smiling. 'It's so nice to see young people building something together.'"*

*"Noel wanted to explain that they weren't building anything. They were imploding. Slowly. With excellent logistics."*

### Chapter Hook
Mayor pulls them aside. Problem.

---

## Chapter 2: The Agreement
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,300

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Private room, Merryweather Hall
- **The proposal:** Fake dating. For the festival.

### The Conversation
1. Mayor: "The sponsor thinks you're together. This is good for the festival."
2. Noel: "We're not—"
3. Mayor: "For three days. Just until they leave."
4. Eben and Noel exchange a look
5. Agreement. Boundaries set. Rules made.

### The Rules
- "We act like a couple in public."
- "Strictly professional otherwise."
- "This changes nothing."
*"These were good rules. Clear rules. Rules that were absolutely going to be broken."*

### Internal
*"Fake dating. Because what they needed right now was to pretend to be something they were already failing to not be."*

### Chapter Hook
Time to perform.

---

## Chapter 3: The Performance
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,500

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Town tour for the sponsor
- **The act:** Playing couple for the cameras

### Beats to Hit
1. Walking together through Tinsel Town
2. Sponsor delighted by everything
3. Required hand-holding for optics
4. The performance feels... real
5. Too real

### The Performance Problem
- Noel's hand in Eben's is warm
- They fit together naturally
- Internal (Eben): *"This would be easier if touching him didn't feel like coming home. That was a concerning metaphor."*
- Internal (Noel): *"Just pretend. Just perform. Don't notice how his hand tightens when someone else talks to you."*

### Photo Moment
- Sponsor wants a picture. "Look natural!"
- Neither knows what "natural" looks like anymore
- The photo: they're looking at each other instead of the camera
- *"Very convincing. Unfortunately."*

### Chapter Hook
Someone flirts with Noel.

---

## Chapter 4: Jealousy Spark
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Garland Cup, sponsor meeting
- **The trigger:** Someone flirts with Noel. Eben does not handle it well.

### The Incident
1. Local business owner, charming, interested
2. Leans too close to Noel. Touches his arm.
3. Noel is polite. Professional.
4. Eben is... not polite
5. Hand on Noel's back. Possessive. Obvious.

### Internal Meltdown
*"He wasn't jealous. The man talking to Noel was simply standing too close, speaking too loudly, and existing too aggressively. This wasn't jealousy. This was... spatial awareness."*

*"The hand on Noel's back was positioning. For the performance. Obviously."*

*"The way his jaw clenched was unrelated."*

### The Aftermath
- The man leaves. Eben's hand stays.
- Noel, quietly: "That was interesting."
- Eben: "Standard couple behavior."
- Noel: "Mmm."
- *"He wasn't fooled. Eben wasn't either."*

### Chapter Hook
Noel is going to call him on it.

---

## Chapter 5: Confrontation
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,300

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Behind the café, semi-private
- **The moment:** Noel names what's happening

### The Call-Out
1. "You're jealous."
2. "I'm not jealous."
3. "Your hand was on my back for ten minutes."
4. "That's positioning."
5. "It wasn't there before he started talking to me."
6. "...Coincidence."

### The Truth
*"'Eben.' Noel's voice was soft now. 'We have rules. Between us, remember? Temporary. Unless you don't want it to be.'"*

*"The silence stretched. Eben didn't answer. But he didn't say no."*

### The Shift
- Something changes in the air
- The fake dating isn't fake anymore
- Neither admits it
- Both know

### Chapter Hook
Evening event. Photos. Performance.

---

## Chapter 6: Evening Event
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Evening reception for sponsor
- **The performance:** Photos, public couple, scrutiny

### Beats to Hit
1. Reception with sponsor and town leaders
2. Noel and Eben, performing couple-hood
3. More comfortable now. Too comfortable.
4. Hugh watching with fascination: "This is *fascinating*."
5. Photo session—the sponsor photos that will surface later

### The Photos
- Professional photographer for sponsor
- "Look like you're in love."
- *"That wasn't difficult. That was the problem."*
- The photos capture something real
- (These photos = EP9 catalyst)

### Performance Cracks
- After a photo, their eyes meet
- Eben's hand lingers on Noel's waist
- Noel leans in without thinking
- *"The line between fake and real had smudged beyond recognition."*

### Chapter Hook
Reception ends. They're alone.

---

## Chapter 7: Private Moment
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,800

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Empty room off the reception hall
- **THE SCENE:** Signature dynamic introduction

### The Setup
- Noel exhausted from performing
- Eben noticing, concerned
- Private room, door closed

### The Dynamic
1. Eben, quiet: "Sit."
2. Noel sinks into a chair without thinking
3. Eben checks his hands. His face. Looking for strain.
4. "Good."
5. Noel's eyes flutter closed

### The Praise Pattern
*"That one word. 'Good.' It shouldn't have undone him. It was just a word. But the way Eben said it—low, approving, like Noel had done something right just by existing—something in Noel's chest unlocked."*

- Eben guides him into rest
- Not sexual—tender, caretaking
- The pattern is established: praise + surrender
- *"This is what they are. What they could be."*

### The Acknowledgment
- Noel, soft: "Unless you don't want it to be fake."
- Eben's hand on his face, thumb brushing his cheek
- "I don't know what I want."
- "Then figure it out."
- *"He would. They both would. The problem was that the answer was already obvious."*

### Chapter Hook
They leave together.

---

## Chapter 8: Hook Ending
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~900

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Walking home through snow
- **The realization:** "Temporary" is crumbling

### Beats to Hit
1. Walking through the quiet town
2. Sponsor visit successful
3. "We made it convincing."
4. "Did we?"
5. Neither elaborates

### Internal Truth
*"Temporary, Eben had said. Fake, they had agreed. Between us, the rule stated."*

*"He was holding Noel's hand. Not for the performance. The sponsor wasn't watching. No one was watching."*

*"He just didn't want to let go."*

### Final Line
*"Snow fell on Tinsel Town, and Eben Frost walked through it holding Noel Merrick's hand, and thought: I'm in so much trouble."*
