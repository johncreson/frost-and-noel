## Comprehensive Chapter Outline

**POV:** Dual (Noel/Eben alternating)
**Heat Level:** Afterglow Intimacy + Boundary
**Date:** December 17 (Day 4 of 12)

---

## Chapter 1: The Morning After
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Opening Hook
*"Noel woke up alone, which was fine. Normal. The sheets on the other side were cold. Also fine. He was going to be absolutely, aggressively fine about this."*

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Noel's apartment → Merryweather Hall
- **Noel's state:** Eben left. No note. Conflicting feelings.

### Beats to Hit
1. Empty bed. Coffee cold. Messages from Eben: none.
2. Getting ready with unusual care (choosing what to wear, then pretending he didn't)
3. Internal spiral: *"What does this mean? Does he want more? Do I want more? What are we?"*
4. Arriving at the Hall, determined to talk
5. Eben is professional. Distant. Barely meets his eyes.

### Wound Activation
*"There it was. The familiar sinking. He was only lovable when useful, and now that the usefulness of the night was over—"*
*"No. He was not going to spiral. Not yet. Not until he knew for certain."*

### Chapter Hook
Noel's stomach drops. This isn't what he expected.

## Chapter 2: The Distance
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Merryweather Hall, morning
- **Eben's state:** Panicking. Covering it with professionalism.

### Beats to Hit
1. He couldn't sleep after leaving Noel
2. Internal justification: *"This was a mistake. I don't do this. I don't want—"*
3. *"He wants."*
4. Decision: distance is safer. Acts cold.
5. Sees the hurt flash across Noel's face. Hates himself. Does it anyway.

### Internal Conflict
*"Professional distance. Crisp. Efficient. He was doing a stellar job of pretending last night hadn't fundamentally rearranged his understanding of physical chemistry. Of emotional chemistry. Of chemistry generally."*

*"Noel was looking at him like he wanted an answer to a question he hadn't asked yet. Eben didn't have an answer. Eben barely had a functioning cardiovascular system right now."*

### Chapter Hook
They have to work together on caroling prep. Close quarters. Can't avoid.

## Chapter 3: Caroling Prep
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Evergreen Square, afternoon setup
- **The event:** Community Caroling Night

### Beats to Hit
1. Stage, sound system, crowd management—forced togetherness
2. They work together like a machine. Too well.
3. Hugh: "You two are telepathic now. It's creepy."
4. Noel smiles for the crowd. It doesn't reach his eyes.
5. Eben catches it. Pretends not to.

### Town Optics
- Mayor Kringle, delighted: "Great chemistry! This will photograph beautifully!"
- Neither corrects him
- The town already thinks they're together
- *"If only the town knew how spectacularly wrong it was going."*

### The Scarf Detail
- It's cold. Noel forgot his scarf (actually, didn't own that one)
- He's wearing Eben's scarf from storage
- Neither mentions it
- *"It smelled like Eben. Noel was absolutely not thinking about this."*

### Chapter Hook
Sound check. One hour until the crowd arrives.

## Chapter 4: The Crisis
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Evergreen Square, evening
- **The disaster:** Sound system fails mid-event

### Beats to Hit
1. Caroling starts beautifully. Town gathered.
2. Sound system dies. Spectacularly.
3. Crowd murmurs. Mayor panics.
4. Eben: already moving to the equipment
5. Noel: already calming the crowd, leading acoustic caroling

### The Scarf Beat
- In the chaos, Eben's scarf falls while he's working on equipment
- Noel picks it up. Wraps it around his own neck without thinking.
- Eben fixes the sound. Noel keeps the town singing.
- Sound returns: applause!
- *"Noel realized he was still wearing Eben's scarf. He didn't take it off."*

### Victory Moment
- They did it. Again. Together.
- Exchange a look across the crowd
- *"Everything Eben tried to suppress was in that look. Noel's breath caught."*

### Chapter Hook
Event over. They're alone.

---

## Chapter 5: The Save
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Evergreen Square stage, post-event
- **The moment:** Victory look becomes something else

### Beats to Hit
1. Event success. Town cheering.
2. Noel on stage, watching the crowd
3. Eben at the tech table, watching Noel
4. Eyes meet across the square
5. Neither looks away for too long

### The Tension
*"That look. It said everything neither of them was willing to say out loud. It said 'last night meant something.' It said 'I don't know how to be normal about this.' It said 'please don't make me pretend it didn't happen.'"*

### The Approach
- Cleanup done. Crowd gone.
- They end up near each other
- The air is loaded
- Noel: "We should talk."

### Chapter Hook
Eben doesn't run.

## Chapter 6: The Talk
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Behind Merryweather Hall, night
- **THE MOMENT:** Eben draws the boundary

### The Conversation
1. They're alone. Tree lights in the distance.
2. Noel: "Was last night a mistake?"
3. Eben's throat tight: "No."
4. "Then what is this?"
5. Eben can't say what he wants. Says safety instead.

### The Boundary
- "This should stay between us. For the festival."
- Noel's face goes carefully blank
- "Between us," Noel repeats
- "It's easier," Eben says
- *He doesn't believe it. Noel can tell.*

### Eben's Internal
*"This was the right thing. Protection. For both of them. Noel didn't need to get tangled up in Eben's—whatever this was. Eben didn't need to get attached to someone he'd have to leave."*

*"The problem was that he was already tangled. Already attached. Already everything he'd promised himself he wouldn't be."*

### Chapter Hook
Noel's face is blank. That's worse than anger.

---

## Chapter 7: Hook Ending
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,000

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Noel's apartment, late night
- **The aftermath:** Hurt but not broken

### Beats to Hit
1. Home alone. Apartment too quiet.
2. Internal spiral: *"Between us. Temporary. Secret."*
3. Wound echoes: *"I'm only worth keeping when I'm useful."*
4. Useful. Is that all he is?
5. But—Eben said it wasn't a mistake.

### The Decision
*"He wasn't going to push. That wasn't how Noel Merrick operated. He gave people space. He let them come to him. He made himself useful and hoped it was enough."*

*"But he also wasn't going to pretend last night didn't happen. That wasn't an option anymore."*

### Tomorrow Setup
- Day 5. Sponsor arrives.
- External pressure incoming.
- "Between us" will be challenged.

### Final Line
*"Noel stared at the ceiling and thought: If he wants temporary, I can do temporary. I can do anything except pretend last night didn't matter."*
