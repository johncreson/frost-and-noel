---

## Chapter 1: Morning Friction
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Opening Hook
*"Noel had spent all night not thinking about Eben Frost. This required such an aggressive amount of not-thinking that he'd barely slept, which rather defeated the purpose."*

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Noel's apartment → Merryweather Hall, early morning
- **Noel's state:** Sleep-deprived, overcaffeinated, pretending hard

### Beats to Hit
1. Noel arrives expecting to be first—Eben already there, coffee made
2. "You're early." "I'm on time. You're late."
3. The coffee is good. Noel hates that it's good.
4. Internal: *"He made coffee. That doesn't mean anything. People make coffee. It's a normal thing. Stop reading into coffee."*
5. Tension from yesterday hasn't dissipated—it's concentrated

### Chapter Hook
Hugh arrives with "bad news" about the planning room.

## Chapter 2: The Room Problem
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,500

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Merryweather Hall → Everhart Crafts → tiny backup office
- **The problem:** Hugh's craft committee has claimed the main room

### Beats to Hit
1. Hugh: "Sorry, we booked three months ago! Glitter emergency!"
2. Hugh "insists" they need supplies—drags them to Everhart Crafts
3. **EVERHART CRAFTS SCENE:**
   - The store is chaos: glitter everywhere, hot glue smell, aggressive holiday music
   - Hugh hands them a "quick project" while they wait
   - Eben's face = controlled horror
   - Noel trying not to laugh
   - They end up covered in glitter specs
4. Escape to the backup office—barely bigger than a closet
5. One desk. Two chairs. Knees nearly touching.

### Comic Beat
Eben, deadpan: "This is inefficient."
Noel: "This is my life."
Eben: "...I'm sorry."
Noel: *actually laughs*

### Glitter Detail
*"The glitter would haunt them for days. Every time Noel thought he'd gotten rid of it, he'd find another spec. On his collar. In his hair. Catching the light like some kind of festive accusation."*

### Chapter Hook
They're stuck. Very close. For the whole day.

## Chapter 3: Competence Tension
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,300

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Tiny office, mid-morning
- **The problem:** Eben keeps watching Noel. Can't stop.

### Beats to Hit
1. Noel works, oblivious to being studied
2. Eben notices details he shouldn't: the way Noel bites his lip, the tired lines around his eyes, the way he laughs at nothing
3. Internal: *"Stop. This is not your concern."*
4. Noel catches him looking. Eben doesn't look away fast enough.
5. "What?" "...Nothing."

### Physical Awareness
- The room is small. They can hear each other breathe.
- Eben is hyperaware of every movement
- *"The room was approximately the size of a confession booth, which felt appropriate given what was about to happen."*

### Shift Moment
- Noel says something self-deprecating
- Eben responds seriously: "You're good at this."
- Noel goes still. "What?"
- Eben, already regretting: "The festival. You're good at it."
- *Something changes in the air.*

### Chapter Hook
They need coffee. They're going to have to leave this room together.

## Chapter 4: The Town Interrupts
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Garland Cup (coffee shop), midday
- **The function:** External perspective on their dynamic

### Beats to Hit
1. Coffee run = escape from tiny room tension
2. Walking through town together, too close
3. Wes at the counter: "You two look cozy."
4. Noel: "We're working." (unconvincing)
5. **Eben orders for Noel—correctly—without asking**

### The Order Beat
- Noel: "How did you know my order?"
- Eben: "You mentioned it yesterday."
- (He didn't. Eben just... knows.)
- Internal: *"He paid attention. Why does that matter? Why does everything he does feel like it matters?"*

### Town Observation
- The barista gives them a knowing look
- An older townsperson: "Nice to see young people getting along!"
- Noel wants to scream

### Chapter Hook
They have to go back to that tiny room.

## Chapter 5: Late Night Work
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Tiny office, evening into night
- **The tension:** Too tired to fight. Too aware to relax.

### Beats to Hit
1. Hours pass. The hall empties around them.
2. They're alone. Have been for a while.
3. Neither suggests leaving.
4. "Go home." "You're still here." "That's different."
5. "How is that different?" / Eben doesn't answer.

### Exhaustion Intimacy
- Walls are down. Too tired to maintain them.
- Noel catches himself staring at Eben's hands
- The glitter is still visible. Should have washed off by now.
- *"Neither of them had tried very hard to remove it."*

### The Quiet
- No sound but their breathing
- The building creaking
- Snow against windows
- *"Intimate. That was the word Noel was avoiding. This felt intimate."*

### Chapter Hook
Noel asks the question.

---

## Chapter 6: Vulnerability Slip
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Tiny office, late night
- **The moment:** First real vulnerability from Eben

### Beats to Hit
1. Quiet has settled. Pretense is thin.
2. Noel, soft: "Why did you take this job?"
3. Eben should lie. Say "the mayor asked."
4. Instead: "I don't know."
5. The honesty surprises both of them.

### The Admission
- Noel: "That's not an answer."
- Eben: "It's the truth."
- *Pause.*
- Noel: "You could have said no."
- Eben: "I could have."
- Noel: "But you didn't."
- Eben: "...I didn't."

### The Room Shifts
*"The room felt smaller. Or maybe Eben felt larger. Specifically, his chest felt too large for his ribcage, which was concerning from a cardiovascular standpoint and absolutely devastating from an emotional one."*

### Chapter Hook
One of them reaches for papers. Hands brush.

---

## Chapter 7: The Kiss
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Tiny office, very late night
- **THE MOMENT:** First kiss

### The Build
1. Hands brushing over papers. Neither pulls away.
2. Stillness. Eye contact.
3. Eben: "Noel." (First name use—intimate, deliberate)
4. Noel's breath catches.
5. Pause. Silent question in the look.

### The Kiss
*"Noel didn't answer with words. He leaned in."*

- First contact: soft, questioning
- Then less soft. Much less soft.
- Eben's hand on Noel's jaw
- Noel grabbing Eben's collar
- The papers scatter—neither notices

### Consent Beat
- The pause before = asking
- The eye contact = permission
- Noel initiating = answering

### The Aftermath
*"When they pulled apart, the silence was different. Charged. Something had happened that couldn't unhappen."*
- Both breathing hard
- Neither moves away
- "Well," Eben said, after approximately seventeen years. "That happened."

### Chapter Hook
What now?

---

## Chapter 8: Hook Ending
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~800

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Tiny office → parking lot, late night
- **The dynamic:** Pretending it didn't happen (badly)

### Beats to Hit
1. They separate. Stare at each other.
2. Eben: "We should—" / Noel: "Yeah."
3. Packing up in loaded silence
4. Walking out together, not touching
5. "See you tomorrow." "Six AM."
6. Neither mentions the kiss.

### Parking Lot
- Noel gets in his car. Sits there.
- Doesn't drive. Can't drive.
- Internal: *"What did I just do? What did we just—how am I supposed to—"*
- Watches Eben's taillights disappear

### Final Line Hook
*"Noel sat in his car until Eben's taillights disappeared, and thought about nothing but that kiss for the rest of the night."*

## Key Callbacks to Plant
- [ ] First use of "Noel" (significant)
- [ ] Glitter as visible evidence
- [ ] Knowing the coffee order
- [ ] The tiny room as pressure cooker
- [ ] "That happened" as Eben's processing
