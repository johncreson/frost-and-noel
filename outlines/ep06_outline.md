## Chapter 1: Farm Arrival
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,400

*"The goats escaped four times. This was considered a moderate success for a farm charity event."*

3. Noel in his element—charming, organizing, handling
4. Eben looking vaguely alarmed at the lack of structure
5. Their dynamic from EP5 carries—closer now

### Farm Chaos

### The Shift
- They're not pretending distance anymore
- Working together comes naturally
- The town notices. Says nothing.
- *"Whatever they were, it was obvious to everyone except, apparently, them."*

### Chapter Hook
A goat makes a break for it.

*"'Brisk walking.'"*

4. Doesn't ask. Just does it.
5. Noel goes very still

- Eben: "You're cold."
- Noel: "That's not—"
- Eben: "You're welcome."

5. The child eventually pets the lamb, beaming

### Noel Watches
*"There it was again. Eben Frost, the man who organized his emotions like spreadsheets, being unexpectedly, devastatingly kind."*

- Eben: "This."
- Noel: "Us. Whatever we are. I want it to be real."

### The Answer
*"Eben was quiet for so long that Noel's chest started to ache. And then—"*

*"'It's real.' Two words. Simple. Everything."*

### The Escalation

- Hands finding purchase
- "Tell me if—" "Yes." "I need you to—" "Yes."
- More explicit asks. Clearer boundaries.
- *"Trust deepening with every word."*

### Chapter Hook
They don't go further. Not tonight. But they've crossed a line.

### Setup for Tomorrow
- Festival continues
- Ice rink event tomorrow
- Things are moving. Building.

### Final Line
*"He fell asleep that night with Eben's scarf still around his neck, and dreamed about nothing at all, which was the best sleep he'd had in years."*
