## Chapter 1: Morning After Rupture
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,200

### Opening Hook
*"The storm arrived like a metaphor. Eben would have appreciated it more if he wasn't standing in the middle of a charity event watching Noel pretend he was fine while clearly not fine."*

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Noel's apartment, morning
- **Noel's state:** Survival mode. Mask on.

### Beats to Hit
1. Waking up alone—the bed is cold
2. Going through the motions: shower, clothes, coffee
3. Internal: *This is fine. I've done this before.*
4. Mask ready. Smile practiced.
5. *"Nobody gets to see him break."*

### Wound Active
*"'Useful = worthy.' That was the equation. The only equation that worked. So he would be useful. He would work. He would not think about last night."*

### Chapter Hook
Charity event today. Same space. Same town. Same Eben.

## Chapter 2: Same Space, Different World
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Evergreen Square, charity tree haul setup
- **The dynamic:** Professional proximity, personal devastation

### Beats to Hit
1. They both arrive. Eyes meet.
2. *Neither knows what to say.*
3. They fall into work mode—coordinating through others
4. The town notices. Whispers.
5. Wes, quietly to Noel: "What happened?"
6. "Nothing."

### The Distance
*"Working in the same space had never felt so far apart."*

- They communicate through other people
- Avoid direct contact
- But keep tracking each other's positions
- *"Orbiting. Never touching."*

### Chapter Hook
Storm clouds building.

## Chapter 3: The Storm Arrives

- **THE SCENE:** Storm + Sam confrontation

### The Weather
1. Storm rolling in fast
2. Event needs to evacuate indoors
3. Eben offers Frost Line Logistics as shelter
4. **First visit to Eben's space**

### The Space
*"Organized. Minimal. No personal touches. This was where Eben pretended he wasn't pining."*

*"Noel in his space felt wrong. And right. And devastating."*

### SAM'S CONFRONTATION
*"Sam cornered him in the warehouse. No warning. No warmth."*

- "You're doing that thing you do."
- "What thing."
- "Destroying something before it can hurt you."
- *Silence.*
- "Wes told me you were good for Noel. I believed him."
- *"Was he wrong?"*

### The Gut Punch
*"That was the question, wasn't it. Was he wrong? Had Eben ever been good for anyone?"*

### Chapter Hook
Noel is here. In his space. Not looking at him.

## Chapter 4: The Yearning
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,300

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Frost Line Logistics, during storm
- **The moment:** Missing him, won't admit it

### The Warehouse
1. Strange to be in Eben's space
2. So organized. So controlled.
3. *"So empty."*
4. Brief stillness while storm rages outside

### Internal
*"Don't miss him. Don't miss him. He made his choice."*

*"But Eben was across the room, and Noel's whole body knew exactly where he was. That was the cruelest part—he couldn't stop feeling him."*

### The Look
- Their eyes meet across the space
- Neither looks away
- *"Everything. Nothing. The distance between them felt infinite."*
- Then someone calls Noel's name
- The moment breaks

### Chapter Hook
They're going to almost talk.

---

## Chapter 5: Almost Conversation
**POV:** Dual | **Word Target:** ~1,300

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Behind shelving / semi-private area
- **The attempt:** They almost talk. Don't quite get there.

### The Moment
1. Ended up alone. Accidentally.
2. Silence. Loaded.
3. Eben: "Noel—"
4. Noel: "Don't."
5. Eben: "I need to—"
6. Noel: "Not today. Please."

### The Crack
*"His voice cracked on 'please.'"*

*"Eben went still. He wanted to push. He didn't."*

### The Separation
- They walk away in different directions
- Nothing resolved
- But Noel said "please"—and that was more honest than anything

### Chapter Hook
Storm is clearing.

---

## Chapter 6: The Realization
**POV:** Eben | **Word Target:** ~1,400

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Frost Line Logistics, storm clearing
- **THE MOMENT:** Eben realizes what he's losing

### The Empty Space
1. Storm passes. People leave.
2. Noel was first to go—efficient, mechanical, no goodbye
3. Eben stands alone in his warehouse
4. **For the first time, it feels wrong. Too quiet.**

### Internal Reckoning
*"I built this. All of this. Walls and systems and distance."*

*"And now I'm standing in the middle of it, alone."*

*"Sam's words echo: 'Destroying something before it can hurt you.'"*

*"Noel was here. Noel is gone. That's—"*

*"That's not acceptable."*

### The Decision
*"I said 'this was never supposed to last' and he believed me."*

*"He believed me because I made him believe me."*

*"I have to fix this. Tomorrow. Christmas Eve."*

### Chapter Hook
Tomorrow is the last chance.

---

## Chapter 7: Hook Ending
**POV:** Noel | **Word Target:** ~1,000

### Scene Content
- **Setting:** Noel's apartment, night
- **The precipice:** Close to giving up

### Alone
1. Home. Quiet. Too quiet.
2. Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.
3. The festival ends the day after.
4. "And then... what?"

### The Question
*"He goes back to his life without Eben?"*

*"The thought feels like a death."*

*"But he doesn't know how to ask someone to stay who said they never would."*

### The Wound
*"Maybe temporary was always the only thing I was ever going to get."*

*"Maybe 'useful' was as good as it gets."*

*"Maybe—"*

### Final Line
*"Noel stared at the empty side of his bed and thought: Maybe temporary was always the only thing I was ever going to get."*
