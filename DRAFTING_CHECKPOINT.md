## ✍️ WRITING STYLE REMINDERS

### Voice Specifications
- **Person:** Close third-person limited (dual POV)
- **Tense:** Past tense
- **Tone:** Casual, irreverent, snarky
- **Dialogue:** Heavy, naked (minimal tags)
- **Narrator:** Witty, deadpan, opinionated

### Key Patterns
- **Noel's voice:** Warmer, breathless when stressed, self-deprecating humor
- **Eben's voice:** Drier, controlled, devastating rare humor
- **Chapter breaks:** Every scene change = new chapter
- **Banter ratio:** 70% playful / 30% sincere (early eps) → 50/50 by EP8 → 30/70 during rupture

### Signature Phrases (Use Sparingly)
- "I'm fine" (Noel) - 1x per episode max
- "Temporary" (Both) - the central lie (EP1-8 only)
- "Stay" (Both) - the truth (EP8+)
- "Good" (Eben) - praise, meaningful scenes only
- First name use (Eben→Noel) - rare, earned, intimate

## 🔥 HEAT PROGRESSION

| Episodes | Heat Level | Key Elements |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| EP1 | Tease | Charged tension, accidental touches |
| EP2 | First Kiss | Soft → desperate, consent beat |
| EP3 | First Sex | "Look at me" moment, aftercare |
| EP4-6 | Established | Intimacy deepening, emotional vulnerability |
| EP7 | Caretaking | Injury → tenderness, first overnight |
| EP8 | Commitment | First "I love you," commitment-coded sex |
| EP9-10 | Rupture | Physical distance mirrors emotional |
| EP11-12 | Repair → HEA | Reconnection, commitment |

**Heat Writing Rules:**
- Consent is explicit and sexy ("May I?" / "Do you want...")
- Praise dynamics: "Good" lands like a touch
- Avoid purple prose (no "member," "core," "essence")
- Aftercare is part of the scene, not separate
- Focus on emotional intimacy over mechanics

## 📝 NOTES FOR NEXT WRITER

- Episodes 1-8 establish strong voice and pacing—maintain consistency
- The witty narrator is a key character; don't lose that voice
- Dual POV alternates by chapter, not within chapters (except designated dual chapters)
- Every chapter ends with a hook—question, revelation, or emotional shift
- Episode 9 is THE RUPTURE - this is where everything breaks
- The rupture must feel earned but devastating
- Eben's wound (attachment destroys) drives the break
- Heat scenes focus on emotional intimacy; physical details serve character revelation
- Cozy textures ground every episode—this is a holiday romance, lean into warmth

**The foundation is solid. Episodes 9-12 will complete the series! 🎄✨**
