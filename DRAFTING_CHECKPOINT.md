## ✍️ WRITING STYLE REMINDERS

### Voice Specifications
- **Person:** Close third-person limited (dual POV)
- **Tense:** Past tense
- **Tone:** Casual, irreverent, snarky
- **Dialogue:** Heavy, naked (minimal tags)
- **Narrator:** Witty, deadpan, opinionated

### Key Patterns
- **Noel's voice:** Warmer, breathless when stressed, self-deprecating humor
- **Eben's voice:** Drier, controlled, devastating rare humor
- **Chapter breaks:** Every scene change = new chapter
- **Banter ratio:** 70% playful / 30% sincere (early eps) → shifts over time

### Signature Phrases (Use Sparingly)
- "I'm fine" (Noel) - 1x per episode max
- "Temporary" (Both) - the central lie
- "Good" (Eben) - praise, meaningful scenes only
- First name use (Eben→Noel) - rare, earned, intimate

## 🔥 HEAT PROGRESSION

| Episodes | Heat Level | Key Elements |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| EP1 | Tease | Charged tension, accidental touches |
| EP2 | First Kiss | Soft → desperate, consent beat |
| EP3 | First Sex | "Look at me" moment, aftercare |
| EP4-6 | Established | Intimacy deepening, emotional vulnerability |
| EP7 | Peak Intimacy | First "I love you" |
| EP8-10 | Rupture | Physical distance mirrors emotional |
| EP11-12 | Repair → HEA | Reconnection, commitment |

**Heat Writing Rules:**
- Consent is explicit and sexy ("May I?" / "Do you want...")
- Praise dynamics: "Good" lands like a touch
- Avoid purple prose (no "member," "core," "essence")
- Aftercare is part of the scene, not separate
- Focus on emotional intimacy over mechanics

## 💡 TIPS FOR EFFICIENT DRAFTING

1. **Batch Similar Chapters:** Draft all "morning arrival" scenes together, all "late night" scenes together
2. **Use Outline Beats:** The outlines are comprehensive—trust them
3. **Voice Consistency:** Read previous chapters before starting new ones
4. **Word Count Targets:** Aim for 1,200-1,500 per chapter; don't stress exact counts
5. **Dialogue First:** When stuck, write the dialogue beats, then fill in action/internal
6. **Trust the Tropes:** The troperator guides show how tropes drive each chapter
7. **Cozy Textures:** Include at least one smell, tactile, light, and food detail per episode

- **Date:** December 17 (Day 4 of 12)
- **Heat Level:** Established intimacy
- **Word Target:** 12,000-15,000 words
- **Major Beats:** Morning after awkwardness → defining the relationship → public vs private → deepening connection

## 📝 NOTES FOR NEXT WRITER

- Episodes 1-2 establish strong voice and pacing—maintain consistency
- The witty narrator is a key character; don't lose that voice
- Dual POV alternates by chapter, not within chapters (except designated dual chapters)
- Every chapter ends with a hook—question, revelation, or emotional shift
- The "temporary" lie is the series engine—keep it present until the rupture
- Heat scenes focus on emotional intimacy; physical details serve character revelation
- Cozy textures ground every episode—this is a holiday romance, lean into warmth

**Good luck! The foundation is solid. Keep the momentum going! 🎄✨**
