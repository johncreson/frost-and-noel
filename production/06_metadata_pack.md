## Series Blurb

### One-Line Hook
Two men. Twelve days. One lie that won't last until Christmas.

### Short Blurb (100 words)
When overworked event director Noel Merrick is forced to share command of Tinsel Town's Twelve Days to Christmas festival with cold, competent logistics fixer Eben Frost, sparks fly—along with flour, schedules, and every carefully maintained boundary.

Noel smiles through exhaustion because he's only worth keeping when he's useful.
Eben controls everything because attachment always ends in loss.

They agree this is temporary. Professional. Absolutely not personal.

The town disagrees. So does Noel's heart. And Eben's hands keep forgetting the rules.

*Low angst. High heat. Grumpy/sunshine. Found family. Explicit. HEA guaranteed.*

### Long Blurb (150 words)
Noel Merrick has one job: save the Twelve Days to Christmas festival before his sleepless, overcommitted body gives out. He doesn't need help. He doesn't need a cold-eyed logistics expert critiquing his spreadsheets. And he definitely doesn't need Eben Frost looking at him like he's the most urgent problem in the room.

Eben Frost has one rule: don't get attached. But Noel Merrick is chaos in a sweater, and Eben can't seem to stop putting furniture in his path and whispering "sit" like it's a commandment.

Twelve days. Twelve setpieces. One relentlessly festive small town determined to marry them off.

They agree this is temporary.
They're both liars.

*A cozy MM holiday romance with low external stakes, high emotional intimacy, explicit open-door heat, and an HEA as guaranteed as the final parade.*
