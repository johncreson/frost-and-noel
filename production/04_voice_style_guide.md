# TINSEL TOWN: Noel & Eben
## Voice + Style Guide

---

## A) Prose Style Specifications

### Core Framework
| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Person** | Close Third-Person Limited (Dual POV) |
| **Tense** | Past (with occasional present-tense forays for emphasis) |
| **Tone** | Casual, irreverent, snarky |
| **Dialogue** | Raw, heavy, naked (minimal tags) |
| **Description** | Evocative, short bursts |
| **Narrative Voice** | Poignant with witty asides |
| **Focus** | Realism + character-driven |
| **Pace** | Fast |
| **Characters** | Gritty, flawed, revealed through action |
| **Paragraphs** | Short for impact; white space as punctuation |

### The Witty Narrator Voice
A snarky, vivid narrative with an opinionated voice. Blends:
- Sharp humor
- Dry commentary  
- Cautionary wisdom
- Gentle mocking of character flaws
- Suspense-building asides

The tone feels **knowing, entertaining, and slightly judgmental**—engaging readers with personality while building investment.

### Deadpan Narration
- State absurd things matter-of-factly
- Let the comedy emerge from the contrast
- Never explain the joke
- *"Eben Frost did not believe in love at first sight. He also didn't believe in second sight, or really any sight that led to feelings he'd have to manage."*

### Heavy Dialogue / Naked Dialogue
- Dialogue carries the scene
- Minimal attributions ("he said," "she asked")
- Let context and rhythm identify speakers
- Actions embedded in dialogue beats, not separate paragraphs

**Example:**
```
"You're early." Eben didn't look up from his spreadsheet.
"I'm on time. You're obsessive."
"That's one word for it."
Noel dropped into the chair across from him. "What's another?"
"Efficient."
"Delusional."
"Also accurate."
```

### Describe Characters Through Action
- No info dumps about appearance
- Reveal personality through choices and habits
- Physical details emerge naturally in motion
- *Not: "Noel had warm brown eyes and a friendly smile."*
- *Yes: "Noel smiled at the vendor like she'd just saved his life, which, considering the coffee situation, she basically had."*

### Fun to Read Aloud
- Rhythm matters
- Sentences should vary in length
- Punchlines land on short sentences
- Build with long; hit with short.

### Quirks
- Character-specific
- Odd but revealing
- Unpretentious
- *Eben's glove removal ritual. Noel's tendency to hum when stressed. Hugh's inability to enter a room without glitter.*

## B) Chapter & Scene Structure

### Chapter Breaks
- **Chapter break at every scene change**
- Include chapter indicator: `## Chapter [#]: [Title]`
- Each chapter = one scene
- Chapters flow in close continuation

### Scene-to-Chapter Mapping
- Invent business and structure within each chapter
- Expand beats into full scenes
- Maintain momentum across chapter breaks
- End chapters on hooks or shifts

## C) POV Rotation

- **Rotation:** Scene-based (not chapter-based)
