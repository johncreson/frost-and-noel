# Tinsel Town Season Planning Audit
## Comprehensive Review

---

## ✅ What's Working Well

### Heat Ladder Progression
Perfect escalation across all 12 episodes:
```
EP1:  Tease/Tension
EP2:  First Kiss
EP3:  First Sex (tender)
EP4:  Afterglow/Boundary
EP5:  Signature Dynamic
EP6:  Escalation
EP7:  Emotional Intimacy
EP8:  Commitment-Coded
EP9:  Rupture (no heat)
EP10: Yearning Restraint
EP11: Repair Sex
EP12: Celebration + Epilogue
```
**Verdict:** ✅ Matches the Heat Beat Library perfectly

### Character Wound Tracking
- Noel's "useful = lovable" → tracked through EP1, EP3, EP7, EP8, EP12
- Eben's "attachment destroys" → tracked through EP5, EP8, EP9, EP11
**Verdict:** ✅ Both arcs complete with clear progression

### Dialogue Must-Hits
Each episode has unique, non-repeating signature lines that serve the arc.
**Verdict:** ✅ Strong

## ⚠️ Gaps Identified

### 1. Underused Locations
| Location | Episodes Used | Issue |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Everhart Crafts** | 0 episodes | Never visited despite Hugh appearing in 10 episodes |
| **Frost Line Logistics** | 0 episodes | Eben's workspace never shown |
| **Garland Cup** | Only EP2, EP7, EP11 | Could use more comfort scenes |

**Recommendation:** Add Everhart Crafts scene in EP2 or EP4 (comic relief/proximity). Add Frost Line Logistics moment in EP5 or EP10 (Eben's private space).

### 2. Side Cast Distribution
| Character | Episodes | Issue |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Hugh Everhart** | 10/12 | Overused as "chaos" - could be more varied |
| **Sam Rook** | 4/12 (EP3, EP6, EP10, EP11) | Underused; should mirror Wes/Eben dynamic |
| **Mayor Kringle** | 6/12 | Good balance |
| **Wes Candle** | 7/12 | Good balance |

**Recommendation:** Give Sam a "wisdom" beat in EP9 or EP10 that parallels his role in the companion novella. Vary Hugh's function beyond "chaos."

### 3. Canon Facts Incomplete
| Fact | Status |
|------|--------|
| Noel's living situation | TBD |
| Eben's living situation | TBD |
| Noel's family | Not mentioned |
| Eben's family | Not mentioned |
| How long Eben has been in town | Not specified |

**Recommendation:** Fill these in the continuity bible before drafting.

### 4. Motif Tracking Gaps
| Motif | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| **Ribbon/bows** | Only EP1 explicitly |
| **Gloves** | EP1 (removal beat) - not tracked after |
| **Chair/rest** | EP5, EP7 - good |
| **Schedules** | Throughout - good |

**Recommendation:** Ensure ribbon/bow callback in EP8 (wrapping/unwrapping metaphor for commitment) and EP12 (final tie-together).

## 🔧 Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Add "Frost Line Logistics" Scene (EP5 or EP10)
- Show Eben's private workspace
- Use his whiteboard/organization as character reveal
- Contrast with Noel's chaotic warmth

### 2. Add "Everhart Crafts" Scene (EP2 or EP4)
- Hugh forces them into a couple craft activity
- Glitter disaster = comic relief
- Physical proximity in creative setting

### 3. Strengthen Sam Rook Role (EP9-10)
- Give Sam a scene where he confronts Eben during rupture
- "You're doing the thing where you ruin things before they ruin you"
- Mirrors Sam's steadiness from companion novella

### 4. Add Weather Element (EP10)
- Continuity bible mentions "storm episode planned at EP10"
- Current EP10 outline doesn't include storm
- Add: storm forces proximity during outdoor event

### 5. Complete Motif Arc
- EP8: Ribbon motif → Noel wraps something for Eben; symbol of choosing to tie together
- EP12: Return of gloves → Eben removing gloves in public = choosing vulnerability

### 6. Fill Canon TBDs
- Noel's apartment: above Merryweather Hall? Small but cozy?
- Eben's place: neat, minimal, outside town center?
- Backstory breadcrumbs: dropped once each in EP3, EP7, EP11

### 7. Strengthen EP9 Rupture Catalyst
Current: vague "public moment goes wrong"
Improvement: Make it specific—sponsor photos from EP5 surface; Mayor shows them publicly; Noel is outed before he's ready; Eben freezes instead of defending.

### 8. Add Signature Physical Beat Per Episode
Each episode should have ONE memorable physical moment:
- EP1: Gloves removal ✓
- EP2: First kiss ✓
- EP3: Flour in hair ✓
- EP4: ??? (Add: scarf exchange or shared body heat)
- EP5: Photo pose ✓
- EP6: Scarf wrap ✓
- EP7: Wrapped wrist ✓
- EP8: Sleeping together (actual sleep) ✓
- EP9: ??? (Add: almost-touch that doesn't happen)
- EP10: ??? (Add: caught staring moment)
- EP11: Forehead touch during repair ✓
- EP12: Public hand-holding ✓

**To make it great:**
- Fill the identified gaps (locations, side cast balance)
- Strengthen EP9's rupture catalyst
- Add the missing location scenes for world depth
- Complete motif tracking

These are polish items, not structural issues. The season is **ready to draft** with these improvements noted for execution.
