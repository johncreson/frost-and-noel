## C) Sex & Boundaries

### Hard No's (Both)
- Non-consensual anything
- Humiliation that lingers past the scene
- Public exposure without consent

### Soft Yes's / Evolving Interests
- Praise (Noel melts, Eben learns to give)
- Guided surrender (Noel receiving, Eben providing)
- Light control/structure (comfort, not domination)

### Signature Dynamic Rules
**"Guided Surrender" = structure as care**
- Eben provides: steadiness, "I've got you," permission to rest
- Noel receives: praise, being told he can stop, physical grounding
- Always consent-explicit and tender, never harsh

### Aftercare Defaults
- Food (cocoa, pastry, something warm)
- Blanket/coat draped
- Verbal check-in: "Still okay?" / "I'm here"
- Physical: hand on back, forehead touch

| Motif | Starting Meaning | Evolution |
|-------|------------------|-----------|

| **Gloves** | Eben's control, barrier | Removing = vulnerability |
| **Cocoa/coffee** | Comfort, pause | Shared ritual, intimacy |
| **Twinkle lights** | Festival, public | Private moments, romance |
| **Chair/rest** | Noel's refusal to stop | Permission to receive |
| **Schedules/checklists** | Control, work | Care expressed through structure |
