# TINSEL TOWN: Noel & Eben
## Series Bible

### Series Logline
In the relentlessly festive town of Tinsel Town, overworked holiday event director **Noel Merrick** and frost-hearted logistics fixer **Eben Frost** are forced to co-run a "Twelve Days to Christmas" festival. Each day brings a new cozy disaster, a deeper intimacy, and a steadily collapsing lie: that this is temporary.

### Series Promise
- **Cozy world, low external stakes:** festival mishaps, weather hiccups, sponsor drama, community chaos
- **High internal stakes:** being chosen, being enough, letting someone in
- **One couple across 12 short episodes:** escalating romance + escalating heat
- **Tone:** warm, funny, tender, sexy; minimal angst, maximum glow
- **Ending:** explicit commitment + future plan (HEA)

---

## Format

- **Season:** 12 novella "episodes" (10k–18k each)
- **Timeline:** "Twelve Days to Christmas" countdown (Dec 14–25), with Episode 12 landing on Christmas Eve/Day
- **POV recommendation:** dual close (Noel + Eben), either **1st person present** (rom-com intimacy) or **3rd close past** (smooth pacing). Choose one and keep it consistent.

---

## Heat & Intimacy Signature

**Heat level:** open-door explicit, 2–4 on-page scenes per episode (varies by arc point).
**Signature dynamic:** *praise + controlled surrender* (consensual, cozy, emotionally affirming).

- Eben's control shows up as *steadiness, structure, "I've got you."*
- Noel's "sunshine competence" hides a hunger for being told he can rest and still be wanted.

**Consent language:** clear, present, sexy.

**No-go boundaries (series tone protection):**
- Sexual violence
- Humiliation that lingers
- Cheating between MCs
- Big-trauma backstories that derail cozy tone
- "Miscommunication sitcom breakups"

## Theme Spine

### Noel's Core Belief
> "I'm lovable when I'm useful."

**Growth:** receiving care without earning it; asking directly; allowing softness.

### Eben's Core Belief
> "Attachment destroys what I build."

**Growth:** choosing connection as a strength; letting someone disrupt his systems.

## Main Characters

### Noel Merrick (Sunshine)
- **Role:** event director / community liaison / walking clipboard with a smile
- **Vibe:** charming, competent, kind, secretly exhausted
- **Outer goal:** save the festival, prove he can pull it off, keep sponsors happy
- **Inner need:** to be wanted when he's not performing helpfulness
- **Contradiction:** sunshine persona vs private "if I stop, I'll disappoint everyone"
- **Physical cues:** warm hands, expressive eyes, a laugh that turns into a sigh when he thinks nobody's listening
- **Sexual imprint:** praise melts him; being guided into rest feels like a confession

### Eben Frost (Grumpy)
- **Role:** logistics / operations / problem-solver-for-hire
- **Vibe:** blunt, disciplined, steady, quietly protective
- **Outer goal:** execute a flawless festival plan, keep chaos contained
- **Inner need:** safety in intimacy; permission to want someone
- **Contradiction:** control as armor vs control as care
- **Physical cues:** stillness, watchfulness, hands that fix everything, voice that goes soft only when it matters
- **Sexual imprint:** likes structure, consented control, and the moment Noel stops being "in charge" and just *takes*

### Nicknames & How They Land Romantically
- Noel calls him **"Frost"** when he's being annoying-cute.
- Eben calls him **"Merrick"** when he's trying not to admit he's fond.
- First time Eben says **"Noel"** softly is basically a plot climax.
