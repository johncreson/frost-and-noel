## BLURB

He's been running on empty for years.

Noel Merrick has always been the one holding everything together. The festival. The town. The smile that convinces everyone he's fine when he's anything but.

Eben sees through it. Has seen through it since day one.

And now, with the festival at its peak and Noel's exhaustion finally catching up—Eben does something unprecedented.

He takes care of him.

Not because the festival needs Noel functional. Not because it's efficient. But because Noel deserves to be cared for, and no one else seems to have noticed he's falling apart.

A quiet day. A shared meal. Permission to rest.

It's the smallest thing. It's everything.

**Day seven of twelve. Sometimes love is just showing up.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring caretaking, hurt/comfort, grumpy-sunshine dynamics, explicit heat, and a guaranteed HEA.*
