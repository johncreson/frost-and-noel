## Chapter 06: Morning Light

Eben woke up to sunlight and the weight of Noel's head on his chest.

For a moment, he just lay there, not moving, trying to memorize the feeling.

This was—different. This was trust.

Noel was still asleep, breathing slow and even. His bandaged wrist was visible on top of the blanket. His face was relaxed in a way Eben had never seen while he was awake.

He looked peaceful. Safe.

Eben's chest felt too full.

*I could get used to this,* he thought. *I shouldn't. But I could.*

Four days. They had four days left.

And then what?

Eben didn't know. He had a job. A life. Commitments that existed outside of Tinsel Town.

But he also had—this. Noel. The possibility of something more.

He didn't know how to make it work.

He just knew he wanted to try.

Noel stirred. Blinked awake. Looked up at Eben with sleepy eyes.

"Morning," Noel mumbled.

"Morning."

"You stayed."

"I stayed."

Noel smiled. It was soft. Real. "Good."

"Good," Eben echoed.

They lay there for a moment, neither moving, just—being.

"How's your wrist?" Eben asked.

"Sore. But okay."

"You need to ice it today."

"I will."

"Noel."

"I will. I promise."

Eben studied him. "Okay."

"You don't believe me."

"I believe you believe you."

Noel laughed. "Fair."

Eben's phone buzzed. He checked it. Frowned.

"What?" Noel asked.

"The market. There's a problem."

"What kind of problem?"

"The kind where the main structure collapsed overnight and we need to rebuild it before tomorrow's event."

Noel sat up. "Seriously?"

"Seriously."

"Okay. Okay. We can handle this. We just need to—"

"We," Eben said quietly.

Noel looked at him. "What?"

"You said 'we.'"

"Yeah. We're a team."

"Yeah," Eben said. "We are."

They got ready quickly. Grabbed coffee. Headed to the market site.

And Eben thought: *Four days. We have four days to figure this out.*

He was going to make them count.
