## Chapter 03: The Care

Eben's hands were steady. They were always steady.

That was the thing about Eben Frost—he held everything together. Other people's crises, festival logistics, his own emotions.

Right now, he was holding Noel's wrist like it was the most important thing in the world.

The first aid room was small. A converted storage closet, really. Private. Or it was supposed to be.

Eben had already shrugged off his coat. His sweater followed. He pulled Noel's jacket off gently, careful of the injured wrist.

"What are you doing?" Noel asked.

"You're cold. Body warmth helps." Eben wrapped his coat around Noel's shoulders. "You're shivering."

"I'm fine."

"You're shivering and you just fell on ice. That's not fine."

Eben sat beside him, close enough that their shoulders touched. His hand found Noel's uninjured one and held it.

The door was cracked. Neither of them noticed.

"Does this hurt?" Eben asked, gently probing the swelling on Noel's wrist.

"A little."

"This?"

"No."

"Good." Eben wrapped the bandage carefully. Precisely. "You need to ice this. And rest it."

"I will."

"Noel."

"I will. After the event."

Eben's jaw tightened. "The event is covered. Hugh has it."

"But—"

"You're hurt. You need to rest."

"I'm fine."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. "You don't have to be fine."

Noel blinked. "What?"

"You don't have to be fine. Not with me."

The words hit like a punch to the chest.

Noel stared at him. "I don't—I don't know how to not be fine."

Eben's expression softened. "I know."

"I have to be useful. If I'm not useful, then—"

"Then what?"

Noel's throat felt tight. "Then why would anyone keep me around?"

The silence stretched.

Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's face. Gentle. Deliberate.

"That's not how this works," Eben said quietly.

"How what works?"

"Us. You don't have to earn this. You don't have to be useful. You just have to—be."

Noel's eyes were burning. "I don't know how to do that."

"Then I'll teach you."

Noel laughed. It sounded wet. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

In the doorway—just for a second—a flash of light.

A phone.

Eben's head snapped toward the door. The crack was still there. The light was gone.

"Was that—" Noel started.

"Yes."

Someone had taken a photo. Through the cracked door. Of them. Eben with his coat wrapped around Noel, his hand on Noel's face, their bodies close in a way that left nothing to imagination.

"Eben—"

"I saw them. I don't know who." Eben's jaw was tight. "They're gone."

Noel felt cold. Not from the ice rink. From the sudden awareness that whatever privacy they'd had was probably already circulating through Tinsel Town's group chats.

"What do we do?"

Eben looked at him. Then, deliberately, he finished wrapping the bandage. Checked it twice. Made sure it was secure.

"Nothing," Eben said finally. "We don't hide. We don't explain. We just—are."

"That's terrifying."

"I know."

Eben finished with the bandage and sat back. Looked at Noel.

"You're allowed to need help," Eben said. "You're allowed to be hurt. You're allowed to not be fine. And apparently—" his mouth quirked, dark humor surfacing— "we're also allowed to be gossip."

Noel laughed despite himself. "You're taking this well."

"I'm compartmentalizing. The panic will come later."

"Noted."

"Come on," Eben said, standing. "We're getting you cocoa."

"I should check on the event—"

"Hugh has it. Wes is helping. The town is fine. You are going to sit down, drink cocoa, and let yourself be taken care of. The fact that someone took a photo of us doesn't change any of that."

"Is that an order?"

"Yes."

Noel's brain short-circuited. "Okay."

Eben smiled. Actually smiled. "Good."

They left the first aid station together, Noel's wrist carefully bandaged, and Noel thought: *I could get used to this.*

Being cared for. Being allowed to not be fine.

Being with someone who didn't need him to be useful to be worth keeping.

The fact that someone had photographed them should probably bother him more.

It didn't.

If the whole town wanted to know that Eben Frost looked at Noel Merrick like he was something precious—well.

Let them look.
