## Chapter 03: The Care

Eben's hands were steady. They were always steady.

That was the thing about Eben Frost—he held everything together. Other people's crises, festival logistics, his own emotions.

Right now, he was holding Noel's wrist like it was the most important thing in the world.

"Does this hurt?" Eben asked, gently probing the swelling.

"A little."

"This?"

"No."

"Good." Eben wrapped the bandage carefully. Precisely. "You need to ice this. And rest it."

"I will."

"Noel."

"I will. After the event."

Eben's jaw tightened. "The event is covered. Hugh has it."

"But—"

"You're hurt. You need to rest."

"I'm fine."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. "You don't have to be fine."

Noel blinked. "What?"

"You don't have to be fine. Not with me."

The words hit like a punch to the chest.

Noel stared at him. "I don't—I don't know how to not be fine."

Eben's expression softened. "I know."

"I have to be useful. If I'm not useful, then—"

"Then what?"

Noel's throat felt tight. "Then why would anyone keep me around?"

The silence stretched.

Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's face. Gentle. Deliberate.

"That's not how this works," Eben said quietly.

"How what works?"

"Us. You don't have to earn this. You don't have to be useful. You just have to—be."

Noel's eyes were burning. "I don't know how to do that."

"Then I'll teach you."

Noel laughed. It sounded wet. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

Eben finished wrapping the bandage. Checked it twice. Made sure it was secure.

Then he sat back. Looked at Noel.

"You're allowed to need help," Eben said. "You're allowed to be hurt. You're allowed to not be fine."

"That's a lot of allowances."

"You deserve all of them."

Noel's chest felt too full. "Eben—"

"Come on," Eben said, standing. "We're getting you cocoa."

"I should check on the event—"

"Hugh has it. Wes is helping. The town is fine. You are going to sit down, drink cocoa, and let yourself be taken care of."

"Is that an order?"

"Yes."

Noel's brain short-circuited. "Okay."

Eben smiled. Actually smiled. "Good."

They left the first aid station together, Noel's wrist carefully bandaged, and Noel thought: *I could get used to this.*

Being cared for. Being allowed to not be fine.

Being with someone who didn't need him to be useful to be worth keeping.

It was terrifying.

It was also the best thing that had ever happened to him.
