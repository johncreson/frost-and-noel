## Chapter 01: Ice Rink Setup

Noel was fine. He was also on four hours of sleep, running on his third coffee, and pretty sure he'd forgotten to eat yesterday. But fine. Definitely fine.

The ice rink looked beautiful, at least. Lights strung around the perimeter. Hot cocoa station set up. Music playing softly through the speakers.

It was going to be a great event.

He just had to survive it first.

"You should rest."

Noel jumped. Eben had appeared at his elbow with his usual stealth.

"I'm fine."

"You've said that three times in the last hour."

"Because it's true."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. "When did you last eat?"

"I—" Noel paused. "Yesterday?"

"Noel."

"I've been busy."

"You're always busy."

"That's how events work."

Eben's jaw tightened. "After this event, you're resting."

"After this event, there's the market setup tomorrow."

"Noel."

"What?"

"You can't keep doing this."

"Doing what?"

"Running yourself into the ground."

Noel smiled. It felt brittle. "I'm fine."

Eben didn't look convinced. But he also didn't push. Just handed Noel a protein bar from his pocket.

"Eat."

"I don't—"

"Eat. Now."

Noel's brain short-circuited at the command in Eben's voice. He took the protein bar. Ate it.

Eben watched him the entire time.

"Better?" Noel asked.

"Marginally."

"I'll take it."

They stood there for a moment, surrounded by the chaos of event setup, and Noel thought: *He's worried about me.*

That was—new. Nice. Terrifying.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly.

"You're welcome."

Families started arriving. Kids in winter coats. Parents with cameras. The event was starting.

Noel took a breath. Put on his event coordinator smile.

"Let's do this," he said.

Eben caught his hand. Just for a second. A brief squeeze.

Then he let go, and they both got to work.

But Noel felt that touch for the rest of the morning.

---

The event was going well.

Kids skating. Families laughing. The hot cocoa station doing brisk business.

Noel was everywhere at once. Helping a kid tie their skates. Checking on the music. Making sure the cocoa didn't run out.

Being useful. That's what he did.

Eben watched from the side, expression unreadable.

Hugh appeared, covered in what looked like hot cocoa.

"How do you always end up covered in something?" Noel asked.

"It's a gift." Hugh grinned. "You look exhausted."

"I'm fine."

"You keep saying that."

"Because it's true."

Hugh looked at Eben. Eben looked at Hugh. Some kind of silent communication happened.

"What?" Noel asked.

"Nothing," they said in unison.

Noel didn't believe them.

But he also didn't have time to argue. A kid needed help learning to skate.

"Excuse me," Noel said, and headed onto the ice.

Behind him, Hugh said something to Eben that Noel couldn't hear.

Eben's expression went dark.

Then Noel was on the ice, helping a nervous kid find their balance, and he forgot about everything else.

This was why he did it. Moments like this. Kids learning something new. The joy on their faces when they finally got it.

He was so focused on the kid that he didn't notice his own balance slipping.

Not until it was too late.
