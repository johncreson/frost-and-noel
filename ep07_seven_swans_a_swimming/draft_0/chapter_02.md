## Chapter 02: The Fall

Noel hit the ice hard.

One second he was helping a kid find their balance. The next, his own balance was gone, and he was falling, and his wrist twisted wrong, and—

Pain. Sharp and immediate.

He landed on his side. The kid he'd been helping was fine—Noel had made sure of that, even while falling.

"Are you okay, mister?" The kid's voice, worried.

"Fine!" Noel said automatically. *Internal: I am not fine.*

His wrist was screaming. His hip hurt. His pride was somewhere on the ice, probably shattered.

"Noel."

He looked up. Eben was there. Just—there. Like he'd been waiting for this. Like he'd known it was coming.

"I'm fine," Noel said.

"Let me see."

"It's nothing—"

Eben's hand on his arm. Gentle but firm. "Let. Me. See."

Noel's breath caught at the command in Eben's voice.

He held out his wrist.

Eben examined it carefully. His touch was gentle. Professional. His expression was murder.

"Can you move it?" Eben asked.

Noel tried. Winced. "Yeah."

"Does this hurt?" Eben pressed lightly on the bone.

"No."

"This?"

"A little."

"Noel."

"Okay, yes. It hurts."

Eben's jaw tightened. "First aid station. Now."

"I need to—"

"Now."

Noel let himself be helped up. Let Eben guide him off the ice. Let himself be taken care of.

It felt strange. Unfamiliar. Like wearing someone else's clothes.

But also—nice. In a terrifying way.

Hugh appeared to take over the event. Wes materialized with ice. The town moved around them like a well-oiled machine.

Eben guided Noel to the first aid station, hand on his back the entire time.

"I'm fine," Noel said again.

"Stop saying that."

"But I am."

"You're hurt."

"It's just a wrist."

"It's your wrist. That makes it important."

Noel's chest felt tight. "Eben—"

"Sit."

Noel sat.

Eben knelt in front of him, first aid kit already open.

"This is going to sting," Eben said, cleaning the abrasion on Noel's palm.

It did sting. Noel didn't say anything.

Eben worked in silence. Focused. Precise. Gentle.

Like Noel was something fragile. Something that mattered.

Noel watched him and thought: *I'm in so much trouble.*

The good kind of trouble.

The kind that felt like coming home.
