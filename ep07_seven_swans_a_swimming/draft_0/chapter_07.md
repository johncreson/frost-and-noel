## Chapter 07: Hook Ending

The market structure had collapsed spectacularly.

Noel stood in front of the wreckage and thought: *Of course it did.*

"Well," Hugh said, appearing at his elbow. "This is bad."

"Thanks, Hugh. Very helpful."

"I try."

Eben was already on his phone, coordinating volunteers. Making lists. Solving problems.

Noel watched him and felt something settle in his chest.

They could do this. Together.

"Okay," Noel said, turning to Hugh. "We need to rebuild this by tomorrow. Can we do it?"

"With the whole town helping? Yeah. Probably."

"Probably?"

"I'm an optimist."

"You're a chaos agent."

"I contain multitudes."

Noel laughed despite himself.

Eben appeared, phone still to his ear. "Volunteers are on their way. We have until midnight to get this done."

"Midnight," Noel repeated.

"Midnight."

"Okay. Let's do this."

They worked through the day. The whole town showed up. Sam Rook with tools. Wes with food. Mayor Kringle with encouragement and absolutely no practical skills.

Noel and Eben coordinated everything. Moving in sync. Anticipating each other's needs.

It was beautiful. Exhausting. Perfect.

By the time the sun set, they'd made significant progress.

By the time midnight rolled around, the market was rebuilt.

Noel stood back, looking at their work, and felt—

Proud. That was the word. Proud.

"We did it," he said.

Eben appeared at his side. "We did."

"Thank you. For helping."

"Thank you for letting me."

They stood there in the quiet night, surrounded by the rebuilt market, and Noel thought: *This is what partnership looks like.*

Not just romance. Not just attraction. But actual partnership. Working together. Building something together.

"Come on," Eben said quietly. "Let's go home."

Home. Noel's apartment. Their space now.

"Yeah," Noel said. "Let's go home."

They walked back together, hand in hand, and Noel thought: *Four days. We have four days left.*

He was going to make every single one of them count.

Because this—whatever this was—it was real.

And Noel Merrick was done pretending otherwise.
