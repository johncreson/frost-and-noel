## Chapter 04: The Almost

The Garland Cup was quiet for a late afternoon.

Noel and Eben sat in a corner booth, cocoa warming their hands, the world moving around them at a comfortable distance.

Noel's wrist was bandaged. Visible. A reminder that he'd let himself be taken care of.

It felt strange. Good. Terrifying.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly. "For today."

"You don't have to thank me."

"I know. I want to."

Eben looked at him. "Okay."

They sat in comfortable silence. Noel watched the steam rise from his cocoa and tried to find the words for what he was feeling.

"I'm not good at this," he said finally.

"At what?"

"Receiving help. Being taken care of. Admitting I need—"

He stopped. The word caught.

Eben waited. Didn't push. Just sat there with his hands wrapped around his own mug, patient as a saint.

"I need—" Noel tried again.

The sentence hung there. Unfinished.

*Need* was dangerous. *Need* was admission. *Need* was vulnerability in a way that Noel didn't know how to handle.

He couldn't finish it. Not yet.

Eben's hand covered his. Gentle. Deliberate.

"It's okay," Eben said quietly. "You don't have to finish that sentence right now."

"But I—"

"When you're ready. I'll be here."

Noel's throat felt tight. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They sat there, hands touching across the table, and Noel thought: *I'm falling in love with him.*

That was terrifying.

That was also the most real thing he'd ever felt.

"Come on," Eben said finally. "Let's get you home."

"Okay."

They left the café together, and Noel thought about the unfinished sentence.

*I need you.*

That's what he'd been trying to say.

Someday, he'd be brave enough to finish it.

Just not today.
