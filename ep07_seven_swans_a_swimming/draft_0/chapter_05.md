## Chapter 05: The Request

They stood at Noel's door.

Neither of them had suggested goodbye. They'd walked from the café in comfortable silence, and now they were here, and Noel didn't want Eben to leave.

He also didn't know how to ask him to stay.

"Thank you," Noel said. "For everything today."

"You're welcome."

They stood there. The hallway was quiet. The moment stretched.

"You could stay," Noel said quietly.

Eben's breath caught. "What?"

"You could stay. If you want. You don't have to. But—" Noel's courage faltered. "You could."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him.

"I want," Eben said.

Not "I want to." Just "I want."

That was its own confession.

Noel's heart was pounding. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

Noel unlocked the door. They went inside together.

It felt different this time. Not desperate. Not uncertain. This was—deliberate. Real.

"I should—" Noel gestured vaguely at his apartment. "I don't know. Make it presentable?"

"It's fine."

"I wasn't expecting—"

"Noel." Eben stepped closer. "It's fine. You're fine. We're fine."

Noel laughed. It sounded shaky. "Okay."

"Okay."

They stood there in Noel's small apartment, and Noel thought: *This is happening. This is real.*

"I've never—" Noel started. "I mean, I've had people stay over. But not like this. Not—"

"Not what?"

"Not someone I—" He stopped. Took a breath. "Not someone who matters."

Eben's expression softened. "You matter too."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

Eben pulled him close. Kissed him.

It was soft. Gentle. The kind of kiss that said *I'm here* instead of *this is temporary.*

When they pulled apart, Noel was breathless.

"Bed?" Eben asked quietly.

"Yeah. Okay. Yes."

They got ready for bed in comfortable silence. Noel lent Eben a shirt. They brushed their teeth side by side like they'd done this a hundred times.

It felt normal. Easy. Right.

When they finally climbed into bed, Noel didn't know what to expect.

Eben pulled him close. Wrapped an arm around him. Pressed a kiss to his temple.

"Sleep," Eben said quietly.

"That's it?"

"That's it. Unless you want—"

"No. This is—" Noel's voice went soft. "This is perfect."

They lay there in the dark, holding each other, and Noel thought: *This is what I've been missing.*

Not sex. Not performance. Just—this. Being held. Being safe. Being with someone who didn't need him to be anything other than himself.

"Eben?" Noel whispered.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For staying."

"Thank you for asking."

Noel closed his eyes and let himself be held.

For the first time in years, he felt safe enough to actually sleep.
