# EP07 Encoding Fix & EP9 Continuity Note

## Encoding Fix Applied ✅

Ran `fix_encoding.py` on all 7 rev_1 chapters to correct:
- Em dash encoding errors (`â€"` → `—`)
- Café encoding errors (`cafÃ©` → `café`)

Backups created for all chapters before fixes.

## EP9 Continuity Flag 🚩

**Line to watch in Chapter 6:**
> "I'm not interested in hiding."

**Context:** Eben says this about being public with Noel.

**EP9 Requirement:**
When Eben freezes in EP9, ensure it's framed as:
- Fear of **public permanence** (commitment), NOT secrecy
- Fear of being **locked in**, NOT being seen

**Why this matters:**
Otherwise readers may feel whiplash between "not hiding" (EP7) and pulling back (EP9).

**Solution for EP9:**
Eben's internal monologue should clarify:
- He's fine being seen as a couple
- He's terrified of the town expecting him to **stay**
- The photo makes it feel like a promise he can't keep
