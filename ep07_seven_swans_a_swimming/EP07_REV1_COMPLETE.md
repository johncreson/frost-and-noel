## Chapter 1: Ice Rink Setup

**NOEL**

Noel was fine.

He was also on four hours of sleep, running on his third coffee, and pretty sure he'd forgotten to eat yesterday. But fine. Definitely fine.

The ice rink looked beautiful, at least. Lights strung around the perimeter like frozen stars. Hot cocoa station set up with Hugh's signature excessive enthusiasm. Music playing softly through the speakersâ€”something instrumental and wintery that made the whole scene feel like a snow globe.

It was going to be a great event.

He just had to survive it first.

"You should rest."

Noel jumped. Eben had appeared at his elbow with his usual stealth, clipboard in hand, expression unreadable.

"I'm good," Noel said, forcing brightness into his voice.

"You've said that three times in the last hour."

"Because it's true."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him, the way he did when he was cataloging problems to solve. "When did you last eat?"

"Iâ€”" Noel paused, genuinely trying to remember. "Yesterday?"

"Noel."

"I've been busy."

"You're always busy." Eben's jaw tightened in that way that meant he was holding back something stronger. "After this event, you're resting."

"After this event, there's the market setup tomorrow."

"Noel."

"What?"

"You can't keep doing this."

"Doing what?"

"Running yourself into the ground." Eben's voice went quiet. Dangerous. "For people who would understand if you slowed down."

Noel smiled. It felt brittle on his face, like ice about to crack. "But I'mâ€”"

He stopped himself before saying it again. Eben was watching him too closely.

Eben didn't look convinced. But he also didn't push. Just reached into his coat pocket and produced a protein bar.

"Eat."

"I don'tâ€”"

"Eat. Now."

The command in Eben's voice did something to Noel's brain. Short-circuited it completely. He took the protein bar. Unwrapped it. Ate it while Eben watched him the entire time with those steady, assessing eyes.

"Better?" Noel asked when he'd finished.

"Marginally."

"I'll take it."

They stood there for a moment, surrounded by the chaos of event setupâ€”volunteers stringing lights, families starting to arrive, Hugh doing something with tinsel that would probably end in disasterâ€”and Noel thought: *He's worried about me.*

That was new. Nice. Terrifying.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly.

"You're welcome."

Families started arriving in earnest. Kids in winter coats, faces bright with excitement. Parents with cameras ready to capture every moment. The event was starting.

Noel took a breath. Put on his event coordinator smileâ€”the one that said everything was under control even when it absolutely wasn't.

"Let's do this," he said.

Eben caught his hand. Just for a second. A brief squeeze that said *I'm here* without words.

Then he let go, and they both got to work.

But Noel felt that touch for the rest of the morning. A warm point of contact in the cold.

---

**EBEN**

The event was going well.

Kids skating in wobbly circles. Families laughing. The hot cocoa station doing brisk business, steam rising into the cold air.

Noel was everywhere at once. Helping a kid tie their skates. Checking on the music. Making sure the cocoa didn't run out. Smiling at everyone, that bright, brittle smile that Eben was learning to read.

Being useful. That's what Noel did. What he thought he had to do.

Eben watched from the side, tracking Noel's movements, cataloging the exhaustion in the set of his shoulders, the way he was moving just a fraction slower than usual.

Hugh appeared, covered in what looked like hot cocoa and possibly glitter.

"How do you always end up covered in something?" Noel asked, laughing.

"It's a gift." Hugh grinned, then his expression shifted, going serious. "You look exhausted."

Noel's smile didn't waver. "I'm good."

"You keep saying that."

"Because it's true."

Hugh looked past Noel to Eben. Eben looked back. Some kind of silent communication happenedâ€”Hugh's eyebrows raising in question, Eben's slight nod in acknowledgment.

*I'm watching him. I know.*

"What?" Noel asked, glancing between them.

"Nothing," they said in unison.

Noel didn't believe them. Eben could see it in the way his eyes narrowed. But he also didn't have time to argue. A kid was waving at him from the ice, needing help.

"Excuse me," Noel said, and headed onto the ice.

Behind him, Hugh leaned in close. "He's going to collapse if he keeps this up."

"I know."

"You going to do something about it?"

"I'm trying." Eben's hands tightened on his clipboard. "He doesn't make it easy."

"He doesn't know how to accept help. Never has." Hugh's expression went soft. "But he's trying. With you. I can see it."

Eben watched Noel on the ice, crouched down beside a nervous kid, patient and gentle, completely focused on making this child feel safe.

That's who Noel was. He gave everything to everyone else and kept nothing for himself.

Eben's chest felt too tight.

Then Noel was moving, helping the kid find their balance, and Eben saw it happen in slow motion.

Noel's attention was entirely on the child. He didn't notice his own skate catching. Didn't notice his balance shifting wrong.

Not until it was too late.

Noel went down hard, twisting to protect the kid even as he fell.

Eben was already moving.
## Chapter 2: The Fall

**NOEL**

Noel hit the ice hard.

One second he was helping a kid find their balance, making sure small hands were steady on small skates. The next, his own balance was goneâ€”his skate caught on something, his body twisted wrong to keep the kid safeâ€”and he was falling.

His wrist took the impact. Sharp, immediate pain that made his vision white out for a second.

He landed on his side, breath knocked out of him, ice cold against his cheek.

The kid he'd been helping was fineâ€”Noel had made sure of that, even while falling. That's what mattered.

"Are you okay, mister?" The kid's voice, worried and small.

"I'm good!" Noel said automatically, even as his wrist screamed at him. *Internal monologue: I am absolutely not good. This is bad. This is very bad.*

His wrist was on fire. His hip hurt. His pride was somewhere on the ice, probably shattered into a thousand pieces along with his dignity.

"Noel."

He looked up. Eben was there. Justâ€”there. Like he'd materialized out of thin air, like he'd been waiting for this exact moment.

Like he'd known it was coming.

"I'mâ€”" Noel started, then stopped. Eben's expression was murder. Controlled, precise murder. "My wrist hurts."

"Let me see."

"It's probably nothingâ€”"

Eben's hand on his arm. Gentle but absolutely firm. "Let. Me. See."

The command in Eben's voice did that thing again. Made Noel's brain go quiet and obedient in a way that should probably concern him but mostly just felt like relief.

He held out his wrist.

Eben knelt on the ice beside him, careful and deliberate. His touch was gentle as he examined the injury. Professional. Precise. His expression was still murder.

"Can you move it?" Eben asked, voice steady.

Noel tried. Winced hard. "Yeah. Ow. Yes."

"Does this hurt?" Eben pressed lightly on the bone.

"No."

"This?"

"A little."

"Noel."

"Okay, yes. It hurts. It hurts a lot."

Eben's jaw tightened. Something dangerous flickered in his eyes. "First aid station. Now."

"I need to check on the eventâ€”"

"Now."

There was no room for argument in that single word. Noel let himself be helped up, let Eben guide him off the ice with a hand on his back, steady and warm even through his jacket.

Let himself be taken care of.

It felt strange. Unfamiliar. Like wearing someone else's clothes, like speaking a language he'd never learned.

But alsoâ€”nice. In a terrifying, vulnerable, completely overwhelming way.

---

**EBEN**

Eben had seen it happen.

Had watched Noel's attention focus entirely on the child, watched him not notice his own skate catching, watched the fall happen in slow motion while Eben was too far away to stop it.

Had watched Noel twist mid-fall to protect the kid, taking the full impact himself.

Of course he had. That's who Noel was.

Now Eben was guiding him off the ice, hand on his back, trying to keep his expression neutral when what he really wanted to do was wrap Noel in bubble wrap and lock him somewhere safe.

Hugh appeared to take over the event. Wes materialized with ice wrapped in a clean towel. The town moved around them like a well-oiled machine, everyone stepping up because they knew Noel needed them to.

Because they loved him.

Eben guided Noel to the first aid stationâ€”a converted storage closet that was private and warm and far enough from the chaos.

"Sit," Eben said.

Noel sat.

Eben knelt in front of him, first aid kit already open, and let himself take a breath. Let himself look at Noelâ€”really look at him.

Pale. Shaking slightly. Trying so hard to smile through the pain.

"This is going to sting," Eben said, cleaning the abrasion on Noel's palm where he'd caught himself.

It did sting. Noel didn't make a sound, just bit his lip and looked away.

Eben worked in silence. Focused. Precise. Gentle.

Like Noel was something fragile. Something precious. Something that mattered more than anything else in this entire town.

Because he was.

Noel watched him with those bright, vulnerable eyes, and Eben thought: *I'm in so much trouble.*

The good kind of trouble.

The kind that felt like coming home.

"You're hurt," Eben said quietly, wrapping the bandage. "You're allowed to be hurt."

"I know," Noel said. But his voice said he didn't know. Not really.

"Do you?"

Noel looked away. "I'm trying to."

"That's enough," Eben said. "Trying is enough."

He finished the bandage. Checked it twice. Made sure it was secure.

Then he looked up and found Noel watching him with an expression that made Eben's chest feel too full.

"Thank you," Noel whispered.

"Always," Eben said.

And meant it.
## Chapter 3: The Care

**EBEN**

Eben's hands were steady. They were always steady.

That was the thing about Eben Frostâ€”he held everything together. Other people's crises, festival logistics, his own carefully controlled emotions.

Right now, he was holding Noel's wrist like it was the most important thing in the world.

Because it was.

The first aid room was small. A converted storage closet, really, with a narrow bench and shelves of supplies. Private. Or it was supposed to be.

The door didn't close all the way. There was a crack. Neither of them noticed.

Eben had already shrugged off his coat. His sweater followedâ€”the thick wool one that Noel had once said made him look like a very attractive lumberjack. He pulled Noel's jacket off gently, careful of the injured wrist, and wrapped his own coat around Noel's shoulders.

"What are you doing?" Noel asked, voice small.

"You're cold. Body warmth helps." Eben sat beside him on the narrow bench, close enough that their shoulders touched, their thighs pressed together. "You're shivering."

"I didn't notice."

"I noticed."

Eben took Noel's uninjured hand and held it between both of his, warming it. The injured wrist he examined with careful, gentle touches, probing the swelling, checking for breaks.

In the doorwayâ€”just a crack of spaceâ€”light shifted. Neither of them saw it.

"Does this hurt?" Eben asked, fingers gentle on Noel's wrist.

"A little."

"This?"

"No."

"Good." Eben wrapped the bandage carefully. Precisely. Each layer deliberate. "You need to ice this. And rest it. No arguing."

"I will."

"Noel."

"I will. After the event."

Eben's jaw tightened. He finished the bandage, then looked up at Noel. Really looked at him. "The event is covered. Hugh has it. Wes is helping. The town is handling it."

"Butâ€”"

"You're hurt. You need to rest."

Noel's smile was automatic. Brittle. "I'mâ€”"

"Don't," Eben said quietly. "Don't say you're fine."

Noel stopped. Blinked. "What?"

"You don't have to be fine." Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's face, thumb brushing his cheekbone. "Not with me. You don't have to be fine."

The words hit like a physical blow. Noel stared at him, eyes wide and vulnerable.

"I don'tâ€”I don't know how to not be fine," Noel whispered.

"I know." Eben's voice went soft. Gentle. "I know you don't."

"I have to be useful. If I'm not useful, thenâ€”" Noel's voice cracked. "Then why would anyone keep me around?"

The silence stretched. Eben's thumb traced Noel's cheekbone, slow and deliberate.

"That's not how this works," Eben said quietly.

"How what works?"

"Us." Eben leaned closer, their foreheads almost touching. "You don't have to earn this. You don't have to be useful. You just have to be. Justâ€”be here. With me. That's enough."

Noel's eyes were burning. "I don't know how to do that."

"Then I'll teach you." Eben's voice was steady. Sure. "I'll teach you how to let yourself be cared for. How to accept help. How to believe you're worth keeping even when you're hurt."

Noel laughed. It sounded wet. Broken. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

In the doorwayâ€”just for a secondâ€”a flash of light. Bright and sudden.

A phone camera.

Eben's head snapped toward the door. The crack was still there. The light was gone. A shadow disappearing down the hallway.

"Was thatâ€”" Noel started, voice sharp with sudden awareness.

"Yes." Eben's voice went flat. Cold. "Someone took a photo."

Someone had photographed them. Through the cracked door. Eben with his coat wrapped around Noel, his hand on Noel's face, their bodies close and intimate in a way that left absolutely nothing to imagination.

"Ebenâ€”" Noel's voice was panicked.

"I saw them. I don't know who." Eben's jaw was tight, anger simmering under his skin. "They're gone now."

Noel felt cold. Not from the ice rink. From the sudden, visceral awareness that whatever privacy they'd had was probably already circulating through Tinsel Town's group chats. That photo would be everywhere by dinner.

"What do we do?"

Eben looked at him. Then, deliberately, he finished checking the bandage. Adjusted it. Made sure it was secure. Took his time.

"Nothing," Eben said finally. "We don't hide. We don't explain. We don't apologize for what they saw."

"That's terrifying."

"I know." Eben's hand found Noel's again. Squeezed. "But I meant what I said. You don't have to earn this. And I'm not going to pretend we're something we're not just because someone took a picture."

"What are we?"

"Real," Eben said simply. "We're real."

---

**NOEL**

Noel sat there, Eben's coat warm around his shoulders, Eben's hand solid in his, and tried to process what had just happened.

Someone had photographed them. In a private moment. Eben taking care of him, touching his face, looking at him like he was something precious.

The whole town would see it.

The whole town would know.

And Eben was saying they should do nothing. Justâ€”be.

"You're allowed to need help," Eben said, still holding his hand. "You're allowed to be hurt. You're allowed to not be fine. And apparentlyâ€”" his mouth quirked, dark humor surfacingâ€” "we're also allowed to be gossip."

Noel laughed despite himself. Despite everything. "You're taking this well."

"I'm compartmentalizing. The panic will come later."

"Noted."

"Come on," Eben said, standing and pulling Noel up with him. "We're getting you cocoa."

"I should check on the eventâ€”"

"Hugh has it. Wes is helping. The town is fine." Eben's voice went firm. "You are going to sit down, drink cocoa, and let yourself be taken care of. The fact that someone took a photo of us doesn't change any of that."

"Is that an order?"

"Yes."

Noel's brain short-circuited again. "Okay."

Eben smiled. Actually smiled, small and genuine. "Good."

They left the first aid station together, Noel's wrist carefully bandaged, and Noel thought: *I could get used to this.*

Being cared for. Being allowed to not be fine. Being allowed to need someone.

Being with someone who didn't need him to be useful to be worth keeping.

The fact that someone had photographed them should probably bother him more.

It didn't.

If the whole town wanted to know that Eben Frost looked at Noel Merrick like he was something preciousâ€”well.

Let them look.

Let them see what real looked like.
## Chapter 4: The Almost

**NOEL**

The Garland Cup was not quiet.

Noel and Eben walked in and immediately felt the shift. The cafÃ© wasn't just busyâ€”it was *aware*. Hyperaware. The kind of awareness that came from fresh gossip and new information.

Heads turned. Phones were quickly pocketedâ€”but not before Noel saw the screens, saw the photo, saw himself and Eben in that intimate moment that was supposed to be private.

Conversations went silent and then resumed at lower volumes, clearly about something very specific.

About them.

*Well. That was fast.*

Wes appeared at the counter, expression carefully neutral in a way that meant the exact opposite of neutral. His eyes were bright with knowledge and something that looked like approval.

"Noel. Eben. Coffee? Cocoa? A protective barrier from the gossip mill?"

"Cocoa," Noel said, holding up his bandaged wrist. "For medicinal purposes."

"Saw the photo," Wes said quietly, leaning across the counter. "You two look cozy. Very tender. The town is having feelings about it."

Noel's stomach dropped. "It's alreadyâ€”"

"Everywhere. Mrs. Henderson shared it in the community group chat approximately thirty seconds after whoever took it posted it to their personal feed. It's been shared forty-seven times in the last twenty minutes." Wes's mouth twitched. "I'm tracking it. For science."

"Great. That's great."

"You look good, though. Both of you. Eben looking at you like you're made of glass and he's terrified you'll break. You looking at him like he's the first person who's ever actually seen you." Wes's voice went soft. "It's sweet. People are happy for you."

Eben's expression had gone carefully blank. "Two cocoas. Corner booth. Minimal interruption."

"On it, boss."

They retreated to the corner booth. Noel slid in first; Eben took the seat across from him, positioning himself with a clear view of the door.

*Guarding,* Noel realized. *He's still guarding me. Even here.*

Wes brought the cocoas. Set them down with a flourish. Lingered.

"For what it's worth," Wes said, voice low enough that only they could hear, "most people are genuinely happy for you. The photo's not scandalousâ€”it's sweet. Intimate, yeah. But sweet. Eben looking at you like you're precious. You letting yourself be cared for." He paused. "That's not something this town has seen from you before, Noel. They're glad you found someone who makes you feel safe enough to let your guard down."

"Sweet," Eben repeated flatly.

"Sweet. Tender. Romantic. Pick your adjective." Wes grinned. "Now drink your cocoa and stop looking like you're about to be executed for the crime of being in love."

He left before either of them could respond to that.

Noel wrapped his hands around his mug, trying to find the words. The cafÃ© hummed around themâ€”conversations, laughter, the hiss of the espresso machine. Normal sounds. But underneath it all, the awareness. The watching.

"I'm sorry," Noel said finally.

Eben looked up sharply. "For what?"

"Forâ€”" Noel gestured vaguely at the cafÃ©, at the people trying not to stare, at the phones in pockets. "This. The photo. The gossip. I know you're private. I know you didn't sign up for the whole town knowing our business."

"Noel."

"I can talk to whoever took it. Ask them to take it down. Maybe if weâ€”"

"Noel." Eben's voice was firm. Final. "Look at me."

Noel looked.

Eben's expression had softened. His eyes were steady, certain. "I'm not sorry."

"You're not?"

"No. I'm annoyed that someone invaded our privacy. I'm angry that they took something private and made it public without asking." His jaw tightened. "But I'm not sorry that they saw what they saw."

"What did they see?"

Eben leaned forward, voice dropping low. "Me. Taking care of you. The way I want to. The way you deserve." He paused. "The way I'm going to keep doing, whether there's a camera or not."

Noel's breath caught.

"I meant what I said," Eben continued quietly. "We don't hide. We don't explain. We don't apologize. We just are. If the town wants to take pictures of thatâ€”" He shrugged. "Let them."

"You're serious."

"I'm serious."

They sat in silence, but it was different now. Not uncomfortable. Not heavy. Justâ€”present. Real.

Noel watched the steam rise from his cocoa, watched the way the light caught in it, and tried to find the words for what he was feeling.

Around them, the cafÃ© continued its quiet observation. Glances. Whispers. The low hum of a town that had just received confirmation of what it had suspected for days.

"I'm not good at this," Noel said finally.

"At what?"

"Receiving help. Being taken care of. Admitting Iâ€”" He stopped. The word caught in his throat like a physical thing.

Eben waited. Didn't push. Just sat there with his hands wrapped around his own mug, patient as a saint, steady as stone.

"I needâ€”" Noel tried again.

The sentence hung there. Unfinished. Incomplete.

*Need* was dangerous. *Need* was admission. *Need* was vulnerability in a way that Noel didn't know how to handle, didn't know how to voice, didn't know how to survive.

He couldn't finish it. Not yet. Not here, with the whole town watching, with his heart in his throat and his wrist still aching and everything feeling too big, too real, too much.

Eben's hand covered his across the table. Gentle. Deliberate. Warm.

"It's okay," Eben said quietly. "You don't have to finish that sentence right now."

"But Iâ€”"

"When you're ready. I'll be here." Eben's thumb traced across Noel's knuckles. "I'm not going anywhere."

Noel's throat felt tight. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They sat there, hands touching across the table, surrounded by gossip and warmth and the smell of cocoa and cinnamon, and Noel thought: *I'm falling in love with him.*

That was terrifying.

That was also the most real thing he'd ever felt.

---

**EBEN**

Eben watched Noel struggle with the unfinished sentence and knew exactly what he'd been trying to say.

*I need you.*

That's what Noel had been trying to voice. What he wasn't ready to admit yet, not out loud, not in public, maybe not even to himself.

But Eben knew.

He could see it in the way Noel's eyes went wide and vulnerable. In the way his breath caught. In the way he looked at Eben like he was both terrified and hopeful at the same time.

Eben could wait. He was good at waiting. Good at being patient. Good at giving people the time and space they needed to come to him.

He'd wait as long as Noel needed.

"Come on," Eben said finally, when the silence had stretched long enough. "Let's get you home."

"Okay."

They left the cafÃ© together, and Eben felt the weight of eyes on them. The town watching. Judging. Approving.

He didn't care.

All he cared about was the man beside him, walking close enough that their shoulders brushed, trusting Eben enough to let himself be seen.

That was enough.

For now, that was more than enough.
## Chapter 5: The Request

**NOEL**

They stood at Noel's door.

Neither of them had suggested goodbye. They'd walked from the cafÃ© in comfortable silence, shoulders brushing, hands occasionally touching, and now they were here in the quiet hallway, and Noel didn't want Eben to leave.

He also didn't know how to ask him to stay.

The hallway was dim. Quiet. Just the two of them and the weight of everything unsaid between them.

"Thank you," Noel said finally. "For everything today."

"You're welcome."

They stood there. The moment stretched. Eben made no move to leave, just stood there watching Noel with those steady, patient eyes.

Noel took a breath. Found his courage.

"You could stay," Noel said quietly. "If you want."

Eben's breath caught. Visible. Audible. "What?"

"You could stay. If you want. You don't have to. Butâ€”" Noel's courage faltered, but he pushed through. "You could. I want you to."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. Something shifted in his expressionâ€”surprise, want, something tender and careful.

"I want," Eben said.

Not "I want to." Just "I want."

Simple. Direct. Honest.

That was its own confession.

Noel's heart was pounding so hard he could feel it in his throat. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

Noel unlocked the door with shaking hands. They went inside together.

It felt different this time. Not desperate. Not uncertain. Not stolen or temporary or pretend.

This was deliberate. Real. A choice they were both making with open eyes.

"I shouldâ€”" Noel gestured vaguely at his apartment, suddenly aware of the dishes in the sink, the jacket thrown over the couch, the general chaos of his life on display. "I don't know. Make it presentable?"

"It's fine." Eben stepped closer, into Noel's space. "You're fine."

"I wasn't expecting companyâ€”"

"Noel." Eben's hand came up to cup his face, thumb brushing his cheekbone. "It's fine. You're fine. We're fine."

Noel laughed. It sounded shaky. Breathless. "Okay."

"Okay."

They stood there in Noel's small apartmentâ€”the space that was entirely his, that he'd never really let anyone into, not like thisâ€”and Noel thought: *This is happening. This is real.*

"I've neverâ€”" Noel started, then stopped. Started again. "I mean, I've had people stay over. But not like this. Notâ€”"

"Not what?"

"Not someone Iâ€”" He stopped. Took a breath. Found the words. "Not someone who matters."

Eben's expression softened. Went tender. "You matter too."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." Eben pulled him close. Kissed him.

It was soft. Gentle. The kind of kiss that said *I'm here* instead of *this is temporary.* The kind of kiss that felt like a promise.

When they pulled apart, Noel was breathless.

"Bed?" Eben asked quietly.

"Yeah. Okay. Yes."

---

**EBEN**

They got ready for bed in comfortable silence.

Eben watched Noel move through his spaceâ€”the small apartment that was so clearly his, full of festival schedules and coffee mugs and the organized chaos of someone who gave everything to everyone else.

Noel lent him a shirt. It was soft, worn, smelled like Noel's laundry detergent.

They brushed their teeth side by side at the small bathroom sink, shoulders touching, meeting each other's eyes in the mirror.

It felt normal. Easy. Right.

Like they'd done this a hundred times before.

Like they'd do it a hundred times more.

When they finally climbed into bed, Eben didn't know what to expect. Didn't know what Noel wanted, what he needed, what this meant.

But then Noel curled into him, fitting against his side like he belonged there, and Eben pulled him close. Wrapped an arm around him. Pressed a kiss to his temple.

"Sleep," Eben said quietly.

"That's it?" Noel's voice was soft. Uncertain.

"That's it. Unless you wantâ€”"

"No. This isâ€”" Noel's voice went softer. Vulnerable. "This is perfect."

They lay there in the dark, holding each other, and Eben thought: *This is what I've been missing.*

Not sex. Not performance. Not temporary arrangements or careful boundaries.

Just this. Being held. Being safe. Being with someone who didn't need him to be anything other than himself.

"Eben?" Noel whispered.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For staying."

"Thank you for asking." Eben tightened his arm around Noel. "I've been waiting for you to ask."

Noel made a small sound. Pressed closer.

Eben closed his eyes and let himself have this. Let himself hold Noel. Let himself believe, just for tonight, that this could be more than temporary.

That this could be real.

---

**NOEL**

Noel lay in the dark, wrapped in Eben's arms, and felt something settle in his chest.

Safe. That's what this was.

For the first time in yearsâ€”maybe everâ€”he felt safe enough to actually sleep. Safe enough to let his guard down. Safe enough to need someone and not be terrified they'd leave.

Eben's breathing was steady against his hair. His arm was solid around Noel's waist. His presence was warm and real and here.

"I'm glad you stayed," Noel whispered into the darkness.

"I'm glad you asked," Eben whispered back.

Noel closed his eyes and let himself be held.

Let himself believe this was real.

Let himself fall asleep in the arms of someone who looked at him like he was precious, who took care of him without needing him to earn it, who stayed when Noel asked instead of finding reasons to leave.

For the first time in a very long time, Noel Merrick felt like he might actually be worth keeping.

And that was terrifying.

And that was also the most beautiful thing he'd ever felt.
## Chapter 6: Morning Light

**EBEN**

Eben woke up to sunlight and the weight of Noel's head on his chest.

For a moment, he just lay there, not moving, trying to memorize the feeling.

This was different. This was trust.

Noel was still asleep, breathing slow and even against Eben's skin. His bandaged wrist was visible on top of the blanket, a reminder of yesterday's fall, of Eben catching him, of the photo that was probably still circulating through the town's group chats.

Noel's face was relaxed in a way Eben had never seen while he was awake. Peaceful. Safe. Like he'd finally let himself stop performing, stop being useful, stop being fine.

Like he'd finally let himself just be.

Eben's chest felt too full.

*I could get used to this,* he thought. *I shouldn't. But I could.*

Four days. They had four days left of the festival.

And then what?

Eben had a job. A life. Commitments that existed outside of Tinsel Town, contracts waiting for him in other cities, other projects that needed his expertise.

But he also had this. Noel. The possibility of something more than temporary.

He didn't know how to make it work.

He just knew he wanted to try.

Noel stirred. Blinked awake slowly, like he was surfacing from deep water. Looked up at Eben with sleepy, vulnerable eyes.

"Morning," Noel mumbled, voice rough with sleep.

"Morning."

"You stayed." There was wonder in Noel's voice. Like he'd half-expected to wake up alone.

"I stayed."

Noel smiled. It was soft. Real. Unguarded. "Good."

"Good," Eben echoed.

They lay there for a moment, neither moving, just being. The morning light filtered through Noel's curtains, painting everything gold. Outside, the town was waking upâ€”distant sounds of traffic, voices, life continuing.

But in here, it was just them.

"How's your wrist?" Eben asked quietly.

"Sore. But okay."

"You need to ice it today. And rest it."

"I will."

"Noel."

"I will. I promise." Noel shifted, propping himself up on his good elbow to look at Eben properly. "I'm trying. To let myself be taken care of. It's justâ€”new."

"I know." Eben reached up, brushed a strand of hair from Noel's forehead. "You're doing well."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

Noel's smile went brighter. That praise-seeking look that Eben was learning to recognize, learning to give what Noel needed.

"Good," Noel said softly.

They stayed in bed longer than they should have. Talking quietly. Touching gently. Learning the shape of each other in morning light instead of darkness.

This was intimacy. Real intimacy. Not performance, not temporary, not stolen moments between festival crises.

This was choosing each other. In daylight. With open eyes.

**NOEL**

Noel made coffee while Eben showered.

It felt domestic. Normal. Like they'd done this a hundred times before instead of this being the first morning-after they'd ever had.

He could hear the water running, could imagine Eben in his shower, using his soap, existing in his space like he belonged there.

The thought made Noel's chest feel warm.

His phone buzzed. Multiple times. He picked it up, saw the notifications.

The photo from yesterday had spawned an entire conversation thread in the community group chat. Mrs. Henderson had shared it with commentary ("So sweet! Our boys!"). Wes had added a gif. Hugh had contributed chaos.

And underneath it all, genuine warmth. The town was happy for them.

Noel scrolled through the messages, feeling something settle in his chest. Not anxiety. Not fear.

Justâ€”acceptance. The town knew. The town saw. And the town was glad.

The shower turned off. A moment later, Eben emerged, hair damp, wearing yesterday's clothes, looking rumpled and real and here.

"Coffee?" Noel offered.

"Please."

They sat at Noel's small kitchen table, drinking coffee, and it felt like the most natural thing in the world.

"The photo's still making rounds," Noel said, showing Eben his phone.

Eben looked at it. His expression softened. "They're happy for us."

"Yeah." Noel set his phone down. "Is that weird? That I don't mind?"

"No." Eben reached across the table, took Noel's hand. "It's not weird. It's honest."

"I thought I'd be more freaked out. About everyone knowing."

"Are you freaked out?"

Noel considered. "No. I'mâ€”" He paused, searching for the word. "I'm okay with it. With them knowing. With this being real instead of secret."

"Good," Eben said quietly. "Because I'm not interested in hiding."

"No?"

"No." Eben's thumb traced across Noel's knuckles. "I'm interested in this. In you. In figuring out what comes after the festival ends."

Noel's breath caught. "After?"

"After." Eben's eyes were steady. Certain. "I have four days left in Tinsel Town. I want to spend them with you. And thenâ€”we figure out what comes next."

"You want there to be a next?"

"I want there to be a next." Eben squeezed his hand. "If you do."

Noel felt his eyes burning. "Yeah. I do."

"Then we'll figure it out."

They sat there, hands linked across the table, morning light streaming through the windows, and Noel thought: *This is real. This is actually real.*

Not temporary. Not pretend. Not performance.

Real.

**EBEN**

Eben's phone buzzed. He checked it, frowned.

"What?" Noel asked.

"Mayor Kringle. Wants to meet about tomorrow's market event." Eben read the message. "Says there's been a development."

"What kind of development?"

"Doesn't say. Just wants us at the town hall in an hour."

Noel sighed. "Back to work, then."

"Back to work." Eben stood, but didn't let go of Noel's hand. "But tonightâ€”"

"Tonight?"

"Stay with me tonight. At my hotel." Eben pulled Noel up, into his arms. "Let me take care of you properly. Dinner. Rest. No festival emergencies."

"You think we can avoid festival emergencies?"

"I can try." Eben kissed him, soft and sweet. "Say yes."

"Yes," Noel said against his mouth. "Yes."

They got ready together. Eben borrowed a clean shirt. Noel re-wrapped his wrist. They moved around each other easily, naturally, like they'd been doing this for years instead of hours.

Before they left, Eben caught Noel at the door. Pulled him close.

"Thank you," Eben said quietly. "For asking me to stay."

"Thank you for staying."

"Always," Eben said. "I'll always stay when you ask."

Noel's eyes went bright. "Promise?"

"Promise."

They left Noel's apartment together, walking close, shoulders brushing, and Eben thought: *Four days. We have four days to figure this out.*

He was going to make every single one of them count.

Because thisâ€”whatever this was between themâ€”it was real.

And Eben Frost was done pretending otherwise.
## Chapter 7: What Comes Next

**NOEL**

The town hall meeting was supposed to be routine.

Noel and Eben walked in together, still close from the morning, still warm from coffee and conversation and the promise of tonight.

Mayor Kringle was waiting for them, along with Hugh and a few other festival committee members. The mayor's expression wasâ€”complicated. Excited and nervous at the same time.

"Noel! Eben! Thank you for coming." Mayor Kringle gestured them to seats. "We have wonderful news."

"Wonderful news that required an emergency meeting?" Noel asked, settling into a chair. Eben stood behind him, hand resting on the back of Noel's chair. Possessive. Protective.

"The sponsor photos from yesterday's reception," Mayor Kringle said, pulling out his tablet. "They loved them. Loved you two. They want to feature Tinsel Town in their holiday campaign next year."

"That'sâ€”" Noel blinked. "That's amazing."

"It is! Butâ€”" Mayor Kringle's smile faltered. "They want to come back tomorrow. For the market event. To get more photos. More of the 'authentic small-town romance' they saw in you two."

Noel felt Eben's hand tighten on the chair.

"Tomorrow," Eben said flatly.

"Tomorrow! The holiday market is our biggest event. They want to capture it. The town, the people, theâ€”" Mayor Kringle gestured vaguely. "The love story."

"We're not a love story," Noel said automatically. Then stopped. "I meanâ€”we're not a performance."

"Of course not! But you are a couple. A real couple. And they want to feature that authenticity." Mayor Kringle leaned forward. "This could mean significant funding for next year's festival. But only if tomorrow goes perfectly."

Hugh spoke up from the corner. "No pressure or anything."

"What could go wrong?" Noel asked, feeling dread settle in his stomach.

Mayor Kringle's smile went nervous. "Well. About that. There's been a small issue with the market structure."

**EBEN**

Eben knew that tone.

That was the tone of someone about to deliver very bad news while trying to make it sound not-that-bad.

"Define 'small issue,'" Eben said.

"The main pavilion frame has some structural concerns," Mayor Kringle said carefully. "The inspector flagged it this morning. We need to reinforce it before tomorrow's event."

"How much reinforcement?"

"Significant reinforcement."

"How significant?"

Mayor Kringle winced. "We might need to rebuild sections of it."

"By tomorrow."

"By tomorrow."

Eben looked at Noel. Noel looked back at him. Some kind of silent communication happenedâ€”the kind they'd been developing over the past week, the kind that said *this is going to be a disaster* and *but we'll handle it together.*

"Okay," Noel said, standing. "We can do this. We just need to organize volunteers, get materials, coordinate the rebuild while keeping the rest of the festival runningâ€”"

"Noel," Eben said quietly.

Noel stopped. Looked at him.

"Your wrist," Eben said. "You're injured. You need to rest it."

"I can coordinate withoutâ€”"

"You need to rest." Eben's voice went firm. "I'll handle the market structure. You handle the sponsor coordination and the rest of the festival. We divide and conquer."

"Butâ€”"

"Noel." Eben stepped closer, hand finding Noel's good one. "Let me help. Let us work together. You don't have to do this alone."

Noel's expression softened. "Okay. Together."

"Together," Eben agreed.

Mayor Kringle beamed. "Wonderful! I knew you two would handle it. You're such a good team."

Hugh snorted from the corner. "They're something, all right."

---

**NOEL**

They left the town hall with a plan.

Eben would coordinate the structural rebuild with Sam Rook and the construction volunteers. Noel would handle the sponsor liaison, the vendor coordination, and the thousand other details that went into running a festival event.

They'd work through the afternoon and evening. Then tonightâ€”

"Tonight," Eben said as they stood outside the town hall, "you're still coming to my hotel."

"Even with all this?"

"Especially with all this." Eben pulled him close, right there on the town hall steps where anyone could see. "You need rest. You need food. You need someone to make sure you actually take care of yourself."

"Is that an order?"

"Yes."

Noel's brain did that thing again. "Okay."

Eben smiled. Kissed him, soft and quick. "Good. Now go coordinate your sponsors. I'll see you tonight."

"Tonight," Noel agreed.

They separated to handle their respective crises, and Noel thought: *This is what partnership looks like.*

Not just romance. Not just attraction. But actual partnership. Working together. Trusting each other. Dividing responsibilities and knowing the other person would handle their part.

His phone buzzed. Wes, texting: *Saw you two on the town hall steps. The photo is already circulating. You're killing the gossip mill with cuteness.*

Noel smiled. Texted back: *Good.*

Let them see. Let them know. Let them watch Noel Merrick finally let himself be cared for by someone who looked at him like he was precious.

He had work to do. Sponsors to coordinate. A festival to save.

But tonightâ€”tonight he'd let himself be taken care of.

Tonight he'd let himself believe this was real.

And maybe, just maybe, he'd find the courage to finish that sentence.

*I need you.*

Not today. But soon.

**EBEN**

Eben coordinated the market rebuild with the efficiency of someone who'd spent his entire career solving impossible problems on impossible timelines.

Sam Rook showed up with tools and expertise. Hugh appeared with volunteers and chaos. The town rallied, the way it always did, everyone stepping up because that's what Tinsel Town did.

But through it all, Eben kept thinking about tonight.

About Noel in his hotel room. About taking care of him properly. About the four days they had left and what came after.

He'd meant what he said this morning. He wanted there to be a next. Wanted to figure out how to make this work beyond the festival, beyond the temporary contract, beyond the twelve days of Christmas chaos.

He just had to convince Noel it was possible.

Had to convince Noel he was worth keeping. Worth staying for. Worth building something real with.

Eben thought he could do that.

He had four days.

He was going to make them count.

The market structure was coming together. The town was working. Tomorrow would be chaos, but they'd handle it.

Together.

That was the word that mattered.

Together.

Eben pulled out his phone, texted Noel: *Dinner at 7. My hotel. Don't be late.*

Noel's response came immediately: *Is that an order?*

Eben smiled. Typed: *Yes.*

Three dots. Then: *Good.*

Eben pocketed his phone and got back to work.

Four days left.

And then they'd figure out what came next.

Together.
