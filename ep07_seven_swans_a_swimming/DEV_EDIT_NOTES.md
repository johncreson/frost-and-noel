# EP07 Developmental Edit Notes
## Seven Swans a-Swimming / Seven Swans in Scandal

---

## PASS 1: PLOT & STRUCTURE

### ✅ Key Beats Present (per dossier)
- [x] Ice rink event setup (Ch1)
- [x] Noel overworking despite relationship (Ch1)
- [x] The Fall - Noel injures wrist (Ch2)
- [x] The Care - intimate caretaking scene (Ch3)
- [x] Photo scandal - someone photographs them (Ch3)
- [x] "You don't have to be fine" moment (Ch3)
- [x] Gossip confirmation at Garland Cup (Ch4)
- [x] "I need—" unfinished sentence (Ch4) ← IMPORTANT: Must complete in EP11
- [x] First overnight request (Ch5)
- [x] First overnight stay (Ch5)

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL ISSUES

**1. Ch6-7 Contains EP8 Plot**
The market collapse and overnight rebuild is the central conflict of EP8 per the dossier:
> "EP8: Holiday market collapses → They rebuild it together overnight"

**Recommendation:** Remove market collapse from Ch6-7. End EP07 with the morning-after intimacy and setup for EP8.

**2. Episode Title Mismatch**
- Folder: `ep07_seven_swans_a_swimming`
- Dossier: "Seven Swans in Scandal"

**Recommendation:** Align with dossier title which better reflects the photo scandal theme.

## PASS 2: CHARACTER & EMOTIONAL BEATS

### Noel's Wound Arc
**"I'm fine" count:** 8+ instances across Ch1-3
- Ch1: "I'm fine" x3
- Ch2: "Fine!" / "I'm fine" x2  
- Ch3: "I'm fine" x2

**Recommendation:** Reduce to 4-5 max. Each "I'm fine" should escalate tension, not become white noise.

### Eben's Caretaking
✅ Well-developed:
- Protein bar (Ch1)
- Commanding tone works
- Removing layers for warmth (Ch3)
- "You don't have to be fine" line lands

### The "I need—" Beat
**Location:** Ch4, lines 89-101
**Current execution:** Good. Sets up the payoff for EP11.
**Note:** Internal reveal at end of chapter ("I need you") slightly weakens the mystery.

**Recommendation:** Cut the internal reveal (lines 131-133). Let readers guess.

## PASS 3: PACING & COZY TEXTURES

### Missing Sensory Details
Per dossier cozy textures:
- Smell: ice, cocoa, cold air, skin ← Most present
- Tactile: wrapped wrist, warm drinks, body warmth ← Good
- Light: "rink lights, phone flash, Garland warmth" ← Phone flash moment needs more punch

### Dialogue Distinctiveness
- Eben speaks in short, command sentences ✅
- Noel deflects with "I'm fine" / questions ✅
- Wes has good voice ("cozy" observation) ✅
- Hugh needs more distinct chaos energy

## REVISION PRIORITIES

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. **Remove market collapse from Ch6-7** (belongs in EP8)
2. **End EP07 at morning-after** with EP8 teaser hook
3. **Reduce "I'm fine" count** to 4-5

### Important (Should Fix)
4. Add POV markers to chapter headers
5. Strengthen photo flash moment in Ch3
6. Cut internal "I need you" reveal at Ch4 end

### Optional (Nice to Have)
7. Add more scandal escalation between Ch4-5
8. Give Hugh more distinctive dialogue
9. Add more tactile sensory details in care scene
