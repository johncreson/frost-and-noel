## Chapter 4: The Almost

**NOEL**

The Garland Cup was not quiet.

Noel and Eben walked in and immediately felt the shift. The café wasn't just busy—it was *aware*. Hyperaware. The kind of awareness that came from fresh gossip and new information.

Heads turned. Phones were quickly pocketed—but not before Noel saw the screens, saw the photo, saw himself and Eben in that intimate moment that was supposed to be private.

Conversations went silent and then resumed at lower volumes, clearly about something very specific.

About them.

*Well. That was fast.*

Wes appeared at the counter, expression carefully neutral in a way that meant the exact opposite of neutral. His eyes were bright with knowledge and something that looked like approval.

"Noel. Eben. Coffee? Cocoa? A protective barrier from the gossip mill?"

"Cocoa," Noel said, holding up his bandaged wrist. "For medicinal purposes."

"Saw the photo," Wes said quietly, leaning across the counter. "You two look cozy. Very tender. The town is having feelings about it."

Noel's stomach dropped. "It's already—"

"Everywhere. Mrs. Henderson shared it in the community group chat approximately thirty seconds after whoever took it posted it to their personal feed. It's been shared forty-seven times in the last twenty minutes." Wes's mouth twitched. "I'm tracking it. For science."

"Great. That's great."

"You look good, though. Both of you. Eben looking at you like you're made of glass and he's terrified you'll break. You looking at him like he's the first person who's ever actually seen you." Wes's voice went soft. "It's sweet. People are happy for you."

Eben's expression had gone carefully blank. "Two cocoas. Corner booth. Minimal interruption."

"On it, boss."

They retreated to the corner booth. Noel slid in first; Eben took the seat across from him, positioning himself with a clear view of the door.

*Guarding,* Noel realized. *He's still guarding me. Even here.*

Wes brought the cocoas. Set them down with a flourish. Lingered.

"For what it's worth," Wes said, voice low enough that only they could hear, "most people are genuinely happy for you. The photo's not scandalous—it's sweet. Intimate, yeah. But sweet. Eben looking at you like you're precious. You letting yourself be cared for." He paused. "That's not something this town has seen from you before, Noel. They're glad you found someone who makes you feel safe enough to let your guard down."

"Sweet," Eben repeated flatly.

"Sweet. Tender. Romantic. Pick your adjective." Wes grinned. "Now drink your cocoa and stop looking like you're about to be executed for the crime of being in love."

He left before either of them could respond to that.

Noel wrapped his hands around his mug, trying to find the words. The café hummed around them—conversations, laughter, the hiss of the espresso machine. Normal sounds. But underneath it all, the awareness. The watching.

"I'm sorry," Noel said finally.

Eben looked up sharply. "For what?"

"For—" Noel gestured vaguely at the café, at the people trying not to stare, at the phones in pockets. "This. The photo. The gossip. I know you're private. I know you didn't sign up for the whole town knowing our business."

"Noel."

"I can talk to whoever took it. Ask them to take it down. Maybe if we—"

"Noel." Eben's voice was firm. Final. "Look at me."

Noel looked.

Eben's expression had softened. His eyes were steady, certain. "I'm not sorry."

"You're not?"

"No. I'm annoyed that someone invaded our privacy. I'm angry that they took something private and made it public without asking." His jaw tightened. "But I'm not sorry that they saw what they saw."

"What did they see?"

Eben leaned forward, voice dropping low. "Me. Taking care of you. The way I want to. The way you deserve." He paused. "The way I'm going to keep doing, whether there's a camera or not."

Noel's breath caught.

"I meant what I said," Eben continued quietly. "We don't hide. We don't explain. We don't apologize. We just are. If the town wants to take pictures of that—" He shrugged. "Let them."

"You're serious."

"I'm serious."

They sat in silence, but it was different now. Not uncomfortable. Not heavy. Just—present. Real.

Noel watched the steam rise from his cocoa, watched the way the light caught in it, and tried to find the words for what he was feeling.

Around them, the café continued its quiet observation. Glances. Whispers. The low hum of a town that had just received confirmation of what it had suspected for days.

"I'm not good at this," Noel said finally.

"At what?"

"Receiving help. Being taken care of. Admitting I—" He stopped. The word caught in his throat like a physical thing.

Eben waited. Didn't push. Just sat there with his hands wrapped around his own mug, patient as a saint, steady as stone.

"I need—" Noel tried again.

The sentence hung there. Unfinished. Incomplete.

*Need* was dangerous. *Need* was admission. *Need* was vulnerability in a way that Noel didn't know how to handle, didn't know how to voice, didn't know how to survive.

He couldn't finish it. Not yet. Not here, with the whole town watching, with his heart in his throat and his wrist still aching and everything feeling too big, too real, too much.

Eben's hand covered his across the table. Gentle. Deliberate. Warm.

"It's okay," Eben said quietly. "You don't have to finish that sentence right now."

"But I—"

"When you're ready. I'll be here." Eben's thumb traced across Noel's knuckles. "I'm not going anywhere."

Noel's throat felt tight. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They sat there, hands touching across the table, surrounded by gossip and warmth and the smell of cocoa and cinnamon, and Noel thought: *I'm falling in love with him.*

That was terrifying.

That was also the most real thing he'd ever felt.

**EBEN**

Eben watched Noel struggle with the unfinished sentence and knew exactly what he'd been trying to say.

*I need you.*

That's what Noel had been trying to voice. What he wasn't ready to admit yet, not out loud, not in public, maybe not even to himself.

But Eben knew.

He could see it in the way Noel's eyes went wide and vulnerable. In the way his breath caught. In the way he looked at Eben like he was both terrified and hopeful at the same time.

Eben could wait. He was good at waiting. Good at being patient. Good at giving people the time and space they needed to come to him.

He'd wait as long as Noel needed.

"Come on," Eben said finally, when the silence had stretched long enough. "Let's get you home."

"Okay."

They left the café together, and Eben felt the weight of eyes on them. The town watching. Judging. Approving.

He didn't care.

All he cared about was the man beside him, walking close enough that their shoulders brushed, trusting Eben enough to let himself be seen.

That was enough.

For now, that was more than enough.
