## Chapter 5: The Request

**NOEL**

They stood at Noel's door.

Neither of them had suggested goodbye. They'd walked from the café in comfortable silence, shoulders brushing, hands occasionally touching, and now they were here in the quiet hallway, and Noel didn't want Eben to leave.

He also didn't know how to ask him to stay.

The hallway was dim. Quiet. Just the two of them and the weight of everything unsaid between them.

"Thank you," Noel said finally. "For everything today."

"You're welcome."

They stood there. The moment stretched. Eben made no move to leave, just stood there watching Noel with those steady, patient eyes.

Noel took a breath. Found his courage.

"You could stay," Noel said quietly. "If you want."

Eben's breath caught. Visible. Audible. "What?"

"You could stay. If you want. You don't have to. But—" Noel's courage faltered, but he pushed through. "You could. I want you to."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. Something shifted in his expression—surprise, want, something tender and careful.

"I want," Eben said.

Not "I want to." Just "I want."

Simple. Direct. Honest.

That was its own confession.

Noel's heart was pounding so hard he could feel it in his throat. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

Noel unlocked the door with shaking hands. They went inside together.

It felt different this time. Not desperate. Not uncertain. Not stolen or temporary or pretend.

This was deliberate. Real. A choice they were both making with open eyes.

"I should—" Noel gestured vaguely at his apartment, suddenly aware of the dishes in the sink, the jacket thrown over the couch, the general chaos of his life on display. "I don't know. Make it presentable?"

"It's fine." Eben stepped closer, into Noel's space. "You're fine."

"I wasn't expecting company—"

"Noel." Eben's hand came up to cup his face, thumb brushing his cheekbone. "It's fine. You're fine. We're fine."

Noel laughed. It sounded shaky. Breathless. "Okay."

"Okay."

They stood there in Noel's small apartment—the space that was entirely his, that he'd never really let anyone into, not like this—and Noel thought: *This is happening. This is real.*

"I've never—" Noel started, then stopped. Started again. "I mean, I've had people stay over. But not like this. Not—"

"Not what?"

"Not someone I—" He stopped. Took a breath. Found the words. "Not someone who matters."

Eben's expression softened. Went tender. "You matter too."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." Eben pulled him close. Kissed him.

It was soft. Gentle. The kind of kiss that said *I'm here* instead of *this is temporary.* The kind of kiss that felt like a promise.

When they pulled apart, Noel was breathless.

"Bed?" Eben asked quietly.

"Yeah. Okay. Yes."

**EBEN**

They got ready for bed in comfortable silence.

Eben watched Noel move through his space—the small apartment that was so clearly his, full of festival schedules and coffee mugs and the organized chaos of someone who gave everything to everyone else.

Noel lent him a shirt. It was soft, worn, smelled like Noel's laundry detergent.

They brushed their teeth side by side at the small bathroom sink, shoulders touching, meeting each other's eyes in the mirror.

It felt normal. Easy. Right.

Like they'd done this a hundred times before.

Like they'd do it a hundred times more.

When they finally climbed into bed, Eben didn't know what to expect. Didn't know what Noel wanted, what he needed, what this meant.

But then Noel curled into him, fitting against his side like he belonged there, and Eben pulled him close. Wrapped an arm around him. Pressed a kiss to his temple.

"Sleep," Eben said quietly.

"That's it?" Noel's voice was soft. Uncertain.

"That's it. Unless you want—"

"No. This is—" Noel's voice went softer. Vulnerable. "This is perfect."

They lay there in the dark, holding each other, and Eben thought: *This is what I've been missing.*

Not sex. Not performance. Not temporary arrangements or careful boundaries.

Just this. Being held. Being safe. Being with someone who didn't need him to be anything other than himself.

"Eben?" Noel whispered.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For staying."

"Thank you for asking." Eben tightened his arm around Noel. "I've been waiting for you to ask."

Noel made a small sound. Pressed closer.

Eben closed his eyes and let himself have this. Let himself hold Noel. Let himself believe, just for tonight, that this could be more than temporary.

That this could be real.

**NOEL**

Noel lay in the dark, wrapped in Eben's arms, and felt something settle in his chest.

Safe. That's what this was.

For the first time in years—maybe ever—he felt safe enough to actually sleep. Safe enough to let his guard down. Safe enough to need someone and not be terrified they'd leave.

Eben's breathing was steady against his hair. His arm was solid around Noel's waist. His presence was warm and real and here.

"I'm glad you stayed," Noel whispered into the darkness.

"I'm glad you asked," Eben whispered back.

Noel closed his eyes and let himself be held.

Let himself believe this was real.

Let himself fall asleep in the arms of someone who looked at him like he was precious, who took care of him without needing him to earn it, who stayed when Noel asked instead of finding reasons to leave.

For the first time in a very long time, Noel Merrick felt like he might actually be worth keeping.

And that was terrifying.

And that was also the most beautiful thing he'd ever felt.
