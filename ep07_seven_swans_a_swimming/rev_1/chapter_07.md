## Chapter 7: What Comes Next

**NOEL**

The town hall meeting was supposed to be routine.

Noel and Eben walked in together, still close from the morning, still warm from coffee and conversation and the promise of tonight.

Mayor Kringle was waiting for them, along with Hugh and a few other festival committee members. The mayor's expression was—complicated. Excited and nervous at the same time.

"Noel! Eben! Thank you for coming." Mayor Kringle gestured them to seats. "We have wonderful news."

"Wonderful news that required an emergency meeting?" Noel asked, settling into a chair. Eben stood behind him, hand resting on the back of Noel's chair. Possessive. Protective.

"The sponsor photos from yesterday's reception," Mayor Kringle said, pulling out his tablet. "They loved them. Loved you two. They want to feature Tinsel Town in their holiday campaign next year."

"That's—" Noel blinked. "That's amazing."

"It is! But—" Mayor Kringle's smile faltered. "They want to come back tomorrow. For the market event. To get more photos. More of the 'authentic small-town romance' they saw in you two."

Noel felt Eben's hand tighten on the chair.

"Tomorrow," Eben said flatly.

"Tomorrow! The holiday market is our biggest event. They want to capture it. The town, the people, the—" Mayor Kringle gestured vaguely. "The love story."

"We're not a love story," Noel said automatically. Then stopped. "I mean—we're not a performance."

"Of course not! But you are a couple. A real couple. And they want to feature that authenticity." Mayor Kringle leaned forward. "This could mean significant funding for next year's festival. But only if tomorrow goes perfectly."

Hugh spoke up from the corner. "No pressure or anything."

"What could go wrong?" Noel asked, feeling dread settle in his stomach.

Mayor Kringle's smile went nervous. "Well. About that. There's been a small issue with the market structure."

**EBEN**

Eben knew that tone.

That was the tone of someone about to deliver very bad news while trying to make it sound not-that-bad.

"Define 'small issue,'" Eben said.

"The main pavilion frame has some structural concerns," Mayor Kringle said carefully. "The inspector flagged it this morning. We need to reinforce it before tomorrow's event."

"How much reinforcement?"

"Significant reinforcement."

"How significant?"

Mayor Kringle winced. "We might need to rebuild sections of it."

"By tomorrow."

"By tomorrow."

Eben looked at Noel. Noel looked back at him. Some kind of silent communication happened—the kind they'd been developing over the past week, the kind that said *this is going to be a disaster* and *but we'll handle it together.*

"Okay," Noel said, standing. "We can do this. We just need to organize volunteers, get materials, coordinate the rebuild while keeping the rest of the festival running—"

"Noel," Eben said quietly.

Noel stopped. Looked at him.

"Your wrist," Eben said. "You're injured. You need to rest it."

"I can coordinate without—"

"You need to rest." Eben's voice went firm. "I'll handle the market structure. You handle the sponsor coordination and the rest of the festival. We divide and conquer."

"But—"

"Noel." Eben stepped closer, hand finding Noel's good one. "Let me help. Let us work together. You don't have to do this alone."

Noel's expression softened. "Okay. Together."

"Together," Eben agreed.

Mayor Kringle beamed. "Wonderful! I knew you two would handle it. You're such a good team."

Hugh snorted from the corner. "They're something, all right."

**NOEL**

They left the town hall with a plan.

Eben would coordinate the structural rebuild with Sam Rook and the construction volunteers. Noel would handle the sponsor liaison, the vendor coordination, and the thousand other details that went into running a festival event.

They'd work through the afternoon and evening. Then tonight—

"Tonight," Eben said as they stood outside the town hall, "you're still coming to my hotel."

"Even with all this?"

"Especially with all this." Eben pulled him close, right there on the town hall steps where anyone could see. "You need rest. You need food. You need someone to make sure you actually take care of yourself."

"Is that an order?"

"Yes."

Noel's brain did that thing again. "Okay."

Eben smiled. Kissed him, soft and quick. "Good. Now go coordinate your sponsors. I'll see you tonight."

"Tonight," Noel agreed.

They separated to handle their respective crises, and Noel thought: *This is what partnership looks like.*

Not just romance. Not just attraction. But actual partnership. Working together. Trusting each other. Dividing responsibilities and knowing the other person would handle their part.

His phone buzzed. Wes, texting: *Saw you two on the town hall steps. The photo is already circulating. You're killing the gossip mill with cuteness.*

Noel smiled. Texted back: *Good.*

Let them see. Let them know. Let them watch Noel Merrick finally let himself be cared for by someone who looked at him like he was precious.

He had work to do. Sponsors to coordinate. A festival to save.

But tonight—tonight he'd let himself be taken care of.

Tonight he'd let himself believe this was real.

And maybe, just maybe, he'd find the courage to finish that sentence.

*I need you.*

Not today. But soon.

**EBEN**

Eben coordinated the market rebuild with the efficiency of someone who'd spent his entire career solving impossible problems on impossible timelines.

Sam Rook showed up with tools and expertise. Hugh appeared with volunteers and chaos. The town rallied, the way it always did, everyone stepping up because that's what Tinsel Town did.

But through it all, Eben kept thinking about tonight.

About Noel in his hotel room. About taking care of him properly. About the four days they had left and what came after.

He'd meant what he said this morning. He wanted there to be a next. Wanted to figure out how to make this work beyond the festival, beyond the temporary contract, beyond the twelve days of Christmas chaos.

He just had to convince Noel it was possible.

Had to convince Noel he was worth keeping. Worth staying for. Worth building something real with.

Eben thought he could do that.

He had four days.

He was going to make them count.

The market structure was coming together. The town was working. Tomorrow would be chaos, but they'd handle it.

Together.

That was the word that mattered.

Together.

Eben pulled out his phone, texted Noel: *Dinner at 7. My hotel. Don't be late.*

Noel's response came immediately: *Is that an order?*

Eben smiled. Typed: *Yes.*

Three dots. Then: *Good.*

Eben pocketed his phone and got back to work.

Four days left.

And then they'd figure out what came next.

Together.
