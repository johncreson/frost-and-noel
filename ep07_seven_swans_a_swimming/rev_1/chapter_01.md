## Chapter 1: Ice Rink Setup

**NOEL**

Noel was fine.

He was also on four hours of sleep, running on his third coffee, and pretty sure he'd forgotten to eat yesterday. But fine. Definitely fine.

The ice rink looked beautiful, at least. Lights strung around the perimeter like frozen stars. Hot cocoa station set up with Hugh's signature excessive enthusiasm. Music playing softly through the speakers—something instrumental and wintery that made the whole scene feel like a snow globe.

It was going to be a great event.

He just had to survive it first.

"You should rest."

Noel jumped. Eben had appeared at his elbow with his usual stealth, clipboard in hand, expression unreadable.

"I'm good," Noel said, forcing brightness into his voice.

"You've said that three times in the last hour."

"Because it's true."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him, the way he did when he was cataloging problems to solve. "When did you last eat?"

"I—" Noel paused, genuinely trying to remember. "Yesterday?"

"Noel."

"I've been busy."

"You're always busy." Eben's jaw tightened in that way that meant he was holding back something stronger. "After this event, you're resting."

"After this event, there's the market setup tomorrow."

"Noel."

"What?"

"You can't keep doing this."

"Doing what?"

"Running yourself into the ground." Eben's voice went quiet. Dangerous. "For people who would understand if you slowed down."

Noel smiled. It felt brittle on his face, like ice about to crack. "But I'm—"

He stopped himself before saying it again. Eben was watching him too closely.

Eben didn't look convinced. But he also didn't push. Just reached into his coat pocket and produced a protein bar.

"Eat."

"I don't—"

"Eat. Now."

The command in Eben's voice did something to Noel's brain. Short-circuited it completely. He took the protein bar. Unwrapped it. Ate it while Eben watched him the entire time with those steady, assessing eyes.

"Better?" Noel asked when he'd finished.

"Marginally."

"I'll take it."

They stood there for a moment, surrounded by the chaos of event setup—volunteers stringing lights, families starting to arrive, Hugh doing something with tinsel that would probably end in disaster—and Noel thought: *He's worried about me.*

That was new. Nice. Terrifying.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly.

"You're welcome."

Families started arriving in earnest. Kids in winter coats, faces bright with excitement. Parents with cameras ready to capture every moment. The event was starting.

Noel took a breath. Put on his event coordinator smile—the one that said everything was under control even when it absolutely wasn't.

"Let's do this," he said.

Eben caught his hand. Just for a second. A brief squeeze that said *I'm here* without words.

Then he let go, and they both got to work.

But Noel felt that touch for the rest of the morning. A warm point of contact in the cold.

**EBEN**

The event was going well.

Kids skating in wobbly circles. Families laughing. The hot cocoa station doing brisk business, steam rising into the cold air.

Noel was everywhere at once. Helping a kid tie their skates. Checking on the music. Making sure the cocoa didn't run out. Smiling at everyone, that bright, brittle smile that Eben was learning to read.

Being useful. That's what Noel did. What he thought he had to do.

Eben watched from the side, tracking Noel's movements, cataloging the exhaustion in the set of his shoulders, the way he was moving just a fraction slower than usual.

Hugh appeared, covered in what looked like hot cocoa and possibly glitter.

"How do you always end up covered in something?" Noel asked, laughing.

"It's a gift." Hugh grinned, then his expression shifted, going serious. "You look exhausted."

Noel's smile didn't waver. "I'm good."

"You keep saying that."

"Because it's true."

Hugh looked past Noel to Eben. Eben looked back. Some kind of silent communication happened—Hugh's eyebrows raising in question, Eben's slight nod in acknowledgment.

*I'm watching him. I know.*

"What?" Noel asked, glancing between them.

"Nothing," they said in unison.

Noel didn't believe them. Eben could see it in the way his eyes narrowed. But he also didn't have time to argue. A kid was waving at him from the ice, needing help.

"Excuse me," Noel said, and headed onto the ice.

Behind him, Hugh leaned in close. "He's going to collapse if he keeps this up."

"I know."

"You going to do something about it?"

"I'm trying." Eben's hands tightened on his clipboard. "He doesn't make it easy."

"He doesn't know how to accept help. Never has." Hugh's expression went soft. "But he's trying. With you. I can see it."

Eben watched Noel on the ice, crouched down beside a nervous kid, patient and gentle, completely focused on making this child feel safe.

That's who Noel was. He gave everything to everyone else and kept nothing for himself.

Eben's chest felt too tight.

Then Noel was moving, helping the kid find their balance, and Eben saw it happen in slow motion.

Noel's attention was entirely on the child. He didn't notice his own skate catching. Didn't notice his balance shifting wrong.

Not until it was too late.

Noel went down hard, twisting to protect the kid even as he fell.

Eben was already moving.
