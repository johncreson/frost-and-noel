## Chapter 6: Morning Light

**EBEN**

Eben woke up to sunlight and the weight of Noel's head on his chest.

For a moment, he just lay there, not moving, trying to memorize the feeling.

This was different. This was trust.

Noel was still asleep, breathing slow and even against Eben's skin. His bandaged wrist was visible on top of the blanket, a reminder of yesterday's fall, of Eben catching him, of the photo that was probably still circulating through the town's group chats.

Noel's face was relaxed in a way Eben had never seen while he was awake. Peaceful. Safe. Like he'd finally let himself stop performing, stop being useful, stop being fine.

Like he'd finally let himself just be.

Eben's chest felt too full.

*I could get used to this,* he thought. *I shouldn't. But I could.*

Four days. They had four days left of the festival.

And then what?

Eben had a job. A life. Commitments that existed outside of Tinsel Town, contracts waiting for him in other cities, other projects that needed his expertise.

But he also had this. Noel. The possibility of something more than temporary.

He didn't know how to make it work.

He just knew he wanted to try.

Noel stirred. Blinked awake slowly, like he was surfacing from deep water. Looked up at Eben with sleepy, vulnerable eyes.

"Morning," Noel mumbled, voice rough with sleep.

"Morning."

"You stayed." There was wonder in Noel's voice. Like he'd half-expected to wake up alone.

"I stayed."

Noel smiled. It was soft. Real. Unguarded. "Good."

"Good," Eben echoed.

They lay there for a moment, neither moving, just being. The morning light filtered through Noel's curtains, painting everything gold. Outside, the town was waking up—distant sounds of traffic, voices, life continuing.

But in here, it was just them.

"How's your wrist?" Eben asked quietly.

"Sore. But okay."

"You need to ice it today. And rest it."

"I will."

"Noel."

"I will. I promise." Noel shifted, propping himself up on his good elbow to look at Eben properly. "I'm trying. To let myself be taken care of. It's just—new."

"I know." Eben reached up, brushed a strand of hair from Noel's forehead. "You're doing well."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

Noel's smile went brighter. That praise-seeking look that Eben was learning to recognize, learning to give what Noel needed.

"Good," Noel said softly.

They stayed in bed longer than they should have. Talking quietly. Touching gently. Learning the shape of each other in morning light instead of darkness.

This was intimacy. Real intimacy. Not performance, not temporary, not stolen moments between festival crises.

This was choosing each other. In daylight. With open eyes.

**NOEL**

Noel made coffee while Eben showered.

It felt domestic. Normal. Like they'd done this a hundred times before instead of this being the first morning-after they'd ever had.

He could hear the water running, could imagine Eben in his shower, using his soap, existing in his space like he belonged there.

The thought made Noel's chest feel warm.

His phone buzzed. Multiple times. He picked it up, saw the notifications.

The photo from yesterday had spawned an entire conversation thread in the community group chat. Mrs. Henderson had shared it with commentary ("So sweet! Our boys!"). Wes had added a gif. Hugh had contributed chaos.

And underneath it all, genuine warmth. The town was happy for them.

Noel scrolled through the messages, feeling something settle in his chest. Not anxiety. Not fear.

Just—acceptance. The town knew. The town saw. And the town was glad.

The shower turned off. A moment later, Eben emerged, hair damp, wearing yesterday's clothes, looking rumpled and real and here.

"Coffee?" Noel offered.

"Please."

They sat at Noel's small kitchen table, drinking coffee, and it felt like the most natural thing in the world.

"The photo's still making rounds," Noel said, showing Eben his phone.

Eben looked at it. His expression softened. "They're happy for us."

"Yeah." Noel set his phone down. "Is that weird? That I don't mind?"

"No." Eben reached across the table, took Noel's hand. "It's not weird. It's honest."

"I thought I'd be more freaked out. About everyone knowing."

"Are you freaked out?"

Noel considered. "No. I'm—" He paused, searching for the word. "I'm okay with it. With them knowing. With this being real instead of secret."

"Good," Eben said quietly. "Because I'm not interested in hiding."

"No?"

"No." Eben's thumb traced across Noel's knuckles. "I'm interested in this. In you. In figuring out what comes after the festival ends."

Noel's breath caught. "After?"

"After." Eben's eyes were steady. Certain. "I have four days left in Tinsel Town. I want to spend them with you. And then—we figure out what comes next."

"You want there to be a next?"

"I want there to be a next." Eben squeezed his hand. "If you do."

Noel felt his eyes burning. "Yeah. I do."

"Then we'll figure it out."

They sat there, hands linked across the table, morning light streaming through the windows, and Noel thought: *This is real. This is actually real.*

Not temporary. Not pretend. Not performance.

Real.

**EBEN**

Eben's phone buzzed. He checked it, frowned.

"What?" Noel asked.

"Mayor Kringle. Wants to meet about tomorrow's market event." Eben read the message. "Says there's been a development."

"What kind of development?"

"Doesn't say. Just wants us at the town hall in an hour."

Noel sighed. "Back to work, then."

"Back to work." Eben stood, but didn't let go of Noel's hand. "But tonight—"

"Tonight?"

"Stay with me tonight. At my hotel." Eben pulled Noel up, into his arms. "Let me take care of you properly. Dinner. Rest. No festival emergencies."

"You think we can avoid festival emergencies?"

"I can try." Eben kissed him, soft and sweet. "Say yes."

"Yes," Noel said against his mouth. "Yes."

They got ready together. Eben borrowed a clean shirt. Noel re-wrapped his wrist. They moved around each other easily, naturally, like they'd been doing this for years instead of hours.

Before they left, Eben caught Noel at the door. Pulled him close.

"Thank you," Eben said quietly. "For asking me to stay."

"Thank you for staying."

"Always," Eben said. "I'll always stay when you ask."

Noel's eyes went bright. "Promise?"

"Promise."

They left Noel's apartment together, walking close, shoulders brushing, and Eben thought: *Four days. We have four days to figure this out.*

He was going to make every single one of them count.

Because this—whatever this was between them—it was real.

And Eben Frost was done pretending otherwise.
