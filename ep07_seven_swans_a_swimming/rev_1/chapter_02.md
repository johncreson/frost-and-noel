## Chapter 2: The Fall

**NOEL**

Noel hit the ice hard.

One second he was helping a kid find their balance, making sure small hands were steady on small skates. The next, his own balance was gone—his skate caught on something, his body twisted wrong to keep the kid safe—and he was falling.

His wrist took the impact. Sharp, immediate pain that made his vision white out for a second.

He landed on his side, breath knocked out of him, ice cold against his cheek.

The kid he'd been helping was fine—Noel had made sure of that, even while falling. That's what mattered.

"Are you okay, mister?" The kid's voice, worried and small.

"I'm good!" Noel said automatically, even as his wrist screamed at him. *Internal monologue: I am absolutely not good. This is bad. This is very bad.*

His wrist was on fire. His hip hurt. His pride was somewhere on the ice, probably shattered into a thousand pieces along with his dignity.

"Noel."

He looked up. Eben was there. Just—there. Like he'd materialized out of thin air, like he'd been waiting for this exact moment.

Like he'd known it was coming.

"I'm—" Noel started, then stopped. Eben's expression was murder. Controlled, precise murder. "My wrist hurts."

"Let me see."

"It's probably nothing—"

Eben's hand on his arm. Gentle but absolutely firm. "Let. Me. See."

The command in Eben's voice did that thing again. Made Noel's brain go quiet and obedient in a way that should probably concern him but mostly just felt like relief.

He held out his wrist.

Eben knelt on the ice beside him, careful and deliberate. His touch was gentle as he examined the injury. Professional. Precise. His expression was still murder.

"Can you move it?" Eben asked, voice steady.

Noel tried. Winced hard. "Yeah. Ow. Yes."

"Does this hurt?" Eben pressed lightly on the bone.

"No."

"This?"

"A little."

"Noel."

"Okay, yes. It hurts. It hurts a lot."

Eben's jaw tightened. Something dangerous flickered in his eyes. "First aid station. Now."

"I need to check on the event—"

"Now."

There was no room for argument in that single word. Noel let himself be helped up, let Eben guide him off the ice with a hand on his back, steady and warm even through his jacket.

Let himself be taken care of.

It felt strange. Unfamiliar. Like wearing someone else's clothes, like speaking a language he'd never learned.

But also—nice. In a terrifying, vulnerable, completely overwhelming way.

**EBEN**

Eben had seen it happen.

Had watched Noel's attention focus entirely on the child, watched him not notice his own skate catching, watched the fall happen in slow motion while Eben was too far away to stop it.

Had watched Noel twist mid-fall to protect the kid, taking the full impact himself.

Of course he had. That's who Noel was.

Now Eben was guiding him off the ice, hand on his back, trying to keep his expression neutral when what he really wanted to do was wrap Noel in bubble wrap and lock him somewhere safe.

Hugh appeared to take over the event. Wes materialized with ice wrapped in a clean towel. The town moved around them like a well-oiled machine, everyone stepping up because they knew Noel needed them to.

Because they loved him.

Eben guided Noel to the first aid station—a converted storage closet that was private and warm and far enough from the chaos.

"Sit," Eben said.

Noel sat.

Eben knelt in front of him, first aid kit already open, and let himself take a breath. Let himself look at Noel—really look at him.

Pale. Shaking slightly. Trying so hard to smile through the pain.

"This is going to sting," Eben said, cleaning the abrasion on Noel's palm where he'd caught himself.

It did sting. Noel didn't make a sound, just bit his lip and looked away.

Eben worked in silence. Focused. Precise. Gentle.

Like Noel was something fragile. Something precious. Something that mattered more than anything else in this entire town.

Because he was.

Noel watched him with those bright, vulnerable eyes, and Eben thought: *I'm in so much trouble.*

The good kind of trouble.

The kind that felt like coming home.

"You're hurt," Eben said quietly, wrapping the bandage. "You're allowed to be hurt."

"I know," Noel said. But his voice said he didn't know. Not really.

"Do you?"

Noel looked away. "I'm trying to."

"That's enough," Eben said. "Trying is enough."

He finished the bandage. Checked it twice. Made sure it was secure.

Then he looked up and found Noel watching him with an expression that made Eben's chest feel too full.

"Thank you," Noel whispered.

"Always," Eben said.

And meant it.
