## Chapter 3: The Care

**EBEN**

Eben's hands were steady. They were always steady.

That was the thing about Eben Frost—he held everything together. Other people's crises, festival logistics, his own carefully controlled emotions.

Right now, he was holding Noel's wrist like it was the most important thing in the world.

Because it was.

The first aid room was small. A converted storage closet, really, with a narrow bench and shelves of supplies. Private. Or it was supposed to be.

The door didn't close all the way. There was a crack. Neither of them noticed.

Eben had already shrugged off his coat. His sweater followed—the thick wool one that Noel had once said made him look like a very attractive lumberjack. He pulled Noel's jacket off gently, careful of the injured wrist, and wrapped his own coat around Noel's shoulders.

"What are you doing?" Noel asked, voice small.

"You're cold. Body warmth helps." Eben sat beside him on the narrow bench, close enough that their shoulders touched, their thighs pressed together. "You're shivering."

"I didn't notice."

"I noticed."

Eben took Noel's uninjured hand and held it between both of his, warming it. The injured wrist he examined with careful, gentle touches, probing the swelling, checking for breaks.

In the doorway—just a crack of space—light shifted. Neither of them saw it.

"Does this hurt?" Eben asked, fingers gentle on Noel's wrist.

"A little."

"This?"

"No."

"Good." Eben wrapped the bandage carefully. Precisely. Each layer deliberate. "You need to ice this. And rest it. No arguing."

"I will."

"Noel."

"I will. After the event."

Eben's jaw tightened. He finished the bandage, then looked up at Noel. Really looked at him. "The event is covered. Hugh has it. Wes is helping. The town is handling it."

"But—"

"You're hurt. You need to rest."

Noel's smile was automatic. Brittle. "I'm—"

"Don't," Eben said quietly. "Don't say you're fine."

Noel stopped. Blinked. "What?"

"You don't have to be fine." Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's face, thumb brushing his cheekbone. "Not with me. You don't have to be fine."

The words hit like a physical blow. Noel stared at him, eyes wide and vulnerable.

"I don't—I don't know how to not be fine," Noel whispered.

"I know." Eben's voice went soft. Gentle. "I know you don't."

"I have to be useful. If I'm not useful, then—" Noel's voice cracked. "Then why would anyone keep me around?"

The silence stretched. Eben's thumb traced Noel's cheekbone, slow and deliberate.

"That's not how this works," Eben said quietly.

"How what works?"

"Us." Eben leaned closer, their foreheads almost touching. "You don't have to earn this. You don't have to be useful. You just have to be. Just—be here. With me. That's enough."

Noel's eyes were burning. "I don't know how to do that."

"Then I'll teach you." Eben's voice was steady. Sure. "I'll teach you how to let yourself be cared for. How to accept help. How to believe you're worth keeping even when you're hurt."

Noel laughed. It sounded wet. Broken. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

In the doorway—just for a second—a flash of light. Bright and sudden.

A phone camera.

Eben's head snapped toward the door. The crack was still there. The light was gone. A shadow disappearing down the hallway.

"Was that—" Noel started, voice sharp with sudden awareness.

"Yes." Eben's voice went flat. Cold. "Someone took a photo."

Someone had photographed them. Through the cracked door. Eben with his coat wrapped around Noel, his hand on Noel's face, their bodies close and intimate in a way that left absolutely nothing to imagination.

"Eben—" Noel's voice was panicked.

"I saw them. I don't know who." Eben's jaw was tight, anger simmering under his skin. "They're gone now."

Noel felt cold. Not from the ice rink. From the sudden, visceral awareness that whatever privacy they'd had was probably already circulating through Tinsel Town's group chats. That photo would be everywhere by dinner.

"What do we do?"

Eben looked at him. Then, deliberately, he finished checking the bandage. Adjusted it. Made sure it was secure. Took his time.

"Nothing," Eben said finally. "We don't hide. We don't explain. We don't apologize for what they saw."

"That's terrifying."

"I know." Eben's hand found Noel's again. Squeezed. "But I meant what I said. You don't have to earn this. And I'm not going to pretend we're something we're not just because someone took a picture."

"What are we?"

"Real," Eben said simply. "We're real."

**NOEL**

Noel sat there, Eben's coat warm around his shoulders, Eben's hand solid in his, and tried to process what had just happened.

Someone had photographed them. In a private moment. Eben taking care of him, touching his face, looking at him like he was something precious.

The whole town would see it.

The whole town would know.

And Eben was saying they should do nothing. Just—be.

"You're allowed to need help," Eben said, still holding his hand. "You're allowed to be hurt. You're allowed to not be fine. And apparently—" his mouth quirked, dark humor surfacing— "we're also allowed to be gossip."

Noel laughed despite himself. Despite everything. "You're taking this well."

"I'm compartmentalizing. The panic will come later."

"Noted."

"Come on," Eben said, standing and pulling Noel up with him. "We're getting you cocoa."

"I should check on the event—"

"Hugh has it. Wes is helping. The town is fine." Eben's voice went firm. "You are going to sit down, drink cocoa, and let yourself be taken care of. The fact that someone took a photo of us doesn't change any of that."

"Is that an order?"

"Yes."

Noel's brain short-circuited again. "Okay."

Eben smiled. Actually smiled, small and genuine. "Good."

They left the first aid station together, Noel's wrist carefully bandaged, and Noel thought: *I could get used to this.*

Being cared for. Being allowed to not be fine. Being allowed to need someone.

Being with someone who didn't need him to be useful to be worth keeping.

The fact that someone had photographed them should probably bother him more.

It didn't.

If the whole town wanted to know that Eben Frost looked at Noel Merrick like he was something precious—well.

Let them look.

Let them see what real looked like.
