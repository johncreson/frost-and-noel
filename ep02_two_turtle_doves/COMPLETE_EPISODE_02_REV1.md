# Chapter 1: Morning Friction

Noel had spent all night not thinking about Eben Frost.

This required such an aggressive amount of not-thinking that he'd barely slept, which rather defeated the purpose.

He'd stared at his ceiling for hours. Counted sheep. Counted festival vendor applications. Counted all the reasons why yesterday had been perfectly normal and professional and absolutely not worth obsessing over.

Reason number one: Eben was a colleague. Colleagues made eye contact. That was normal.

Reason number two: Eben had said "temporary." Temporary meant nothing. It was just a word. Words didn't mean anything unless you let them.

Reason number three: The way Eben had looked at him in the parking lot—like Noel was a problem he couldn't solve—meant absolutely nothing. Professional assessment, that was all.

Reason number four: The coffee Eben had made was just coffee. Good coffee, but coffee nonetheless. It did not represent caring. It represented basic workplace courtesy.

Reason number five: Noel needed to stop making lists about a man he'd known for exactly one day.

Reason number six: Actually, that was the only real reason that mattered. Everything else was deflection. Very elaborate, very exhausting, completely pointless deflection.

The count of reasons had reached somewhere around four hundred and twelve when Noel had given up and made coffee at 4 AM.

His apartment was small. Efficient. The kind of place that suggested someone who didn't have time for decorating because he was too busy keeping an entire town's holiday season from collapsing. The only thing on the walls was a calendar that still showed November because Noel hadn't had thirty seconds to flip it.

Now, driving through the dark streets of Tinsel Town at 5:47 AM, Noel was running on spite, caffeine, and the desperate hope that today would be different.

Normal. Professional. Not weird.

The town passed by his windows in a blur of twinkle lights and wreaths. Every lamppost decorated. Every storefront glowing. Tinsel Town took its name seriously, and on December fifteenth, it looked like someone had dropped a Christmas catalog into a snow globe and shaken vigorously.

Noel pulled into the Merryweather Hall parking lot and immediately spotted Eben's car.

Already here.

Of course he was already here.

The rental was a sensible sedan, dark gray, parked in the spot closest to the door with geometric precision. Because of course Eben Frost would park geometrically.

Noel sat in his own slightly dented hatchback for a moment, gripping the steering wheel, and tried to remember how to be a normal human person who hadn't spent the entire night replaying the way Eben had said "temporary" like it hurt him.

"Professional," Noel whispered to the dashboard. "You can do professional."

The dashboard, wisely, did not respond.

He got out of the car.

The cold hit him like a slap—sharp, clean, smelling of pine and impending disaster. His breath fogged in the pre-dawn dark. Somewhere, a snowplow was grinding along Main Street.

The hall was warm when he entered. Lights on. Heat humming through the old radiators. And there, in the main planning room, was Eben Frost.

Working.

At 5:50 AM.

With fresh coffee brewing.

The scent hit Noel first—rich, dark, the kind of coffee that meant someone knew what they were doing. Not the burnt offering that came from the ancient pot Noel usually wrestled with.

Good coffee. Perfect coffee.

Noel stopped in the doorway.

Eben sat at the long table, laptop open, files arranged in neat stacks. He was wearing a charcoal sweater today—soft-looking, expensive. His hair was perfect. His posture was perfect. Everything about him was exactly as controlled as yesterday.

Except for the shadows under his eyes.

Faint, but visible. Like maybe he hadn't slept either.

Not that Noel was looking that closely.

Eben looked up.

Their gazes locked. The moment stretched—electric, unbearable—and neither of them seemed to remember how to breathe.

Then Eben said, "You're early."

"I'm on time," Noel corrected, crossing to the coffee maker because he needed something to do with his hands. Something that wasn't staring. "You're early."

"I'm on time. You're late."

"It's not even six yet."

"You usually arrive at 5:45."

Noel froze with his hand on a coffee mug—the blue one with the chipped handle that he always used. "How do you know that?"

"I pay attention."

The words sat between them like a confession.

Noel poured coffee. Tried to ignore the way his pulse had jumped. Tried very hard not to read into the fact that Eben had noticed his schedule. Had paid attention. Had apparently catalogued Noel's arrival time like it mattered.

People paid attention. It was normal. Professional.

He took a sip.

The coffee was perfect.

Rich and dark and exactly the right temperature, with just a hint of something almost sweet underneath—like Eben had somehow figured out that Noel took his coffee with the barest splash of cream.

Noel hated that it was perfect.

"You made coffee," he said.

"I did."

"You didn't have to do that."

"I was making it anyway."

"Right. Of course." Noel took another sip. "It's good."

"Thank you."

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. The radiator clanked. Outside, the snowplow finished its pass and the world went quiet.

Silence.

Noel stared at his coffee. Eben returned to his laptop. The space between them felt very large and very small at the same time.

This was fine.

This was normal.

This was absolutely excruciating.

"So," Noel said finally. "Today's schedule."

"I updated it." Eben didn't look up. His fingers moved across the keyboard with that same precise, measured quality he brought to everything. "The vendor check-ins are at nine. Volunteer briefing at ten. Equipment inspection at eleven."

"You updated the schedule."

"You were going to do it this morning. I did it last night."

"When last night?"

"After I left."

After he left. After they'd said goodnight in the parking lot. After Noel had driven home and not slept and thought about Eben for eight straight hours.

Eben had gone home and updated the schedule.

"That's very..." Noel searched for a word. "Efficient."

"Thank you."

"I wasn't sure it was a compliment."

Eben's mouth twitched. The barest movement. Almost a smile.

"I'll take it as one anyway."

Noel's chest did something complicated. A flutter. A squeeze. The kind of internal earthquake that happened when someone unexpected did something unexpectedly kind.

He sat down across from Eben. Pulled out his own laptop. Tried to focus on the screen and not on the fact that Eben was three feet away, looking unfairly put-together for someone who'd also probably not slept.

"Did you sleep?" Noel asked before he could stop himself.

Eben's fingers paused on his keyboard. "Some."

"How much is some?"

"Enough."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the answer you're getting."

Noel looked at him. Really looked.

The shadows were definitely there. And there was something in the set of Eben's jaw—tight, controlled—that suggested he was working very hard to maintain his composure.

"You didn't sleep either," Noel said quietly.

"I slept enough."

"Eben—"

"We have work to do."

The deflection was so obvious it hurt.

Noel let it go. Because what was he supposed to say? *Did you also spend all night thinking about me? About yesterday? About the way you said 'temporary' like you were trying to convince yourself?*

He couldn't say any of that.

So he said, "Right. Work."

They worked.

In silence that felt like holding breath.

The coffee was still perfect.

Noel still hated it.

An hour passed. The hall started to wake up around them. Volunteers arriving. Vendors setting up. The familiar chaos of festival preparation filtering through the building like a rising tide.

Noel threw himself into it. Solved problems. Directed people. Smiled until his face hurt.

And tried very, very hard not to notice every time Eben looked at him.

Which was often.

Too often.

Every time Noel glanced up, Eben was watching. Not obviously—nothing so crass as staring—but with that quiet, analytical focus that made Noel feel like something being catalogued.

He should have hated it.

He didn't.

Noel was in the middle of explaining booth placement to a confused vendor—"No, Mrs. Henderson, the wreath station can't be next to the candle booth, fire hazard"—when Hugh Everhart burst through the main doors like a glittery tornado.

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice carried across the entire hall. Every head turned. "CRISIS!"

Noel excused himself from Mrs. Henderson. "What kind of crisis?"

"The best kind!" Hugh beamed, silver tinsel cape swirling behind him. "The kind where I have good news and bad news!"

"Hit me with the bad news first."

"The main planning room is unavailable today."

Noel blinked. "What?"

"My craft committee booked it three months ago! I completely forgot to tell you! We're having a glitter emergency!"

"A glitter emergency."

"The most serious kind of emergency."

"Hugh—"

"But the good news!" Hugh grabbed his arm with the enthusiasm of someone announcing a lottery win. "You can use the backup office! It's cozy!"

"How cozy?"

"Very cozy. Intimately cozy." Hugh's eyes sparkled with something that looked dangerously like matchmaking. "You and Mr. Frost will be very close. For the whole day."

Noel's stomach dropped. "Hugh—"

"Also, you need to come to Everhart Crafts with me right now. I need your opinion on ribbon."

"I don't have time for—"

"It'll be quick! Five minutes! Mr. Frost can come too!" Hugh was already pulling him toward the door. "EBEN! WE'RE GOING ON A FIELD TRIP!"

Eben looked up from his laptop. Saw Hugh. Saw Noel being dragged.

His expression did something that might have been resignation. Or possibly horror.

"Do I have a choice?" Eben asked.

"Absolutely not!" Hugh declared. "Come along! We have crafts to discuss!"

Noel caught Eben's eye. Tried to communicate an apology through sheer telepathy.

Eben stood. Put on his coat. One deliberate movement at a time, like armor being donned for battle.

"This should be interesting," Eben said.

And Noel, watching Hugh bounce excitedly toward the door, knew with absolute certainty that today was going to be anything but normal.

# Chapter 2: The Room Problem

**NOEL**

Everhart Crafts was exactly what it sounded like: chaos in retail form.

The moment they stepped through the door, Noel was assaulted by sensory overload on a scale that could only be described as "aggressive festivity." Glitter drifted through the air like malevolent snow. Hot glue fumes wafted from somewhere in the back. Holiday music—Mariah Carey, naturally—blasted from speakers mounted at strategic intervals, creating a wall of sound that suggested surrender was the only option.

"Isn't it wonderful?" Hugh swept through the aisles like a king surveying his domain. Which, technically, he was. He'd owned Everhart Crafts for fifteen years, and every inch of it reflected his personality: bright, chaotic, and absolutely immune to the concept of "too much."

"It's something," Noel said.

Eben said nothing.

He stood just inside the doorway, perfectly still, surveying the store with the expression of a man who had just walked into his own personal nightmare and was trying to maintain composure through sheer force of will.

There was glitter on the floor. Glitter on the shelves. Glitter, Noel was fairly certain, in the actual air, suspended in the fluorescent light like tiny sparkling threats.

"Hugh," Eben said, his voice very calm. "There seems to be an infestation."

"Isn't it beautiful?" Hugh beamed. "Holiday magic!"

"That's one word for it."

Noel bit the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. Eben's horror was visible in the tiniest details—the slight flare of his nostrils, the way his hands had curled into fists at his sides, the micro-expression that suggested he was calculating exactly how much dry cleaning this was going to cost.

"Now!" Hugh spun to face them with the energy of a game show host about to reveal a prize. "While I grab the ribbon, you two can make yourselves useful!"

"Hugh, we really need to get back—"

But Hugh was already pressing something into Noel's hands. A craft kit. Cellophane-wrapped. With instructions printed on the back in cheerful fonts.

"It'll take five minutes," Hugh said. "Ten tops. And you'll have adorable matching ornaments!"

"We don't need matching ornaments," Eben said.

"Everyone needs matching ornaments." Hugh was already disappearing into the ribbon aisle, which appeared to contain approximately seven thousand spools in every color known to science. "I'll be right back!"

Noel looked at the craft kit. Looked at Eben.

Eben was staring at the kit like it had personally offended his ancestors.

"We don't have to—" Noel started.

"We're doing the craft," Eben said flatly.

"Really?"

"If we don't, he'll make us come back. He has that energy about him. The energy of someone who will absolutely hold a grudge about incomplete craft projects."

Fair point.

They found a workspace near the back of the store—a scarred wooden table surrounded by half-finished projects and what appeared to be the aftermath of a glitter explosion. There were scissors, glue guns still warm from recent use, and felt squares in every shade of red and green.

A handwritten sign on the wall read: "CRAFTING IS MANDATORY JOY."

Eben stared at it for a long moment.

"This is concerning," he said.

"This is Hugh," Noel replied. "Same thing."

He opened the craft kit. Instructions for making felt turtle doves. Complete with pre-cut patterns, embroidery thread, and a truly unnecessary amount of sequins.

Of course.

"Turtle doves," Noel said.

"Appropriate," Eben replied.

"For what?"

"Day two of twelve. 'Two turtle doves.' The song progression."

Noel blinked. "You know the twelve days of Christmas song progression?"

"I have a system for tracking festival themes."

"There is no festival theme system."

"There is now."

Noel stared at him. Eben picked up a piece of felt and a needle with the careful precision of someone defusing a bomb.

They worked in silence. Mariah wailed about all she wanted for Christmas. Glitter drifted down from the ceiling—Noel was increasingly convinced Hugh must have fans installed specifically for this purpose. A child somewhere in the store shrieked with what might have been joy or might have been overwhelm.

Noel tried to thread a needle. Failed. The thread frayed between his fingers like it was mocking him.

He tried again.

Failed again.

"Here," Eben said, and took the needle from him.

Their fingers brushed.

Both of them went very still.

Eben's hands were warm. That was the first thing Noel noticed. Warm, where his own were perpetually cold. Long fingers. Precise movements. The kind of hands that looked like they could fix anything.

Eben threaded the needle in one smooth motion. Handed it back. Didn't quite meet Noel's eyes.

"Thanks," Noel said quietly.

"You're welcome."

They returned to crafting.

Noel stitched with the enthusiasm of someone who had never successfully completed a craft project in his life. His turtle dove was developing a distinct lean. The wings were uneven. One eye was significantly higher than the other, giving it the appearance of a bird that had recently sustained a head injury.

Eben's turtle dove looked like it had been engineered by a team of professionals.

"How are you good at this?" Noel demanded.

"I'm good at following instructions." Eben held up his dove. It was symmetrical. The stitches were even. The sequin eye placement was geometrically perfect.

"It's felt. And thread. How is it perfect?"

"Practice."

"You practice making felt birds?"

"I practice precision. The medium is irrelevant."

Noel looked at his sad, lopsided dove. Looked at Eben's flawless creation.

"I hate you," he said.

"No, you don't."

The certainty in Eben's voice made Noel's chest do something dangerous.

Because he was right. Noel didn't hate him. That was becoming increasingly, inconveniently clear.

---

**EBEN**

This was a disaster.

Not the craft. The craft was fine. Simple. Logical. A series of steps leading to a predetermined outcome.

The disaster was everything else.

The disaster was that Eben had just said "No, you don't" with complete confidence, revealing something he absolutely should not have revealed, and Noel was looking at him like he'd said something important.

Which he had.

Damn it.

"Done!" Hugh reappeared with an armful of ribbon in seventeen shades of red. How he'd narrowed it down to seventeen was unclear. "Oh, you made the doves! They're perfect!"

"Mine's not perfect," Noel said.

"It's charming!" Hugh picked up Noel's lopsided dove and beamed at it like it was a masterpiece. "Eben's is perfect. Yours is charming. Together they're adorable. Like a matched set."

Eben wanted to argue. Wanted to point out that turtle doves had nothing to do with festival logistics. That they were wasting time. That Noel's cheeks had gone slightly pink at "matched set" and Eben was not going to think about what that meant.

But Noel was smiling. A real smile. Not the performer smile he wore for vendors and volunteers. The one that made his eyes crinkle at the corners.

"They are kind of cute," Noel admitted, turning his drunk-looking dove in his hands.

"You're keeping them," Hugh declared. "Consider them a gift. A symbol of your partnership!"

"Hugh—"

"A SYMBOL."

There was no arguing with that tone.

They paid for the ribbon—Hugh insisted, then insisted again when Eben tried to cover the cost—and escaped into the cold morning air.

Covered in glitter.

Eben looked at his coat. There were sparkles on his sleeve. On his cuff. On the lapel of what had been, until fifteen minutes ago, a spotlessly maintained charcoal wool blend. There were probably sparkles in his hair. There were definitely sparkles on his hands.

"It's everywhere," Noel said, brushing futilely at his own jacket. Each brush just redistributed the glitter to new locations. "How is it everywhere?"

"Glitter is eternal," Eben said. "It exists outside the normal laws of physics. It cannot be destroyed, only relocated."

"That's ominous."

"That's accurate."

Noel laughed. The sound caught Eben somewhere in the chest and lodged there.

They walked back to Merryweather Hall through streets that were already stirring with activity. Shopkeepers opening doors. Volunteers heading toward the square. The scent of fresh coffee drifting from the Garland Cup as they passed.

Hugh led them through the main hall—still swarming with craft committee members and their terrifying glitter reserves—and toward a door Eben hadn't noticed before.

"Your new office!" Hugh announced, flinging it open with theatrical flourish.

It was tiny.

Eben had seen closets with more square footage. He'd seen economy airplane bathrooms with more room to maneuver.

One desk. Two chairs. A filing cabinet wedged into the corner. A window approximately eighteen inches wide that looked out on the parking lot.

And approximately three feet of space between the chairs.

If they sat down, their knees would touch.

If they so much as leaned forward, they'd be sharing air.

"Cozy!" Hugh announced. "I'll leave you to it!"

He fled before either of them could protest.

Noel stood in the doorway. Stared at the room.

"This is..." Noel started.

"Inefficient," Eben finished.

"I was going to say 'intimate.'"

"That too."

They looked at each other.

Noel's hair still had glitter in it. Catching the light. Making him look like he'd been dusted with stars. There was a sparkle on his collar, too, and one on his cheekbone—a single fleck of silver that Eben could have brushed away if he reached out.

He didn't reach out.

He looked away.

"We should set up," he said.

"Right. Yes. Set up."

They arranged themselves with careful, awkward precision. Eben took the chair facing the window. Noel took the one facing the door. Their laptops on the single desk, screens angled away from each other like shields.

Their knees almost touched.

Almost.

Eben was hyperaware of the distance. Of how small it was. Of how easy it would be to close it. One shift forward. One inch.

He opened his laptop. Focused on the screen.

Tried very hard not to notice that Noel smelled like coffee and something warm—soap, maybe, or fabric softener—and that there was still glitter on his collar and that the tiny office felt like a confessional.

"This is fine," Noel said.

"It's fine," Eben agreed.

Neither of them sounded convinced.

They worked.

In the tiny office.

Very close.

For the whole day.

Eben told himself it would be fine. Told himself he could maintain professional distance even with three feet of air between them. Told himself the glitter on Noel's collar didn't matter, and the way Noel bit his lip when he concentrated didn't matter, and the faint smell of coffee and soap and something warm didn't matter.

He told himself a lot of things.

None of them were true.

This was going to be a problem.


# Chapter 3: Competence Tension

**EBEN**

The room was approximately the size of a confession booth, which felt appropriate given what Eben was about to admit to himself.

He was watching Noel.

Not professionally. Not as part of any legitimate logistics assessment. Just... watching.

Noel worked with the kind of focused intensity that suggested he'd forgotten Eben was there. His laptop glowed in the dim office light, casting blue shadows across his face. His fingers moved across the keyboard in bursts—typing, pausing, typing again.

He bit his lower lip when he was thinking.

Eben noticed that.

He noticed a lot of things.

The tired lines around Noel's eyes—faint but visible, like cracks in plaster. The way his hair had started to fall across his forehead as the morning wore on, a dark curl that he kept pushing back absently. The slight tremor in his hands when he reached for his coffee—the fourth cup today, by Eben's count, and it wasn't even noon.

He noticed the way Noel's fingers wrapped around the mug. Long fingers. Elegant, almost. With chapped knuckles and a faint ink stain on his right thumb.

He noticed the way Noel laughed at nothing. Not out loud, just a small exhale, a quirk of his lips, like something on his screen had amused him. Like he was having a private joke with himself.

*Stop,* Eben told himself firmly. *This is not your concern.*

He returned his attention to his laptop. Spreadsheet. Vendor schedules. Things that made sense. Things that didn't make his chest feel strange and tight.

The numbers blurred.

He was thinking about the way Noel had looked at the craft store—frustrated with his lopsided turtle dove, laughing at his own incompetence. Real laughter. Not the performance smile he gave to vendors.

He was thinking about the glitter still on Noel's collar.

He was thinking about the way Noel had said "I hate you" in a voice that meant the opposite.

He was thinking about things he had no business thinking about.

Things like what Noel's hair would look like in the morning. Things like whether Noel always worked this hard, or if this was performance for Eben's benefit. Things like what it would take to make Noel actually rest—to make him believe he was worth resting for.

*Stop.*

*This is temporary.*

*This is a job.*

*He is a colleague.*

The words felt hollow even as he thought them.

Three feet away, Noel shifted in his chair.

The movement was small. Just a slight adjustment of his position. But in this room—this impossibly tiny room—it felt enormous. Eben could feel the air displacement. Could smell coffee and something warm underneath—soap, maybe, or the detergent that clung to Noel's sweater.

Could hear Noel breathe.

The scent of old books drifted from the filing cabinet. Dust motes floated in the thin light from the window. The radiator clanked its ancient complaint.

*Focus.*

He typed something. Couldn't remember what he'd typed. Backspaced.

"You're staring."

Eben's hands froze on the keyboard.

Noel hadn't looked up from his screen. His voice was casual, almost amused.

"I'm not staring."

"You keep looking at me." Now Noel did look up. His eyes—too blue, Eben had decided, unfairly blue—met Eben's across the tiny space. "Every few minutes. I can see you in my peripheral vision."

"I'm observing."

"Observing what?"

"Working patterns. For the sake of efficiency."

"You're observing my working patterns."

"Yes."

"And what have you observed?"

*That you bite your lip when you're thinking. That you drink too much coffee. That you laugh at nothing and it makes me want to know what's funny. That your hands shake when you're tired and you try to hide it. That you look exhausted and I want to tell you to rest and I have no right to want that.*

"That you're competent," Eben said instead.

Something flickered across Noel's face. Surprise, maybe. Or something closer to wonder.

"What?"

"You're good at this." The words came out before Eben could stop them. "The festival. The coordination. Handling the chaos. You're good at it."

Noel went very still.

The room felt smaller somehow. The air felt thicker. The space between them—three feet, maybe less—seemed to vibrate with something unspoken.

"That's..." Noel started. Stopped. Started again. "That's not what people usually say about me."

"What do people usually say?"

"That I'm helpful. Reliable. Good at solving problems." Noel's voice had gone quiet. Careful. "Not that I'm... good at this. Just that I'm good at being useful."

Eben looked at him.

Looked properly. Not observing. Just... seeing.

Noel Merrick, who held this entire festival together with spite and caffeine. Who smiled when he was exhausted. Who worked at 5 AM and probably 10 PM and never stopped because stopping meant admitting he needed something.

Who thought being useful was the same as being valued.

"Those aren't the same thing," Eben said.

"What?"

"Being useful and being good at something. They're different qualities."

Noel's breath caught. "Are they?"

"Yes." Eben held his gaze. "You're both. But the second one matters more."

The silence stretched.

One breath. Two.

Noel's throat moved as he swallowed.

The moment hung between them. Fragile. Dangerous.

"You should go home," Eben said quietly. "Get some rest."

"You're still here."

"That's different."

"How is it different?"

Eben didn't have an answer. Or he had too many answers, and none of them were ones he could say.

*Because I don't matter. Because I don't have anyone waiting for me. Because sleep is just another empty room in another empty apartment, and being here—even in this closet-sized office—feels less empty than that.*

"It just is," he said.

Noel's expression softened. "That's not an answer."

"It's the one you're getting."

A knock on the door made them both jump.

"Guys!" One of the volunteers—a young woman with a clipboard and a truly alarming amount of tinsel in her hair—stuck her head in. "Sorry to interrupt, but we need a decision on the cocoa station placement!"

Noel blinked. Seemed to come back from somewhere far away.

"Right. Yes. The cocoa station." He stood, his chair scraping against the floor. "I'll be right there."

The volunteer disappeared.

Noel looked at Eben.

Something passed between them. Something Eben couldn't name and didn't want to examine.

"Coffee break after?" Noel asked.

"Yes."

Noel nodded. Left.

The room felt very empty without him.

Eben sat in the silence and stared at his laptop screen. The cursor blinked at him. Accusatory. Knowing.

*What are you doing?*

He didn't have an answer.

But for the first time in years, maybe he wanted one.

# Chapter 4: The Town Interrupts

**NOEL**

Noel needed coffee.

This was not a want. This was a physiological requirement. His bloodstream was now more caffeine than hemoglobin, and if he didn't maintain the ratio, he was fairly certain his body would simply shut down in protest.

Also, he needed to get out of that tiny office.

Because Eben Frost had just said "you're good at this" like it meant something, and Noel had no idea what to do with that information except flee.

"Garland Cup?" he asked, standing in the office doorway. "I need a refill."

Eben looked up from his laptop. His expression was carefully neutral—the same controlled composure he always wore—but there was something in his eyes. Something that looked almost like concern.

"It's your fifth cup today."

"I'm not counting."

"I am."

Of course he was.

"Come with me," Noel said. "You need a break too."

"I'm fine."

"You've been staring at that spreadsheet for an hour. Your eyes are going to merge with the screen."

Eben's mouth twitched. "That's not how biology works."

"That's how this festival works. Everything here operates on slightly different physics. Haven't you noticed?"

A pause.

Then Eben stood. Closed his laptop. Put on his coat with those same deliberate, precise movements—one arm, then the other, then a slight adjustment of the collar.

"Ten minutes," he said.

"Fifteen."

"Twelve."

"Deal."

They walked out into the December air.

Tinsel Town in mid-morning was a different creature than Tinsel Town at dawn. The streets were crowded now—volunteers hauling decorations, shopkeepers chatting on sidewalks, tourists taking photos of every available surface. Someone had set up a brass quartet on the corner of Main and Holly, and "O Holy Night" drifted through the cold.

The smell of pine was everywhere. Wreaths on every door. Garlands wrapped around every lamppost. A child ran past clutching a candy cane, followed by a harried parent apologizing to anyone in their path.

Eben walked beside him.

Close.

Closer than strictly necessary, given the width of the sidewalk.

Their shoulders almost brushed.

Noel was acutely aware of every inch of space between them. Of the way Eben's coat moved when he walked. Of the faint scent of his cologne—something clean and dark, barely there but impossible to ignore.

"The town is... committed," Eben observed.

"That's one word for it."

"I was trying to be diplomatic."

"Try harder. 'Aggressively festive' is the preferred local terminology."

"Does it get exhausting? Being surrounded by this much... cheer?"

Noel considered the question. "Sometimes. But it's also kind of wonderful. Everyone here really believes in it. The magic, the community, the whole absurd Christmas thing. It's genuine."

"That's rare."

"That's Tinsel Town."

They passed the hardware store—wreath still enormous, lights still blinding—and Mr. Hendricks emerged to wave enthusiastically. "Noel! Bring your friend to cocoa night! Thursday at seven!"

"We'll see, Mr. Hendricks!"

"That wasn't optional, son!"

Noel caught Eben's expression—something between bewilderment and amusement.

"Cocoa night?" Eben asked.

"Don't ask."

Mrs. Patterson appeared in her bakery window and gave them a thumbs-up so aggressive it was practically a threat. An elderly man on a bench actually applauded as they passed.

Noel pretended not to see any of it.

The Garland Cup was warm and bright and smelled like heaven.

Coffee and cinnamon and fresh-baked something. The kind of smell that made you want to sink into a chair and never leave. Wes was behind the counter, as always, wearing an apron that read "I Run on Caffeine and Christmas Spirit."

"Well, well," Wes said, grinning as they approached. "Look who's emerged from the tiny office."

"News travels fast," Noel muttered.

"Hugh texted the group chat. With photos."

"There's a group chat?"

"There's always a group chat." Wes's eyes slid to Eben with open curiosity. "And you must be the logistics consultant I've heard so much about. Welcome to Tinsel Town's finest establishment."

"Thank you," Eben said, with the careful politeness of someone who had been raised to respond graciously to strangers even when slightly confused.

"You two look cozy," Wes continued, leaning on the counter with the air of someone settling in for good gossip. "Spending all day in that little office together. Just the two of you. Very... intimate."

"We're working," Noel said.

Wes nodded sagely. "Uh-huh."

"Professionally."

"Absolutely."

"On the festival."

"Sure."

Noel was going to kill him. Right here in the coffee shop. It would be messy and public but completely justified.

"The usual?" Wes asked, already reaching for a cup.

Before Noel could answer, Eben spoke.

"Large oat milk latte with one pump of vanilla and a quarter shot of espresso on top."

Noel blinked.

Wes blinked.

Eben's expression remained perfectly neutral.

"That's..." Noel started. "That's exactly my order."

"Yes."

"How did you know my order?"

"You mentioned it. Yesterday."

"I didn't mention it yesterday."

"Then I must be intuitive."

Wes was looking between them with the expression of someone watching a nature documentary. His eyes had gone bright with interest.

"Well," Wes said slowly. "Isn't that something."

Noel's face was warm. Too warm. He could feel the heat creeping up his neck.

Eben had remembered his coffee order. Not just remembered it—memorized it to the precise specifications. The oat milk. The vanilla. The quarter shot that Noel always felt pretentious ordering but couldn't give up because it made everything taste better.

He'd paid attention.

*Why does that matter? Why does everything he does feel like it matters?*

"And for you?" Wes asked Eben.

"Black coffee. Large."

"Of course it is." Wes shook his head. "You two are adorable."

"We're not—"

"Adorable," Noel agreed flatly. "That's definitely the word."

They waited for their drinks in a silence that felt charged. The brass quartet outside had switched to "The First Noel," which seemed unnecessarily pointed given the circumstances.

An elderly woman at a nearby table leaned over. "Excuse me, dear, but are you Noel Merrick? The festival coordinator?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Oh, wonderful!" She beamed at him, then at Eben, then back. "And is this your young man? It's so nice to see young people getting along these days. Everyone's always on their phones, but you two actually talk to each other!"

"He's not my—"

"We work together," Eben said.

"That's how it starts!" The woman winked. "My Harold and I worked together for ten years before he finally got up the nerve. Best decision he ever made."

She returned to her scone with the satisfied air of someone who had imparted wisdom.

Noel wanted to scream.

"That happens a lot here," he muttered to Eben.

"What does?"

"The assumption. The matchmaking. Everyone in this town thinks they're a relationship expert."

Eben accepted his black coffee from Wes. Took a sip. "It must be exhausting."

"You have no idea."

Their eyes met.

Held.

Something passed between them—something electric and terrifying and completely undefined.

"We should get back," Noel said.

"Yes."

They stood there. Caught.

The brass quartet played on. The coffee shop buzzed with warmth and conversation. Outside, snow had started to fall in soft, lazy spirals.

"The tiny office awaits," Noel said finally.

"Unfortunately."

They walked back.

Together.

Their shoulders brushing.

And Noel tried very hard not to think about the fact that Eben had known his coffee order, and why that single detail felt more intimate than anything that had happened in the last twenty-four hours.

# Chapter 5: Late Night Work

**NOEL**

The hall emptied around them like a tide going out.

First the volunteers, trickling away in twos and threes, waving goodnight through the office window. Then the vendors, packing up samples and closing down booths. Then the cleaning crew, whose arrival Noel always missed and whose departure he was never certain about.

By nine o'clock, the building was silent.

By ten, the silence had become its own presence.

Noel sat at his end of the tiny desk, laptop glow illuminating his face, and listened to Eben breathe.

That was the thing about this room. It was so small that he could hear everything. The click of Eben's keyboard. The soft tap of his fingers on the desk when he was thinking. The slight rustle of fabric when he shifted in his chair.

The slow, steady rhythm of his breathing.

In. Out. In. Out.

It was... something. Intimate. That was the word Noel had been avoiding all day, but there was no getting around it now. Sitting three feet apart in the dark, lit only by laptop screens, hearing each other breathe—this was intimate.

More intimate than coffee. More intimate than crafts. More intimate than all the accidental touches and loaded silences of the past twelve hours.

This was something else entirely.

Noel tried to focus on his laptop. Vendor spreadsheet. Payment schedules. Numbers that should mean something.

They didn't mean anything.

All he could think about was the shape of Eben in his peripheral vision. The way his shoulders moved when he typed. The way his jaw was set—tight, controlled, like he was holding something back.

What was he holding back?

What were either of them holding back?

The building creaked around them. Old bones settling into the cold. Somewhere deep in the walls, a pipe groaned—a long, low sound that seemed to come from everywhere at once. The radiator in the corner clanked and hissed, fighting its eternal battle against the December air.

Outside, the wind picked up. Snow scratched against the window like fingernails. The parking lot lights flickered once, twice, then steadied.

"You should go home."

Eben's voice cut through the quiet like a blade.

Noel looked up. "What?"

"It's late. You should rest."

"You're still here."

"That's different."

"How is that different?"

Eben didn't answer.

Outside the window, snow fell in lazy spirals, catching the parking lot lights. From somewhere far away, Noel could hear the brass quartet packing up—the click of instrument cases, a muffled laugh, a car door slamming.

The town settling into sleep.

Everyone going home.

Everyone except them.

"I'm fine," Noel said.

"You're exhausted."

"I'm always exhausted. It's a lifestyle choice."

"That's not a lifestyle. That's self-destruction with better branding."

Noel stared at him.

Eben stared back.

His eyes were very dark in the dim light. The laptop glow caught the planes of his face, the sharp cut of his jaw, the careful neutrality of his expression that Noel was beginning to suspect was anything but neutral.

"That's a bit dramatic," Noel said.

"That's accurate."

"You don't know how I operate."

"I know you haven't slept properly since I arrived. I know you drink coffee instead of eating. I know you smile when you're falling apart because you think no one will notice."

The words landed like blows.

Noel's throat went tight.

"You noticed," he said quietly.

"Yes."

"Why do you care?"

Eben's fingers stopped moving. The keyboard went silent. For a long moment, the only sound was the snow against the window and the ancient radiator clanking its complaint.

"I don't know," Eben said finally. "That's the problem."

The honesty hit Noel somewhere in the chest. A bloom of warmth. A flutter of something dangerous.

He should change the subject. Should redirect to schedules, logistics, safe territory. Should do literally anything except sit here in the dark, too close, too aware, feeling the space between them like a physical pressure.

Instead, he said, "The glitter's still on your collar."

Eben looked down. There, on the charcoal wool, a single fleck of silver caught the light.

"Yours too," Eben said.

Noel reached up. Touched his own collar. Found the sparkle.

Neither of them had tried to wash it off.

*What does that mean?*

*Stop asking what things mean.*

He caught himself staring at Eben's hands. Long fingers. Resting on the keyboard. The hands of someone precise and careful, someone who fixed things and controlled things and held everything at arm's length.

Except right now, those hands weren't moving. They were still. Waiting.

The hands that had threaded his needle that morning. That had handed him coffee. That had, for one brief moment in the craft store, brushed against his own.

"We should keep working," Noel said.

"Yes."

But they stayed frozen. Neither willing to be the first to break the spell.

*Temporary*, Noel reminded himself. *This is temporary. He's leaving in ten days.*

The word felt less like a wall now and more like a countdown.

The snow kept falling. The building kept creaking. The tiny office felt like the entire world, contracted to this single point of warmth in the darkness.

Noel's phone buzzed.

He grabbed it like a lifeline.

**Wes:** *You're still at the hall, aren't you?*

**Noel:** *How do you know that?*

**Wes:** *I can see the office light from my apartment. It's the only one still on.*

**Wes:** *Go home, Noel.*

**Noel:** *Soon.*

**Wes:** *Define soon.*

**Noel:** *Eventually.*

**Wes:** *That's not a definition. That's evasion.*

**Wes:** *Is Eben still there too?*

Noel glanced at Eben, who was watching him with an unreadable expression.

**Noel:** *Yes.*

**Wes:** *Interesting.*

**Noel:** *Shut up.*

**Wes:** *I didn't say anything.*

**Noel:** *You were thinking it.*

**Wes:** *Loudly.*

**Wes:** *For the record, I like him.*

**Noel:** *You've met him once.*

**Wes:** *That's enough. He looks at you like you're a puzzle he wants to solve.*

**Noel:** *That's weird.*

**Wes:** *That's romantic. There's a difference.*

**Noel:** *Go to bed, Wes.*

**Wes:** *You first. 💚*

Noel put his phone face-down on the desk.

"Everything okay?" Eben asked.

"Wes being Wes."

"What does being Wes entail?"

"Being nosy. Being insufferable. Being right about things I don't want him to be right about."

"What things?"

Their eyes met.

Held.

*You,* Noel didn't say. *You and me and whatever this is. The thing I can't name. The thing I'm not supposed to want.*

"Nothing," he said instead. "Just Wes things."

Eben nodded. Didn't push.

The silence returned. Heavy. Waiting.

Noel pulled his laptop closer. Tried to focus on the screen. On schedules and logistics and things that made sense.

But his awareness kept drifting. To the sound of Eben's breathing. To the space between them. To the glitter on both their collars that neither of them had washed away.

Intimate.

That was definitely the word.

And Noel had no idea what to do with it.

Except that wasn't quite true.

He knew exactly what he wanted to do.

He just wasn't brave enough to do it.

Not yet.

# Chapter 6: Vulnerability Slip

**EBEN**

The quiet had settled over them like snow.

Soft. Heavy. Impossible to shake off.

Eben stared at his laptop screen. The spreadsheet blurred. The numbers meant nothing. The only thing that felt real was the man sitting three feet away, typing something, pausing, typing again.

And the question he could feel building in the silence.

"Why did you take this job?"

There it was.

Noel's voice was soft. Careful. Like he was asking something dangerous and knew it.

Eben's fingers stopped moving.

He should have an answer for this. A professional answer. *The mayor asked. The contract was acceptable. I had an opening in my schedule.*

All true. All meaningless.

"I don't know," he said.

The words came out before he could stop them. Honest in a way he hadn't intended. Honest in a way he hadn't been with anyone in years.

Noel went still. "That's not an answer."

"It's the truth."

A pause.

Long. Heavy. The kind of pause that had weight.

In the dim light, Noel's face was half shadow. His eyes were very blue. Searching. Like he was trying to find something in Eben's expression that Eben wasn't sure existed.

"You could have said no," Noel said.

"I could have."

"But you didn't."

"...I didn't."

The words hung between them. Eben could feel their weight. Could feel the question underneath the question—*why did you come here? Why are you still here? Why do you look at me like that?*

He didn't have answers. That was the terrifying part. He'd built his entire life around having answers, having plans, having exits clearly marked.

Clean entry. Clean exit.

That was the rule.

The rule he'd learned after the last time he'd stayed too long. The last time he'd let himself care about someone in a town he was passing through. The last time he'd left with something broken in his chest that took years to mend.

He'd promised himself: never again.

And yet here he was. In a closet-sized office. Looking at a man made of exhaustion and stubbornness and light. Breaking every rule he'd ever made.

But right now, in this tiny office, with Noel Merrick looking at him like he was something worth understanding—

Eben had nothing.

"The mayor said you don't ask for help," Eben said. Deflecting. Redirecting. A familiar tactic.

Noel blinked. "He told you that?"

"On the phone. Before I came."

"I ask for help."

"When?"

"When I need it."

"Which is never."

Noel's jaw tightened. "That's not—"

"You've been awake for approximately forty hours in the last two days." Eben's voice was steady, but there was something underneath it. Something that felt dangerously like emotion. "You've eaten one meal that I'm aware of. You drink coffee like it's a substitute for sleep. You smile when people worry about you, which makes them stop worrying."

Noel's throat moved.

Eben kept going. He couldn't seem to stop.

"You don't ask for help. You perform being fine until people believe you. And when they stop paying attention, you fall apart quietly, where no one can see."

Silence.

One breath.

Two.

Three.

"That's..." Noel started. His voice was rough. "That's a lot."

"It's accurate."

"It's invasive."

"It's concerned."

The word sat between them. Heavy with meaning neither of them had named.

Concerned.

Not professional. Not detached. Not *temporary*.

Concerned.

"You paid attention," Noel said finally.

"Yes."

"Why?"

*Because I can't stop. Because you're the most interesting thing in this town. Because watching you pretend to be okay makes me want to fix something I don't know how to fix.*

*Because I drove eight hours through the snow for a job I didn't need, in a town I didn't want, and the only thing that made sense when I got here was you.*

"I don't know," Eben said again.

The room felt smaller. Or maybe Eben felt larger. Specifically, his chest felt too large for his ribcage, which was concerning from a cardiovascular standpoint and absolutely devastating from an emotional one.

"We're both very good at not knowing things," Noel said quietly.

"It seems that way."

"Is that a problem?"

Eben looked at him.

Really looked.

The exhaustion written into his bones. The stubborn set of his jaw. The glitter still on his collar, catching what little light there was. The way his hands—those elegant, ink-stained, trembling hands—were gripping the edge of the desk like he needed something to hold onto.

"I'm not sure yet," Eben said.

Noel nodded. Like that was an acceptable answer. Like uncertainty was something he could work with.

"We should finish the vendor scheduling," Noel said.

"Yes."

They stayed exactly where they were. As if moving might shatter something fragile.

The building creaked around them. Outside, the snow kept falling. Inside, the space between them felt charged, electric, waiting for something.

Noel reached for a stack of papers on the desk. Budget reports. Something safe.

Eben reached for the same stack at the same time.

Their hands brushed.

Just fingers. Just skin. Just a fraction of a second.

But neither of them pulled away.

Eben looked at their hands. At the point of contact. At Noel's fingers, cold against his warm ones. At the way they fit together—not perfectly, not neatly, but somehow right.

"Noel," he said.

It came out rough. Low. Like something he wasn't supposed to say.

Noel's breath caught.

"Yeah?"

Eben didn't know what he was asking.

Didn't know what he was offering.

Just knew that they were very close, and the tiny office was very quiet, and Noel was looking at him like—

Like he wanted—

Like he—

"I think," Eben said carefully, "that we should probably talk about this."

"Probably."

"Not right now."

"No."

"Tomorrow."

"Tomorrow."

Neither of them moved their hands.

The touching point burned like a brand.

And somewhere in the back of Eben's mind, a very rational voice was screaming that this was a terrible idea, that attachment was a structural weakness, that temporary meant temporary.

He ignored it.

He'd been ignoring it since the moment he'd walked through those doors and seen Noel Merrick smiling at chaos like it was his job.

Which, technically, it was.

"The papers," Noel said quietly.

"Right."

Eben pulled his hand back. Took the papers. Tried to remember how to breathe.

The moment passed.

But something had shifted.

Something that couldn't be unshifted.

And they both knew it.

# Chapter 7: The Kiss

**EBEN**

Their hands were still touching.

Just barely. Just fingertips brushing over papers that neither of them were actually reaching for anymore.

Eben should pull away.

Every rule he'd ever made for himself said *pull away*. Don't touch. Don't linger. Don't let yourself want things you can't keep.

He didn't pull away.

Noel didn't either.

The silence stretched between them. Loaded. Dangerous. The kind of silence that meant something was about to happen—something you couldn't take back.

Time slowed.

Or maybe Eben's perception of time had changed. Maybe this was what happened when you were about to do something irrevocable—the universe paused, gave you one last chance to reconsider.

He didn't want to reconsider.

That was the terrifying part.

Eben looked up.

Noel was already looking at him.

Their eyes met.

Held.

The tiny office felt impossibly small. The air between them felt impossibly charged. Eben could hear his own heartbeat, loud and fast, hammering against his ribs like it was trying to escape.

He could hear Noel breathing.

Shallow. Quick. Matching his own.

"Noel," he said.

The name came out quieter this time. Rougher. Like a question and a confession wrapped into one word.

First name. No distance. No formality.

Just Noel.

Noel's breath caught. His pupils dilated. His lips parted—just slightly, just enough—and Eben watched his throat move as he swallowed.

"Yeah?"

Whispered. Barely a sound.

Eben didn't know what he was asking.

Didn't know what he was offering.

Just knew that they were very close, and the room was very quiet, and Noel was looking at him like—

Like he wanted—

Like he—

---

**NOEL**

Noel didn't think.

If he'd thought, he would have stopped himself.

Would have remembered that this was temporary. That Eben was leaving in ten days. That wanting this was dangerous and stupid and guaranteed to end with Noel alone in an empty apartment, missing something he'd only just learned existed.

Would have remembered all the reasons this was a mistake.

Eben's eyes. Dark and steady and asking something Noel didn't have words for.

Eben's hand. Still touching his. Warm where Noel's was cold.

Eben's voice, saying *Noel* like it was something sacred.

All of it temporary.

All of it about to end.

But he didn't think.

Because thinking had never gotten him anywhere good. Thinking was what kept him awake at night, counting reasons why he wasn't enough. Thinking was what made him smile when he was falling apart.

Thinking was the enemy.

So he stopped.

He just leaned in.

Slowly.

So slowly.

Giving Eben time to pull away.

Giving himself time to change his mind.

Watching Eben's eyes—dark, uncertain, wanting—as the distance between them shrank.

Two inches.

One.

A breath.

They were still as stone.

And then Noel's lips touched Eben's, and thinking became impossible.

---

**DUAL**

The kiss was soft.

Questioning.

A brush of lips. A held breath. A moment of *is this okay? is this what you want?* answered without words.

Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's jaw. Gentle. Deliberate. Like Noel was something precious—something that could break if handled wrong.

His palm was warm. His fingers were steady. He held Noel like he was something worth being careful with.

Noel made a sound—small, surprised, something between a gasp and a sigh—and leaned closer.

The kiss deepened.

Became less soft.

Much less soft.

Noel's hand fisted in Eben's collar, pulling him closer, pulling him in. Eben's other hand found Noel's waist, fingers pressing through the fabric of his shirt, steadying them both.

The papers scattered off the desk. Neither of them noticed.

The laptop screens flickered. Neither of them cared.

There was only this.

Eben's mouth, warm and certain. Tasting like coffee and winter and something Noel couldn't name.

Noel's hands, desperate and demanding. Gripping like he could keep this if he just held on tight enough.

The sound of their breathing, the rustle of fabric, the soft wet sound of lips and tongues and need.

When they finally pulled apart, they were breathing hard.

Noel's eyes were wide. Stunned. Like he couldn't quite believe what had just happened.

Eben's hand was still on his jaw. His thumb traced a slow arc across Noel's cheekbone.

They stayed suspended. Frozen in the aftermath.

"Well," Eben said, after approximately seventeen years. "That happened."

Noel laughed. Breathless. Shaky. The sound broke something in the silence—not the tension, but the terrifying weight of it.

"Yeah," he said. "It did."

They stared at each other.

The tiny office felt even smaller now. Or maybe they felt larger. Maybe the world had contracted to just this moment, just this room, just the two of them.

"That was..." Noel started.

"Yes."

"I mean, really..."

"Yes."

"Are you just going to say 'yes' to everything?"

"Possibly." Eben's voice was rough. Wrecked. "I haven't recovered enough brain cells to form complete sentences."

Noel laughed again. It felt good. Felt real.

"We should—" Eben started.

"Yeah," Noel agreed.

Neither of them finished the sentence.

They stayed right where they were.

Eben's thumb brushed Noel's cheekbone again. Soft. Almost unconscious. Like he couldn't help himself.

Noel's breath hitched.

"Eben—"

"I know."

"We can't—"

"I know."

"This is—"

"I know."

Noel closed his eyes. Let out a shaky breath.

"Then why does it feel—"

"I don't know."

When Noel opened his eyes again, Eben was looking at him like he was something precious. Something breakable.

Something worth keeping.

Which was impossible. Because Eben didn't keep things. Eben left. That was the whole point.

But right now, in the dim light of the tiny office, with Eben's hand on his face and Eben's taste on his lips, nothing about that felt true.

"We should talk about this," Noel said.

"We should."

"Tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow."

It was a lie.

They both knew it was a lie.

But they nodded anyway. Like the promise meant something. Like they could postpone this conversation and everything would be fine.

Eben's hand dropped from Noel's jaw.

The loss of contact felt like a wound.

"It's late," Eben said.

"Yeah."

"You should go home."

"So should you."

For a long moment, they just stood there. Caught in the gravity of what had just happened.

Then, finally, they moved. Gathered their things. Put on their coats. Eben's hands still weren't quite steady. Noel's weren't either.

# Chapter 8: Hook Ending

**NOEL**

They walked to the door in silence.

Loaded silence. The kind that was full of everything they weren't saying.

"See you tomorrow," Noel said, hand on the doorframe.

"Six AM," Eben replied.

Something flickered between them. Recognition. Fear. Want.

Held.

Neither mentioned the kiss.

Neither mentioned the way Eben's hand had felt on Noel's jaw—gentle, certain, like Noel was something worth being careful with.

Neither mentioned the fact that they both wanted to do it again.

They just said goodnight.

And left.

And walked to their cars in opposite directions, the snow falling soft and silent around them.

---

Noel sat in his car and stared at the steering wheel.

His hands were shaking.

His lips were tingling.

His entire world had just tilted sideways, and he had no idea how to tilt it back.

He'd kissed Eben Frost.

No.

That wasn't accurate.

They'd kissed each other.

Mutual. Deliberate. Undeniable.

And now Noel was sitting in his car in the Merryweather Hall parking lot at 10:23 PM, watching Eben's taillights disappear down Main Street, and trying to figure out what the hell he was supposed to do with that information.

They'd agreed to talk tomorrow.

That was a lie.

They both knew it was a lie.

Because what was there to talk about?

They'd kissed. It had been—

God.

It had been perfect.

Eben's hand on his jaw. Gentle and certain. Like Noel was something precious. Like Noel was something worth wanting.

Noel's hand fisted in Eben's collar. Desperate and needing. Like he could keep Eben there if he just held on tight enough.

The kiss itself. Soft, then not soft. Questioning, then answering.

Everything.

It had been everything.

And it couldn't happen again.

Because Eben was temporary.

Ten more days.

Then he'd leave. Go back to his life. His clean exits and empty apartments.

And Noel would go back to being alone.

Useful. Needed. Alone.

Except now he knew what it felt like to be wanted.

Not needed. Not useful.

Wanted.

For himself.

For no reason except that Eben had looked at him and decided he was worth wanting.

Noel put his head on the steering wheel.

"What did I just do?" he whispered to the empty car.

The car, unsurprisingly, didn't answer.

His phone buzzed.

**Wes:** *I saw Eben's car leaving. You're still in the parking lot. Are you okay?*

**Noel:** *Define okay.*

**Wes:** *That bad, huh?*

**Noel:** *That good. Which is worse.*

**Wes:** *Want to talk about it?*

**Noel:** *Not even a little bit.*

**Wes:** *Okay. But I'm here if you change your mind.*

**Wes:** *And Noel?*

**Noel:** *Yeah?*

**Wes:** *Whatever happened, you deserve good things. Remember that.*

Noel stared at the message.

Deserved.

Did he deserve this?

Did he deserve Eben's careful attention and his perfect coffee-making and the way he'd said "Noel" like it meant something?

Did he deserve the kiss?

Did he deserve to want more?

Noel didn't know.

He just knew that he did want more.

Wanted it desperately.

Wanted it in a way that felt dangerous and inevitable and absolutely terrifying.

He started his car.

The engine turned over. The heater kicked on. The radio came to life, playing some soft Christmas song that felt like an insult.

He turned it off.

Drove home through the quiet streets of Tinsel Town.

The brass quartet was long gone. The storefronts were dark, their daytime sparkle reduced to the soft glow of security lights. Only the streetlights remained faithful, wrapped in their endless strings of twinkle lights, casting everything in that particular golden warmth that made Tinsel Town look like a painting.

Noel barely saw any of it.

He was replaying the kiss.

The exact moment. The exact second.

The way time had seemed to stop. The way Eben had looked at him—steady, certain—before Noel had leaned in. The way his own heart had been pounding so hard he was surprised Eben couldn't hear it.

He went inside.

His apartment was cold. He'd forgotten to turn the heat up before he left. An oversight. A symptom of a brain that had been running on crisis mode for forty-eight hours.

He didn't fix it.

Didn't eat.

Didn't shower.

Just walked straight to his bedroom, stripped off his sweater—still covered in glitter, he noticed distantly, still carrying tiny fragments of the day—and collapsed onto his bed.

The ceiling was white. Unmarked. He'd been meaning to put something up there. A poster, maybe. Something to look at during the hours he spent lying awake.

Now he didn't need decoration.

He had memories.

He just lay there and stared upward and thought about Eben's hand on his jaw and the way the tiny office had felt like the entire world and the fact that tomorrow they'd have to face each other and pretend nothing had changed.

When everything had changed.

Everything.

Noel rolled over. Stared at the dark.

Counted reasons why this was a bad idea.

Got to three hundred and forty-seven before he gave up.

"Temporary," Noel whispered to the darkness.

The word tasted like a lie.

It always had.
