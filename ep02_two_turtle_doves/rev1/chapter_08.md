# Chapter 8: Hook Ending

**NOEL**

They walked to the door in silence.

Loaded silence. The kind that was full of everything they weren't saying.

"See you tomorrow," Noel said, hand on the doorframe.

"Six AM," Eben replied.

Something flickered between them. Recognition. Fear. Want.

Held.

Neither mentioned the kiss.

Neither mentioned the way Eben's hand had felt on Noel's jaw—gentle, certain, like Noel was something worth being careful with.

Neither mentioned the fact that they both wanted to do it again.

They just said goodnight.

And left.

And walked to their cars in opposite directions, the snow falling soft and silent around them.

---

Noel sat in his car and stared at the steering wheel.

His hands were shaking.

His lips were tingling.

His entire world had just tilted sideways, and he had no idea how to tilt it back.

He'd kissed Eben Frost.

No.

That wasn't accurate.

They'd kissed each other.

Mutual. Deliberate. Undeniable.

And now Noel was sitting in his car in the Merryweather Hall parking lot at 10:23 PM, watching Eben's taillights disappear down Main Street, and trying to figure out what the hell he was supposed to do with that information.

They'd agreed to talk tomorrow.

That was a lie.

They both knew it was a lie.

Because what was there to talk about?

They'd kissed. It had been—

God.

It had been perfect.

Eben's hand on his jaw. Gentle and certain. Like Noel was something precious. Like Noel was something worth wanting.

Noel's hand fisted in Eben's collar. Desperate and needing. Like he could keep Eben there if he just held on tight enough.

The kiss itself. Soft, then not soft. Questioning, then answering.

Everything.

It had been everything.

And it couldn't happen again.

Because Eben was temporary.

Ten more days.

Then he'd leave. Go back to his life. His clean exits and empty apartments.

And Noel would go back to being alone.

Useful. Needed. Alone.

Except now he knew what it felt like to be wanted.

Not needed. Not useful.

Wanted.

For himself.

For no reason except that Eben had looked at him and decided he was worth wanting.

Noel put his head on the steering wheel.

"What did I just do?" he whispered to the empty car.

The car, unsurprisingly, didn't answer.

His phone buzzed.

**Wes:** *I saw Eben's car leaving. You're still in the parking lot. Are you okay?*

**Noel:** *Define okay.*

**Wes:** *That bad, huh?*

**Noel:** *That good. Which is worse.*

**Wes:** *Want to talk about it?*

**Noel:** *Not even a little bit.*

**Wes:** *Okay. But I'm here if you change your mind.*

**Wes:** *And Noel?*

**Noel:** *Yeah?*

**Wes:** *Whatever happened, you deserve good things. Remember that.*

Noel stared at the message.

Deserved.

Did he deserve this?

Did he deserve Eben's careful attention and his perfect coffee-making and the way he'd said "Noel" like it meant something?

Did he deserve the kiss?

Did he deserve to want more?

Noel didn't know.

He just knew that he did want more.

Wanted it desperately.

Wanted it in a way that felt dangerous and inevitable and absolutely terrifying.

He started his car.

The engine turned over. The heater kicked on. The radio came to life, playing some soft Christmas song that felt like an insult.

He turned it off.

Drove home through the quiet streets of Tinsel Town.

The brass quartet was long gone. The storefronts were dark, their daytime sparkle reduced to the soft glow of security lights. Only the streetlights remained faithful, wrapped in their endless strings of twinkle lights, casting everything in that particular golden warmth that made Tinsel Town look like a painting.

Noel barely saw any of it.

He was replaying the kiss.

The exact moment. The exact second.

The way time had seemed to stop. The way Eben had looked at him—steady, certain—before Noel had leaned in. The way his own heart had been pounding so hard he was surprised Eben couldn't hear it.

He went inside.

His apartment was cold. He'd forgotten to turn the heat up before he left. An oversight. A symptom of a brain that had been running on crisis mode for forty-eight hours.

He didn't fix it.

Didn't eat.

Didn't shower.

Just walked straight to his bedroom, stripped off his sweater—still covered in glitter, he noticed distantly, still carrying tiny fragments of the day—and collapsed onto his bed.

The ceiling was white. Unmarked. He'd been meaning to put something up there. A poster, maybe. Something to look at during the hours he spent lying awake.

Now he didn't need decoration.

He had memories.

He just lay there and stared upward and thought about Eben's hand on his jaw and the way the tiny office had felt like the entire world and the fact that tomorrow they'd have to face each other and pretend nothing had changed.

When everything had changed.

Everything.

Noel rolled over. Stared at the dark.

Counted reasons why this was a bad idea.

Got to three hundred and forty-seven before he gave up.

"Temporary," Noel whispered to the darkness.

The word tasted like a lie.

It always had.
