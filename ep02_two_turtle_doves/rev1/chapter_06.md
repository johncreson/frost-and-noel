# Chapter 6: Vulnerability Slip

**EBEN**

The quiet had settled over them like snow.

Soft. Heavy. Impossible to shake off.

Eben stared at his laptop screen. The spreadsheet blurred. The numbers meant nothing. The only thing that felt real was the man sitting three feet away, typing something, pausing, typing again.

And the question he could feel building in the silence.

"Why did you take this job?"

There it was.

Noel's voice was soft. Careful. Like he was asking something dangerous and knew it.

Eben's fingers stopped moving.

He should have an answer for this. A professional answer. *The mayor asked. The contract was acceptable. I had an opening in my schedule.*

All true. All meaningless.

"I don't know," he said.

The words came out before he could stop them. Honest in a way he hadn't intended. Honest in a way he hadn't been with anyone in years.

Noel went still. "That's not an answer."

"It's the truth."

A pause.

Long. Heavy. The kind of pause that had weight.

In the dim light, Noel's face was half shadow. His eyes were very blue. Searching. Like he was trying to find something in Eben's expression that Eben wasn't sure existed.

"You could have said no," Noel said.

"I could have."

"But you didn't."

"...I didn't."

The words hung between them. Eben could feel their weight. Could feel the question underneath the question—*why did you come here? Why are you still here? Why do you look at me like that?*

He didn't have answers. That was the terrifying part. He'd built his entire life around having answers, having plans, having exits clearly marked.

Clean entry. Clean exit.

That was the rule.

The rule he'd learned after the last time he'd stayed too long. The last time he'd let himself care about someone in a town he was passing through. The last time he'd left with something broken in his chest that took years to mend.

He'd promised himself: never again.

And yet here he was. In a closet-sized office. Looking at a man made of exhaustion and stubbornness and light. Breaking every rule he'd ever made.

But right now, in this tiny office, with Noel Merrick looking at him like he was something worth understanding—

Eben had nothing.

"The mayor said you don't ask for help," Eben said. Deflecting. Redirecting. A familiar tactic.

Noel blinked. "He told you that?"

"On the phone. Before I came."

"I ask for help."

"When?"

"When I need it."

"Which is never."

Noel's jaw tightened. "That's not—"

"You've been awake for approximately forty hours in the last two days." Eben's voice was steady, but there was something underneath it. Something that felt dangerously like emotion. "You've eaten one meal that I'm aware of. You drink coffee like it's a substitute for sleep. You smile when people worry about you, which makes them stop worrying."

Noel's throat moved.

Eben kept going. He couldn't seem to stop.

"You don't ask for help. You perform being fine until people believe you. And when they stop paying attention, you fall apart quietly, where no one can see."

Silence.

One breath.

Two.

Three.

"That's..." Noel started. His voice was rough. "That's a lot."

"It's accurate."

"It's invasive."

"It's concerned."

The word sat between them. Heavy with meaning neither of them had named.

Concerned.

Not professional. Not detached. Not *temporary*.

Concerned.

"You paid attention," Noel said finally.

"Yes."

"Why?"

*Because I can't stop. Because you're the most interesting thing in this town. Because watching you pretend to be okay makes me want to fix something I don't know how to fix.*

*Because I drove eight hours through the snow for a job I didn't need, in a town I didn't want, and the only thing that made sense when I got here was you.*

"I don't know," Eben said again.

The room felt smaller. Or maybe Eben felt larger. Specifically, his chest felt too large for his ribcage, which was concerning from a cardiovascular standpoint and absolutely devastating from an emotional one.

"We're both very good at not knowing things," Noel said quietly.

"It seems that way."

"Is that a problem?"

Eben looked at him.

Really looked.

The exhaustion written into his bones. The stubborn set of his jaw. The glitter still on his collar, catching what little light there was. The way his hands—those elegant, ink-stained, trembling hands—were gripping the edge of the desk like he needed something to hold onto.

"I'm not sure yet," Eben said.

Noel nodded. Like that was an acceptable answer. Like uncertainty was something he could work with.

"We should finish the vendor scheduling," Noel said.

"Yes."

They stayed exactly where they were. As if moving might shatter something fragile.

The building creaked around them. Outside, the snow kept falling. Inside, the space between them felt charged, electric, waiting for something.

Noel reached for a stack of papers on the desk. Budget reports. Something safe.

Eben reached for the same stack at the same time.

Their hands brushed.

Just fingers. Just skin. Just a fraction of a second.

But neither of them pulled away.

Eben looked at their hands. At the point of contact. At Noel's fingers, cold against his warm ones. At the way they fit together—not perfectly, not neatly, but somehow right.

"Noel," he said.

It came out rough. Low. Like something he wasn't supposed to say.

Noel's breath caught.

"Yeah?"

Eben didn't know what he was asking.

Didn't know what he was offering.

Just knew that they were very close, and the tiny office was very quiet, and Noel was looking at him like—

Like he wanted—

Like he—

"I think," Eben said carefully, "that we should probably talk about this."

"Probably."

"Not right now."

"No."

"Tomorrow."

"Tomorrow."

Neither of them moved their hands.

The touching point burned like a brand.

And somewhere in the back of Eben's mind, a very rational voice was screaming that this was a terrible idea, that attachment was a structural weakness, that temporary meant temporary.

He ignored it.

He'd been ignoring it since the moment he'd walked through those doors and seen Noel Merrick smiling at chaos like it was his job.

Which, technically, it was.

"The papers," Noel said quietly.

"Right."

Eben pulled his hand back. Took the papers. Tried to remember how to breathe.

The moment passed.

But something had shifted.

Something that couldn't be unshifted.

And they both knew it.
