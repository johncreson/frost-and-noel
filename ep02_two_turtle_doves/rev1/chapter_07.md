# Chapter 7: The Kiss

**EBEN**

Their hands were still touching.

Just barely. Just fingertips brushing over papers that neither of them were actually reaching for anymore.

Eben should pull away.

Every rule he'd ever made for himself said *pull away*. Don't touch. Don't linger. Don't let yourself want things you can't keep.

He didn't pull away.

Noel didn't either.

The silence stretched between them. Loaded. Dangerous. The kind of silence that meant something was about to happen—something you couldn't take back.

Time slowed.

Or maybe Eben's perception of time had changed. Maybe this was what happened when you were about to do something irrevocable—the universe paused, gave you one last chance to reconsider.

He didn't want to reconsider.

That was the terrifying part.

Eben looked up.

Noel was already looking at him.

Their eyes met.

Held.

The tiny office felt impossibly small. The air between them felt impossibly charged. Eben could hear his own heartbeat, loud and fast, hammering against his ribs like it was trying to escape.

He could hear Noel breathing.

Shallow. Quick. Matching his own.

"Noel," he said.

The name came out quieter this time. Rougher. Like a question and a confession wrapped into one word.

First name. No distance. No formality.

Just Noel.

Noel's breath caught. His pupils dilated. His lips parted—just slightly, just enough—and Eben watched his throat move as he swallowed.

"Yeah?"

Whispered. Barely a sound.

Eben didn't know what he was asking.

Didn't know what he was offering.

Just knew that they were very close, and the room was very quiet, and Noel was looking at him like—

Like he wanted—

Like he—

**NOEL**

Noel didn't think.

If he'd thought, he would have stopped himself.

Would have remembered that this was temporary. That Eben was leaving in ten days. That wanting this was dangerous and stupid and guaranteed to end with Noel alone in an empty apartment, missing something he'd only just learned existed.

Would have remembered all the reasons this was a mistake.

Eben's eyes. Dark and steady and asking something Noel didn't have words for.

Eben's hand. Still touching his. Warm where Noel's was cold.

Eben's voice, saying *Noel* like it was something sacred.

All of it temporary.

All of it about to end.

But he didn't think.

Because thinking had never gotten him anywhere good. Thinking was what kept him awake at night, counting reasons why he wasn't enough. Thinking was what made him smile when he was falling apart.

Thinking was the enemy.

So he stopped.

He just leaned in.

Slowly.

So slowly.

Giving Eben time to pull away.

Giving himself time to change his mind.

Watching Eben's eyes—dark, uncertain, wanting—as the distance between them shrank.

Two inches.

One.

A breath.

They were still as stone.

And then Noel's lips touched Eben's, and thinking became impossible.

**DUAL**

The kiss was soft.

Questioning.

A brush of lips. A held breath. A moment of *is this okay? is this what you want?* answered without words.

Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's jaw. Gentle. Deliberate. Like Noel was something precious—something that could break if handled wrong.

His palm was warm. His fingers were steady. He held Noel like he was something worth being careful with.

Noel made a sound—small, surprised, something between a gasp and a sigh—and leaned closer.

The kiss deepened.

Became less soft.

Much less soft.

Noel's hand fisted in Eben's collar, pulling him closer, pulling him in. Eben's other hand found Noel's waist, fingers pressing through the fabric of his shirt, steadying them both.

The papers scattered off the desk. Neither of them noticed.

The laptop screens flickered. Neither of them cared.

There was only this.

Eben's mouth, warm and certain. Tasting like coffee and winter and something Noel couldn't name.

Noel's hands, desperate and demanding. Gripping like he could keep this if he just held on tight enough.

The sound of their breathing, the rustle of fabric, the soft wet sound of lips and tongues and need.

When they finally pulled apart, they were breathing hard.

Noel's eyes were wide. Stunned. Like he couldn't quite believe what had just happened.

Eben's hand was still on his jaw. His thumb traced a slow arc across Noel's cheekbone.

They stayed suspended. Frozen in the aftermath.

"Well," Eben said, after approximately seventeen years. "That happened."

Noel laughed. Breathless. Shaky. The sound broke something in the silence—not the tension, but the terrifying weight of it.

"Yeah," he said. "It did."

They stared at each other.

The tiny office felt even smaller now. Or maybe they felt larger. Maybe the world had contracted to just this moment, just this room, just the two of them.

"That was..." Noel started.

"Yes."

"I mean, really..."

"Yes."

"Are you just going to say 'yes' to everything?"

"Possibly." Eben's voice was rough. Wrecked. "I haven't recovered enough brain cells to form complete sentences."

Noel laughed again. It felt good. Felt real.

"We should—" Eben started.

"Yeah," Noel agreed.

Neither of them finished the sentence.

They stayed right where they were.

Eben's thumb brushed Noel's cheekbone again. Soft. Almost unconscious. Like he couldn't help himself.

Noel's breath hitched.

"Eben—"

"I know."

"We can't—"

"I know."

"This is—"

"I know."

Noel closed his eyes. Let out a shaky breath.

"Then why does it feel—"

"I don't know."

When Noel opened his eyes again, Eben was looking at him like he was something precious. Something breakable.

Something worth keeping.

Which was impossible. Because Eben didn't keep things. Eben left. That was the whole point.

But right now, in the dim light of the tiny office, with Eben's hand on his face and Eben's taste on his lips, nothing about that felt true.

"We should talk about this," Noel said.

"We should."

"Tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow."

It was a lie.

They both knew it was a lie.

But they nodded anyway. Like the promise meant something. Like they could postpone this conversation and everything would be fine.

Eben's hand dropped from Noel's jaw.

The loss of contact felt like a wound.

"It's late," Eben said.

"Yeah."

"You should go home."

"So should you."

For a long moment, they just stood there. Caught in the gravity of what had just happened.

Then, finally, they moved. Gathered their things. Put on their coats. Eben's hands still weren't quite steady. Noel's weren't either.
