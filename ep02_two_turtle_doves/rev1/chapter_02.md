# Chapter 2: The Room Problem

**NOEL**

Everhart Crafts was exactly what it sounded like: chaos in retail form.

The moment they stepped through the door, Noel was assaulted by sensory overload on a scale that could only be described as "aggressive festivity." Glitter drifted through the air like malevolent snow. Hot glue fumes wafted from somewhere in the back. Holiday music—Mariah Carey, naturally—blasted from speakers mounted at strategic intervals, creating a wall of sound that suggested surrender was the only option.

"Isn't it wonderful?" Hugh swept through the aisles like a king surveying his domain. Which, technically, he was. He'd owned Everhart Crafts for fifteen years, and every inch of it reflected his personality: bright, chaotic, and absolutely immune to the concept of "too much."

"It's something," Noel said.

Eben said nothing.

He stood just inside the doorway, perfectly still, surveying the store with the expression of a man who had just walked into his own personal nightmare and was trying to maintain composure through sheer force of will.

There was glitter on the floor. Glitter on the shelves. Glitter, Noel was fairly certain, in the actual air, suspended in the fluorescent light like tiny sparkling threats.

"Hugh," Eben said, his voice very calm. "There seems to be an infestation."

"Isn't it beautiful?" Hugh beamed. "Holiday magic!"

"That's one word for it."

Noel bit the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. Eben's horror was visible in the tiniest details—the slight flare of his nostrils, the way his hands had curled into fists at his sides, the micro-expression that suggested he was calculating exactly how much dry cleaning this was going to cost.

"Now!" Hugh spun to face them with the energy of a game show host about to reveal a prize. "While I grab the ribbon, you two can make yourselves useful!"

"Hugh, we really need to get back—"

But Hugh was already pressing something into Noel's hands. A craft kit. Cellophane-wrapped. With instructions printed on the back in cheerful fonts.

"It'll take five minutes," Hugh said. "Ten tops. And you'll have adorable matching ornaments!"

"We don't need matching ornaments," Eben said.

"Everyone needs matching ornaments." Hugh was already disappearing into the ribbon aisle, which appeared to contain approximately seven thousand spools in every color known to science. "I'll be right back!"

Noel looked at the craft kit. Looked at Eben.

Eben was staring at the kit like it had personally offended his ancestors.

"We don't have to—" Noel started.

"We're doing the craft," Eben said flatly.

"Really?"

"If we don't, he'll make us come back. He has that energy about him. The energy of someone who will absolutely hold a grudge about incomplete craft projects."

Fair point.

They found a workspace near the back of the store—a scarred wooden table surrounded by half-finished projects and what appeared to be the aftermath of a glitter explosion. There were scissors, glue guns still warm from recent use, and felt squares in every shade of red and green.

A handwritten sign on the wall read: "CRAFTING IS MANDATORY JOY."

Eben stared at it for a long moment.

"This is concerning," he said.

"This is Hugh," Noel replied. "Same thing."

He opened the craft kit. Instructions for making felt turtle doves. Complete with pre-cut patterns, embroidery thread, and a truly unnecessary amount of sequins.

Of course.

"Turtle doves," Noel said.

"Appropriate," Eben replied.

"For what?"

"Day two of twelve. 'Two turtle doves.' The song progression."

Noel blinked. "You know the twelve days of Christmas song progression?"

"I have a system for tracking festival themes."

"There is no festival theme system."

"There is now."

Noel stared at him. Eben picked up a piece of felt and a needle with the careful precision of someone defusing a bomb.

They worked in silence. Mariah wailed about all she wanted for Christmas. Glitter drifted down from the ceiling—Noel was increasingly convinced Hugh must have fans installed specifically for this purpose. A child somewhere in the store shrieked with what might have been joy or might have been overwhelm.

Noel tried to thread a needle. Failed. The thread frayed between his fingers like it was mocking him.

He tried again.

Failed again.

"Here," Eben said, and took the needle from him.

Their fingers brushed.

Both of them went very still.

Eben's hands were warm. That was the first thing Noel noticed. Warm, where his own were perpetually cold. Long fingers. Precise movements. The kind of hands that looked like they could fix anything.

Eben threaded the needle in one smooth motion. Handed it back. Didn't quite meet Noel's eyes.

"Thanks," Noel said quietly.

"You're welcome."

They returned to crafting.

Noel stitched with the enthusiasm of someone who had never successfully completed a craft project in his life. His turtle dove was developing a distinct lean. The wings were uneven. One eye was significantly higher than the other, giving it the appearance of a bird that had recently sustained a head injury.

Eben's turtle dove looked like it had been engineered by a team of professionals.

"How are you good at this?" Noel demanded.

"I'm good at following instructions." Eben held up his dove. It was symmetrical. The stitches were even. The sequin eye placement was geometrically perfect.

"It's felt. And thread. How is it perfect?"

"Practice."

"You practice making felt birds?"

"I practice precision. The medium is irrelevant."

Noel looked at his sad, lopsided dove. Looked at Eben's flawless creation.

"I hate you," he said.

"No, you don't."

The certainty in Eben's voice made Noel's chest do something dangerous.

Because he was right. Noel didn't hate him. That was becoming increasingly, inconveniently clear.

**EBEN**

This was a disaster.

Not the craft. The craft was fine. Simple. Logical. A series of steps leading to a predetermined outcome.

The disaster was everything else.

The disaster was that Eben had just said "No, you don't" with complete confidence, revealing something he absolutely should not have revealed, and Noel was looking at him like he'd said something important.

Which he had.

Damn it.

"Done!" Hugh reappeared with an armful of ribbon in seventeen shades of red. How he'd narrowed it down to seventeen was unclear. "Oh, you made the doves! They're perfect!"

"Mine's not perfect," Noel said.

"It's charming!" Hugh picked up Noel's lopsided dove and beamed at it like it was a masterpiece. "Eben's is perfect. Yours is charming. Together they're adorable. Like a matched set."

Eben wanted to argue. Wanted to point out that turtle doves had nothing to do with festival logistics. That they were wasting time. That Noel's cheeks had gone slightly pink at "matched set" and Eben was not going to think about what that meant.

But Noel was smiling. A real smile. Not the performer smile he wore for vendors and volunteers. The one that made his eyes crinkle at the corners.

"They are kind of cute," Noel admitted, turning his drunk-looking dove in his hands.

"You're keeping them," Hugh declared. "Consider them a gift. A symbol of your partnership!"

"Hugh—"

"A SYMBOL."

There was no arguing with that tone.

They paid for the ribbon—Hugh insisted, then insisted again when Eben tried to cover the cost—and escaped into the cold morning air.

Covered in glitter.

Eben looked at his coat. There were sparkles on his sleeve. On his cuff. On the lapel of what had been, until fifteen minutes ago, a spotlessly maintained charcoal wool blend. There were probably sparkles in his hair. There were definitely sparkles on his hands.

"It's everywhere," Noel said, brushing futilely at his own jacket. Each brush just redistributed the glitter to new locations. "How is it everywhere?"

"Glitter is eternal," Eben said. "It exists outside the normal laws of physics. It cannot be destroyed, only relocated."

"That's ominous."

"That's accurate."

Noel laughed. The sound caught Eben somewhere in the chest and lodged there.

They walked back to Merryweather Hall through streets that were already stirring with activity. Shopkeepers opening doors. Volunteers heading toward the square. The scent of fresh coffee drifting from the Garland Cup as they passed.

Hugh led them through the main hall—still swarming with craft committee members and their terrifying glitter reserves—and toward a door Eben hadn't noticed before.

"Your new office!" Hugh announced, flinging it open with theatrical flourish.

It was tiny.

Eben had seen closets with more square footage. He'd seen economy airplane bathrooms with more room to maneuver.

One desk. Two chairs. A filing cabinet wedged into the corner. A window approximately eighteen inches wide that looked out on the parking lot.

And approximately three feet of space between the chairs.

If they sat down, their knees would touch.

If they so much as leaned forward, they'd be sharing air.

"Cozy!" Hugh announced. "I'll leave you to it!"

He fled before either of them could protest.

Noel stood in the doorway. Stared at the room.

"This is..." Noel started.

"Inefficient," Eben finished.

"I was going to say 'intimate.'"

"That too."

They looked at each other.

Noel's hair still had glitter in it. Catching the light. Making him look like he'd been dusted with stars. There was a sparkle on his collar, too, and one on his cheekbone—a single fleck of silver that Eben could have brushed away if he reached out.

He didn't reach out.

He looked away.

"We should set up," he said.

"Right. Yes. Set up."

They arranged themselves with careful, awkward precision. Eben took the chair facing the window. Noel took the one facing the door. Their laptops on the single desk, screens angled away from each other like shields.

Their knees almost touched.

Almost.

Eben was hyperaware of the distance. Of how small it was. Of how easy it would be to close it. One shift forward. One inch.

He opened his laptop. Focused on the screen.

Tried very hard not to notice that Noel smelled like coffee and something warm—soap, maybe, or fabric softener—and that there was still glitter on his collar and that the tiny office felt like a confessional.

"This is fine," Noel said.

"It's fine," Eben agreed.

Neither of them sounded convinced.

They worked.

In the tiny office.

Very close.

For the whole day.

Eben told himself it would be fine. Told himself he could maintain professional distance even with three feet of air between them. Told himself the glitter on Noel's collar didn't matter, and the way Noel bit his lip when he concentrated didn't matter, and the faint smell of coffee and soap and something warm didn't matter.

He told himself a lot of things.

None of them were true.

This was going to be a problem.
