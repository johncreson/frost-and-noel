# Chapter 1: Morning Friction

Noel had spent all night not thinking about Eben Frost.

This required such an aggressive amount of not-thinking that he'd barely slept, which rather defeated the purpose.

He'd stared at his ceiling for hours. Counted sheep. Counted festival vendor applications. Counted all the reasons why yesterday had been perfectly normal and professional and absolutely not worth obsessing over.

Reason number one: Eben was a colleague. Colleagues made eye contact. That was normal.

Reason number two: Eben had said "temporary." Temporary meant nothing. It was just a word. Words didn't mean anything unless you let them.

Reason number three: The way Eben had looked at him in the parking lot—like Noel was a problem he couldn't solve—meant absolutely nothing. Professional assessment, that was all.

Reason number four: The coffee Eben had made was just coffee. Good coffee, but coffee nonetheless. It did not represent caring. It represented basic workplace courtesy.

Reason number five: Noel needed to stop making lists about a man he'd known for exactly one day.

Reason number six: Actually, that was the only real reason that mattered. Everything else was deflection. Very elaborate, very exhausting, completely pointless deflection.

The count of reasons had reached somewhere around four hundred and twelve when Noel had given up and made coffee at 4 AM.

His apartment was small. Efficient. The kind of place that suggested someone who didn't have time for decorating because he was too busy keeping an entire town's holiday season from collapsing. The only thing on the walls was a calendar that still showed November because Noel hadn't had thirty seconds to flip it.

Now, driving through the dark streets of Tinsel Town at 5:47 AM, Noel was running on spite, caffeine, and the desperate hope that today would be different.

Normal. Professional. Not weird.

The town passed by his windows in a blur of twinkle lights and wreaths. Every lamppost decorated. Every storefront glowing. Tinsel Town took its name seriously, and on December fifteenth, it looked like someone had dropped a Christmas catalog into a snow globe and shaken vigorously.

Noel pulled into the Merryweather Hall parking lot and immediately spotted Eben's car.

Already here.

Of course he was already here.

The rental was a sensible sedan, dark gray, parked in the spot closest to the door with geometric precision. Because of course Eben Frost would park geometrically.

Noel sat in his own slightly dented hatchback for a moment, gripping the steering wheel, and tried to remember how to be a normal human person who hadn't spent the entire night replaying the way Eben had said "temporary" like it hurt him.

"Professional," Noel whispered to the dashboard. "You can do professional."

The dashboard, wisely, did not respond.

He got out of the car.

The cold hit him like a slap—sharp, clean, smelling of pine and impending disaster. His breath fogged in the pre-dawn dark. Somewhere, a snowplow was grinding along Main Street.

The hall was warm when he entered. Lights on. Heat humming through the old radiators. And there, in the main planning room, was Eben Frost.

Working.

At 5:50 AM.

With fresh coffee brewing.

The scent hit Noel first—rich, dark, the kind of coffee that meant someone knew what they were doing. Not the burnt offering that came from the ancient pot Noel usually wrestled with.

Good coffee. Perfect coffee.

Noel stopped in the doorway.

Eben sat at the long table, laptop open, files arranged in neat stacks. He was wearing a charcoal sweater today—soft-looking, expensive. His hair was perfect. His posture was perfect. Everything about him was exactly as controlled as yesterday.

Except for the shadows under his eyes.

Faint, but visible. Like maybe he hadn't slept either.

Not that Noel was looking that closely.

Eben looked up.

Their gazes locked. The moment stretched—electric, unbearable—and neither of them seemed to remember how to breathe.

Then Eben said, "You're early."

"I'm on time," Noel corrected, crossing to the coffee maker because he needed something to do with his hands. Something that wasn't staring. "You're early."

"I'm on time. You're late."

"It's not even six yet."

"You usually arrive at 5:45."

Noel froze with his hand on a coffee mug—the blue one with the chipped handle that he always used. "How do you know that?"

"I pay attention."

The words sat between them like a confession.

Noel poured coffee. Tried to ignore the way his pulse had jumped. Tried very hard not to read into the fact that Eben had noticed his schedule. Had paid attention. Had apparently catalogued Noel's arrival time like it mattered.

People paid attention. It was normal. Professional.

He took a sip.

The coffee was perfect.

Rich and dark and exactly the right temperature, with just a hint of something almost sweet underneath—like Eben had somehow figured out that Noel took his coffee with the barest splash of cream.

Noel hated that it was perfect.

"You made coffee," he said.

"I did."

"You didn't have to do that."

"I was making it anyway."

"Right. Of course." Noel took another sip. "It's good."

"Thank you."

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. The radiator clanked. Outside, the snowplow finished its pass and the world went quiet.

Silence.

Noel stared at his coffee. Eben returned to his laptop. The space between them felt very large and very small at the same time.

This was fine.

This was normal.

This was absolutely excruciating.

"So," Noel said finally. "Today's schedule."

"I updated it." Eben didn't look up. His fingers moved across the keyboard with that same precise, measured quality he brought to everything. "The vendor check-ins are at nine. Volunteer briefing at ten. Equipment inspection at eleven."

"You updated the schedule."

"You were going to do it this morning. I did it last night."

"When last night?"

"After I left."

After he left. After they'd said goodnight in the parking lot. After Noel had driven home and not slept and thought about Eben for eight straight hours.

Eben had gone home and updated the schedule.

"That's very..." Noel searched for a word. "Efficient."

"Thank you."

"I wasn't sure it was a compliment."

Eben's mouth twitched. The barest movement. Almost a smile.

"I'll take it as one anyway."

Noel's chest did something complicated. A flutter. A squeeze. The kind of internal earthquake that happened when someone unexpected did something unexpectedly kind.

He sat down across from Eben. Pulled out his own laptop. Tried to focus on the screen and not on the fact that Eben was three feet away, looking unfairly put-together for someone who'd also probably not slept.

"Did you sleep?" Noel asked before he could stop himself.

Eben's fingers paused on his keyboard. "Some."

"How much is some?"

"Enough."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the answer you're getting."

Noel looked at him. Really looked.

The shadows were definitely there. And there was something in the set of Eben's jaw—tight, controlled—that suggested he was working very hard to maintain his composure.

"You didn't sleep either," Noel said quietly.

"I slept enough."

"Eben—"

"We have work to do."

The deflection was so obvious it hurt.

Noel let it go. Because what was he supposed to say? *Did you also spend all night thinking about me? About yesterday? About the way you said 'temporary' like you were trying to convince yourself?*

He couldn't say any of that.

So he said, "Right. Work."

They worked.

In silence that felt like holding breath.

The coffee was still perfect.

Noel still hated it.

An hour passed. The hall started to wake up around them. Volunteers arriving. Vendors setting up. The familiar chaos of festival preparation filtering through the building like a rising tide.

Noel threw himself into it. Solved problems. Directed people. Smiled until his face hurt.

And tried very, very hard not to notice every time Eben looked at him.

Which was often.

Too often.

Every time Noel glanced up, Eben was watching. Not obviously—nothing so crass as staring—but with that quiet, analytical focus that made Noel feel like something being catalogued.

He should have hated it.

He didn't.

Noel was in the middle of explaining booth placement to a confused vendor—"No, Mrs. Henderson, the wreath station can't be next to the candle booth, fire hazard"—when Hugh Everhart burst through the main doors like a glittery tornado.

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice carried across the entire hall. Every head turned. "CRISIS!"

Noel excused himself from Mrs. Henderson. "What kind of crisis?"

"The best kind!" Hugh beamed, silver tinsel cape swirling behind him. "The kind where I have good news and bad news!"

"Hit me with the bad news first."

"The main planning room is unavailable today."

Noel blinked. "What?"

"My craft committee booked it three months ago! I completely forgot to tell you! We're having a glitter emergency!"

"A glitter emergency."

"The most serious kind of emergency."

"Hugh—"

"But the good news!" Hugh grabbed his arm with the enthusiasm of someone announcing a lottery win. "You can use the backup office! It's cozy!"

"How cozy?"

"Very cozy. Intimately cozy." Hugh's eyes sparkled with something that looked dangerously like matchmaking. "You and Mr. Frost will be very close. For the whole day."

Noel's stomach dropped. "Hugh—"

"Also, you need to come to Everhart Crafts with me right now. I need your opinion on ribbon."

"I don't have time for—"

"It'll be quick! Five minutes! Mr. Frost can come too!" Hugh was already pulling him toward the door. "EBEN! WE'RE GOING ON A FIELD TRIP!"

Eben looked up from his laptop. Saw Hugh. Saw Noel being dragged.

His expression did something that might have been resignation. Or possibly horror.

"Do I have a choice?" Eben asked.

"Absolutely not!" Hugh declared. "Come along! We have crafts to discuss!"

Noel caught Eben's eye. Tried to communicate an apology through sheer telepathy.

Eben stood. Put on his coat. One deliberate movement at a time, like armor being donned for battle.

"This should be interesting," Eben said.

And Noel, watching Hugh bounce excitedly toward the door, knew with absolute certainty that today was going to be anything but normal.
