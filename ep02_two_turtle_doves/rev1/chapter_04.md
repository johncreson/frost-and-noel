# Chapter 4: The Town Interrupts

**NOEL**

Noel needed coffee.

This was not a want. This was a physiological requirement. His bloodstream was now more caffeine than hemoglobin, and if he didn't maintain the ratio, he was fairly certain his body would simply shut down in protest.

Also, he needed to get out of that tiny office.

Because Eben Frost had just said "you're good at this" like it meant something, and Noel had no idea what to do with that information except flee.

"Garland Cup?" he asked, standing in the office doorway. "I need a refill."

Eben looked up from his laptop. His expression was carefully neutral—the same controlled composure he always wore—but there was something in his eyes. Something that looked almost like concern.

"It's your fifth cup today."

"I'm not counting."

"I am."

Of course he was.

"Come with me," Noel said. "You need a break too."

"I'm fine."

"You've been staring at that spreadsheet for an hour. Your eyes are going to merge with the screen."

Eben's mouth twitched. "That's not how biology works."

"That's how this festival works. Everything here operates on slightly different physics. Haven't you noticed?"

A pause.

Then Eben stood. Closed his laptop. Put on his coat with those same deliberate, precise movements—one arm, then the other, then a slight adjustment of the collar.

"Ten minutes," he said.

"Fifteen."

"Twelve."

"Deal."

They walked out into the December air.

Tinsel Town in mid-morning was a different creature than Tinsel Town at dawn. The streets were crowded now—volunteers hauling decorations, shopkeepers chatting on sidewalks, tourists taking photos of every available surface. Someone had set up a brass quartet on the corner of Main and Holly, and "O Holy Night" drifted through the cold.

The smell of pine was everywhere. Wreaths on every door. Garlands wrapped around every lamppost. A child ran past clutching a candy cane, followed by a harried parent apologizing to anyone in their path.

Eben walked beside him.

Close.

Closer than strictly necessary, given the width of the sidewalk.

Their shoulders almost brushed.

Noel was acutely aware of every inch of space between them. Of the way Eben's coat moved when he walked. Of the faint scent of his cologne—something clean and dark, barely there but impossible to ignore.

"The town is... committed," Eben observed.

"That's one word for it."

"I was trying to be diplomatic."

"Try harder. 'Aggressively festive' is the preferred local terminology."

"Does it get exhausting? Being surrounded by this much... cheer?"

Noel considered the question. "Sometimes. But it's also kind of wonderful. Everyone here really believes in it. The magic, the community, the whole absurd Christmas thing. It's genuine."

"That's rare."

"That's Tinsel Town."

They passed the hardware store—wreath still enormous, lights still blinding—and Mr. Hendricks emerged to wave enthusiastically. "Noel! Bring your friend to cocoa night! Thursday at seven!"

"We'll see, Mr. Hendricks!"

"That wasn't optional, son!"

Noel caught Eben's expression—something between bewilderment and amusement.

"Cocoa night?" Eben asked.

"Don't ask."

Mrs. Patterson appeared in her bakery window and gave them a thumbs-up so aggressive it was practically a threat. An elderly man on a bench actually applauded as they passed.

Noel pretended not to see any of it.

The Garland Cup was warm and bright and smelled like heaven.

Coffee and cinnamon and fresh-baked something. The kind of smell that made you want to sink into a chair and never leave. Wes was behind the counter, as always, wearing an apron that read "I Run on Caffeine and Christmas Spirit."

"Well, well," Wes said, grinning as they approached. "Look who's emerged from the tiny office."

"News travels fast," Noel muttered.

"Hugh texted the group chat. With photos."

"There's a group chat?"

"There's always a group chat." Wes's eyes slid to Eben with open curiosity. "And you must be the logistics consultant I've heard so much about. Welcome to Tinsel Town's finest establishment."

"Thank you," Eben said, with the careful politeness of someone who had been raised to respond graciously to strangers even when slightly confused.

"You two look cozy," Wes continued, leaning on the counter with the air of someone settling in for good gossip. "Spending all day in that little office together. Just the two of you. Very... intimate."

"We're working," Noel said.

Wes nodded sagely. "Uh-huh."

"Professionally."

"Absolutely."

"On the festival."

"Sure."

Noel was going to kill him. Right here in the coffee shop. It would be messy and public but completely justified.

"The usual?" Wes asked, already reaching for a cup.

Before Noel could answer, Eben spoke.

"Large oat milk latte with one pump of vanilla and a quarter shot of espresso on top."

Noel blinked.

Wes blinked.

Eben's expression remained perfectly neutral.

"That's..." Noel started. "That's exactly my order."

"Yes."

"How did you know my order?"

"You mentioned it. Yesterday."

"I didn't mention it yesterday."

"Then I must be intuitive."

Wes was looking between them with the expression of someone watching a nature documentary. His eyes had gone bright with interest.

"Well," Wes said slowly. "Isn't that something."

Noel's face was warm. Too warm. He could feel the heat creeping up his neck.

Eben had remembered his coffee order. Not just remembered it—memorized it to the precise specifications. The oat milk. The vanilla. The quarter shot that Noel always felt pretentious ordering but couldn't give up because it made everything taste better.

He'd paid attention.

*Why does that matter? Why does everything he does feel like it matters?*

"And for you?" Wes asked Eben.

"Black coffee. Large."

"Of course it is." Wes shook his head. "You two are adorable."

"We're not—"

"Adorable," Noel agreed flatly. "That's definitely the word."

They waited for their drinks in a silence that felt charged. The brass quartet outside had switched to "The First Noel," which seemed unnecessarily pointed given the circumstances.

An elderly woman at a nearby table leaned over. "Excuse me, dear, but are you Noel Merrick? The festival coordinator?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Oh, wonderful!" She beamed at him, then at Eben, then back. "And is this your young man? It's so nice to see young people getting along these days. Everyone's always on their phones, but you two actually talk to each other!"

"He's not my—"

"We work together," Eben said.

"That's how it starts!" The woman winked. "My Harold and I worked together for ten years before he finally got up the nerve. Best decision he ever made."

She returned to her scone with the satisfied air of someone who had imparted wisdom.

Noel wanted to scream.

"That happens a lot here," he muttered to Eben.

"What does?"

"The assumption. The matchmaking. Everyone in this town thinks they're a relationship expert."

Eben accepted his black coffee from Wes. Took a sip. "It must be exhausting."

"You have no idea."

Their eyes met.

Held.

Something passed between them—something electric and terrifying and completely undefined.

"We should get back," Noel said.

"Yes."

They stood there. Caught.

The brass quartet played on. The coffee shop buzzed with warmth and conversation. Outside, snow had started to fall in soft, lazy spirals.

"The tiny office awaits," Noel said finally.

"Unfortunately."

They walked back.

Together.

Their shoulders brushing.

And Noel tried very hard not to think about the fact that Eben had known his coffee order, and why that single detail felt more intimate than anything that had happened in the last twenty-four hours.
