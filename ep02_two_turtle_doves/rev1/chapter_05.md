# Chapter 5: Late Night Work

**NOEL**

The hall emptied around them like a tide going out.

First the volunteers, trickling away in twos and threes, waving goodnight through the office window. Then the vendors, packing up samples and closing down booths. Then the cleaning crew, whose arrival Noel always missed and whose departure he was never certain about.

By nine o'clock, the building was silent.

By ten, the silence had become its own presence.

Noel sat at his end of the tiny desk, laptop glow illuminating his face, and listened to Eben breathe.

That was the thing about this room. It was so small that he could hear everything. The click of Eben's keyboard. The soft tap of his fingers on the desk when he was thinking. The slight rustle of fabric when he shifted in his chair.

The slow, steady rhythm of his breathing.

In. Out. In. Out.

It was... something. Intimate. That was the word Noel had been avoiding all day, but there was no getting around it now. Sitting three feet apart in the dark, lit only by laptop screens, hearing each other breathe—this was intimate.

More intimate than coffee. More intimate than crafts. More intimate than all the accidental touches and loaded silences of the past twelve hours.

This was something else entirely.

Noel tried to focus on his laptop. Vendor spreadsheet. Payment schedules. Numbers that should mean something.

They didn't mean anything.

All he could think about was the shape of Eben in his peripheral vision. The way his shoulders moved when he typed. The way his jaw was set—tight, controlled, like he was holding something back.

What was he holding back?

What were either of them holding back?

The building creaked around them. Old bones settling into the cold. Somewhere deep in the walls, a pipe groaned—a long, low sound that seemed to come from everywhere at once. The radiator in the corner clanked and hissed, fighting its eternal battle against the December air.

Outside, the wind picked up. Snow scratched against the window like fingernails. The parking lot lights flickered once, twice, then steadied.

"You should go home."

Eben's voice cut through the quiet like a blade.

Noel looked up. "What?"

"It's late. You should rest."

"You're still here."

"That's different."

"How is that different?"

Eben didn't answer.

Outside the window, snow fell in lazy spirals, catching the parking lot lights. From somewhere far away, Noel could hear the brass quartet packing up—the click of instrument cases, a muffled laugh, a car door slamming.

The town settling into sleep.

Everyone going home.

Everyone except them.

"I'm fine," Noel said.

"You're exhausted."

"I'm always exhausted. It's a lifestyle choice."

"That's not a lifestyle. That's self-destruction with better branding."

Noel stared at him.

Eben stared back.

His eyes were very dark in the dim light. The laptop glow caught the planes of his face, the sharp cut of his jaw, the careful neutrality of his expression that Noel was beginning to suspect was anything but neutral.

"That's a bit dramatic," Noel said.

"That's accurate."

"You don't know how I operate."

"I know you haven't slept properly since I arrived. I know you drink coffee instead of eating. I know you smile when you're falling apart because you think no one will notice."

The words landed like blows.

Noel's throat went tight.

"You noticed," he said quietly.

"Yes."

"Why do you care?"

Eben's fingers stopped moving. The keyboard went silent. For a long moment, the only sound was the snow against the window and the ancient radiator clanking its complaint.

"I don't know," Eben said finally. "That's the problem."

The honesty hit Noel somewhere in the chest. A bloom of warmth. A flutter of something dangerous.

He should change the subject. Should redirect to schedules, logistics, safe territory. Should do literally anything except sit here in the dark, too close, too aware, feeling the space between them like a physical pressure.

Instead, he said, "The glitter's still on your collar."

Eben looked down. There, on the charcoal wool, a single fleck of silver caught the light.

"Yours too," Eben said.

Noel reached up. Touched his own collar. Found the sparkle.

Neither of them had tried to wash it off.

*What does that mean?*

*Stop asking what things mean.*

He caught himself staring at Eben's hands. Long fingers. Resting on the keyboard. The hands of someone precise and careful, someone who fixed things and controlled things and held everything at arm's length.

Except right now, those hands weren't moving. They were still. Waiting.

The hands that had threaded his needle that morning. That had handed him coffee. That had, for one brief moment in the craft store, brushed against his own.

"We should keep working," Noel said.

"Yes."

But they stayed frozen. Neither willing to be the first to break the spell.

*Temporary*, Noel reminded himself. *This is temporary. He's leaving in ten days.*

The word felt less like a wall now and more like a countdown.

The snow kept falling. The building kept creaking. The tiny office felt like the entire world, contracted to this single point of warmth in the darkness.

Noel's phone buzzed.

He grabbed it like a lifeline.

**Wes:** *You're still at the hall, aren't you?*

**Noel:** *How do you know that?*

**Wes:** *I can see the office light from my apartment. It's the only one still on.*

**Wes:** *Go home, Noel.*

**Noel:** *Soon.*

**Wes:** *Define soon.*

**Noel:** *Eventually.*

**Wes:** *That's not a definition. That's evasion.*

**Wes:** *Is Eben still there too?*

Noel glanced at Eben, who was watching him with an unreadable expression.

**Noel:** *Yes.*

**Wes:** *Interesting.*

**Noel:** *Shut up.*

**Wes:** *I didn't say anything.*

**Noel:** *You were thinking it.*

**Wes:** *Loudly.*

**Wes:** *For the record, I like him.*

**Noel:** *You've met him once.*

**Wes:** *That's enough. He looks at you like you're a puzzle he wants to solve.*

**Noel:** *That's weird.*

**Wes:** *That's romantic. There's a difference.*

**Noel:** *Go to bed, Wes.*

**Wes:** *You first. 💚*

Noel put his phone face-down on the desk.

"Everything okay?" Eben asked.

"Wes being Wes."

"What does being Wes entail?"

"Being nosy. Being insufferable. Being right about things I don't want him to be right about."

"What things?"

Their eyes met.

Held.

*You,* Noel didn't say. *You and me and whatever this is. The thing I can't name. The thing I'm not supposed to want.*

"Nothing," he said instead. "Just Wes things."

Eben nodded. Didn't push.

The silence returned. Heavy. Waiting.

Noel pulled his laptop closer. Tried to focus on the screen. On schedules and logistics and things that made sense.

But his awareness kept drifting. To the sound of Eben's breathing. To the space between them. To the glitter on both their collars that neither of them had washed away.

Intimate.

That was definitely the word.

And Noel had no idea what to do with it.

Except that wasn't quite true.

He knew exactly what he wanted to do.

He just wasn't brave enough to do it.

Not yet.
