# Chapter 3: Competence Tension

**EBEN**

The room was approximately the size of a confession booth, which felt appropriate given what Eben was about to admit to himself.

He was watching Noel.

Not professionally. Not as part of any legitimate logistics assessment. Just... watching.

Noel worked with the kind of focused intensity that suggested he'd forgotten Eben was there. His laptop glowed in the dim office light, casting blue shadows across his face. His fingers moved across the keyboard in bursts—typing, pausing, typing again.

He bit his lower lip when he was thinking.

Eben noticed that.

He noticed a lot of things.

The tired lines around Noel's eyes—faint but visible, like cracks in plaster. The way his hair had started to fall across his forehead as the morning wore on, a dark curl that he kept pushing back absently. The slight tremor in his hands when he reached for his coffee—the fourth cup today, by Eben's count, and it wasn't even noon.

He noticed the way Noel's fingers wrapped around the mug. Long fingers. Elegant, almost. With chapped knuckles and a faint ink stain on his right thumb.

He noticed the way Noel laughed at nothing. Not out loud, just a small exhale, a quirk of his lips, like something on his screen had amused him. Like he was having a private joke with himself.

*Stop,* Eben told himself firmly. *This is not your concern.*

He returned his attention to his laptop. Spreadsheet. Vendor schedules. Things that made sense. Things that didn't make his chest feel strange and tight.

The numbers blurred.

He was thinking about the way Noel had looked at the craft store—frustrated with his lopsided turtle dove, laughing at his own incompetence. Real laughter. Not the performance smile he gave to vendors.

He was thinking about the glitter still on Noel's collar.

He was thinking about the way Noel had said "I hate you" in a voice that meant the opposite.

He was thinking about things he had no business thinking about.

Things like what Noel's hair would look like in the morning. Things like whether Noel always worked this hard, or if this was performance for Eben's benefit. Things like what it would take to make Noel actually rest—to make him believe he was worth resting for.

*Stop.*

*This is temporary.*

*This is a job.*

*He is a colleague.*

The words felt hollow even as he thought them.

Three feet away, Noel shifted in his chair.

The movement was small. Just a slight adjustment of his position. But in this room—this impossibly tiny room—it felt enormous. Eben could feel the air displacement. Could smell coffee and something warm underneath—soap, maybe, or the detergent that clung to Noel's sweater.

Could hear Noel breathe.

The scent of old books drifted from the filing cabinet. Dust motes floated in the thin light from the window. The radiator clanked its ancient complaint.

*Focus.*

He typed something. Couldn't remember what he'd typed. Backspaced.

"You're staring."

Eben's hands froze on the keyboard.

Noel hadn't looked up from his screen. His voice was casual, almost amused.

"I'm not staring."

"You keep looking at me." Now Noel did look up. His eyes—too blue, Eben had decided, unfairly blue—met Eben's across the tiny space. "Every few minutes. I can see you in my peripheral vision."

"I'm observing."

"Observing what?"

"Working patterns. For the sake of efficiency."

"You're observing my working patterns."

"Yes."

"And what have you observed?"

*That you bite your lip when you're thinking. That you drink too much coffee. That you laugh at nothing and it makes me want to know what's funny. That your hands shake when you're tired and you try to hide it. That you look exhausted and I want to tell you to rest and I have no right to want that.*

"That you're competent," Eben said instead.

Something flickered across Noel's face. Surprise, maybe. Or something closer to wonder.

"What?"

"You're good at this." The words came out before Eben could stop them. "The festival. The coordination. Handling the chaos. You're good at it."

Noel went very still.

The room felt smaller somehow. The air felt thicker. The space between them—three feet, maybe less—seemed to vibrate with something unspoken.

"That's..." Noel started. Stopped. Started again. "That's not what people usually say about me."

"What do people usually say?"

"That I'm helpful. Reliable. Good at solving problems." Noel's voice had gone quiet. Careful. "Not that I'm... good at this. Just that I'm good at being useful."

Eben looked at him.

Looked properly. Not observing. Just... seeing.

Noel Merrick, who held this entire festival together with spite and caffeine. Who smiled when he was exhausted. Who worked at 5 AM and probably 10 PM and never stopped because stopping meant admitting he needed something.

Who thought being useful was the same as being valued.

"Those aren't the same thing," Eben said.

"What?"

"Being useful and being good at something. They're different qualities."

Noel's breath caught. "Are they?"

"Yes." Eben held his gaze. "You're both. But the second one matters more."

The silence stretched.

One breath. Two.

Noel's throat moved as he swallowed.

The moment hung between them. Fragile. Dangerous.

"You should go home," Eben said quietly. "Get some rest."

"You're still here."

"That's different."

"How is it different?"

Eben didn't have an answer. Or he had too many answers, and none of them were ones he could say.

*Because I don't matter. Because I don't have anyone waiting for me. Because sleep is just another empty room in another empty apartment, and being here—even in this closet-sized office—feels less empty than that.*

"It just is," he said.

Noel's expression softened. "That's not an answer."

"It's the one you're getting."

A knock on the door made them both jump.

"Guys!" One of the volunteers—a young woman with a clipboard and a truly alarming amount of tinsel in her hair—stuck her head in. "Sorry to interrupt, but we need a decision on the cocoa station placement!"

Noel blinked. Seemed to come back from somewhere far away.

"Right. Yes. The cocoa station." He stood, his chair scraping against the floor. "I'll be right there."

The volunteer disappeared.

Noel looked at Eben.

Something passed between them. Something Eben couldn't name and didn't want to examine.

"Coffee break after?" Noel asked.

"Yes."

Noel nodded. Left.

The room felt very empty without him.

Eben sat in the silence and stared at his laptop screen. The cursor blinked at him. Accusatory. Knowing.

*What are you doing?*

He didn't have an answer.

But for the first time in years, maybe he wanted one.
