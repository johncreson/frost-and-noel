# Chapter 5: Late Night Work

The hall had emptied hours ago.

Noel knew this because he'd watched it happen. Volunteers leaving. Vendors packing up. Hugh departing in a cloud of glitter and cheerful goodbyes.

And still, neither he nor Eben had suggested leaving.

It was past nine PM now. The tiny office felt even smaller in the darkness, lit only by their laptop screens and the parking lot lights filtering through the window.

They should go home.

Noel knew they should go home.

He didn't move.

"You should go home," Eben said, not looking up from his screen.

"You're still here."

"That's different."

"How is that different?"

Eben's fingers paused on his keyboard. "It just is."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the answer you're getting."

Noel leaned back in his chair. Stretched. His back protested—they'd been sitting too long.

"We've been here for fifteen hours," Noel said.

"Fourteen and a half."

"You're counting?"

"I'm always counting."

"That sounds exhausting."

"It's efficient."

"It's the same thing."

Eben looked up. Their eyes met in the dim light.

"You're tired," Eben said.

"So are you."

"I'm functional."

"You're running on spite and coffee."

"So are you."

Noel laughed. Quiet. Tired. Real.

"We're a mess," he said.

"We're functional."

"Barely."

"Barely is enough."

Noel studied him. Eben's face was shadowed in the laptop light. The glitter was still visible on his collar—they'd both given up trying to remove it hours ago.

"Why are you still here?" Noel asked.

"I could ask you the same thing."

"I asked first."

Eben was quiet for a long moment. Then: "I don't know."

The honesty surprised them both.

"That's not like you," Noel said.

"What's not like me?"

"Not knowing. You always know. You're the most certain person I've ever met."

"I'm the most controlled person you've ever met. That's different."

"Is it?"

"Yes." Eben closed his laptop. Looked at Noel directly. "Control is a choice. Certainty is a feeling. I choose control because I don't trust feelings."

"Why not?"

"Because feelings change. People leave. Control is the only thing that stays."

The words hung in the tiny office like a confession.

Noel's chest ached.

"That sounds lonely," he said quietly.

"It's safe."

"It's the same thing."

Eben's expression flickered. "Maybe."

They sat in silence. The building creaked around them. Snow tapped against the window.

Intimate, Noel thought. That was the word he'd been avoiding all day.

This felt intimate.

"I'm still here," Noel said, "because I don't want to leave."

Eben went very still. "Why not?"

"Because when I leave, I'll go home. And I'll be alone. And I'll think about—" He stopped.

"About what?"

About you, Noel thought. About yesterday. About the way you said 'temporary' like it hurt. About the way you knew my coffee order. About the way you look at me like I matter.

"About work," he said instead.

Eben's expression said he didn't believe him.

"Liar," Eben said softly.

"You're one to talk."

"I never claimed otherwise."

"So we're both liars."

"Apparently."

"What are we lying about?"

Eben held his gaze. "You tell me."

Noel's pulse jumped.

This was dangerous. This conversation. This moment. This tiny office where they'd spent fifteen hours—fourteen and a half—pretending they weren't aware of each other.

"We should go home," Noel said.

"We should."

Neither of them moved.

The glitter on Eben's collar caught the light.

Noel looked away.

"Tomorrow," he said.

"Tomorrow," Eben agreed.

But still, neither of them moved.

And Noel knew, sitting in the tiny office with Eben Frost three feet away, that something was going to break.

Soon.

Maybe tonight.

Maybe right now.

He just didn't know if he was ready for it.
