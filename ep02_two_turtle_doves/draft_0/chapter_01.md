# Chapter 1: Morning Friction

Noel had spent all night not thinking about Eben Frost.

This required such an aggressive amount of not-thinking that he'd barely slept, which rather defeated the purpose.

He'd stared at his ceiling for hours. Counted sheep. Counted festival tasks. Counted all the reasons why yesterday had been perfectly normal and professional and absolutely not worth obsessing over.

The count had reached somewhere around four hundred and twelve when he'd given up and made coffee at 4 AM.

Now, driving through the dark streets of Tinsel Town at 5:47 AM, Noel was running on spite, caffeine, and the desperate hope that today would be different.

Normal. Professional. Not weird.

He pulled into the Merryweather Hall parking lot and immediately spotted Eben's car.

Already here.

Of course he was already here.

Noel sat in his car for a moment, gripping the steering wheel, and tried to remember how to be a normal human person who hadn't spent the entire night replaying the way Eben had said "temporary" like it hurt him.

Professional. He could do professional.

He got out of the car.

The hall was warm when he entered. Lights on. And there, in the main planning room, was Eben Frost.

Working.

At 5:50 AM.

With fresh coffee brewing.

Noel stopped in the doorway.

Eben looked up. Their eyes met.

For one terrible, wonderful moment, neither of them moved.

Then Eben said, "You're early."

"I'm on time," Noel corrected, crossing to the coffee maker. "You're early."

"I'm on time. You're late."

"It's not even six yet."

"You usually arrive at 5:45."

Noel froze with his hand on a coffee mug. "How do you know that?"

"I pay attention."

The words sat between them like a confession.

Noel poured coffee. Tried to ignore the way his pulse had jumped. Tried very hard not to read into the fact that Eben had noticed his schedule. Had paid attention.

People paid attention. It was normal. Professional.

The coffee was perfect.

Noel hated that it was perfect.

"You made coffee," he said.

"I did."

"You didn't have to do that."

"I was making it anyway."

"Right. Of course." Noel took a sip. "It's good."

"Thank you."

Silence.

Noel stared at his coffee. Eben returned to his laptop. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead.

This was fine.

This was normal.

This was absolutely excruciating.

"So," Noel said finally. "Today's schedule."

"I updated it," Eben said, not looking up. "The vendor check-ins are at nine. Volunteer briefing at ten. Equipment inspection at eleven."

"You updated the schedule."

"You were going to do it this morning. I did it last night."

"When last night?"

"After I left."

After he left. After they'd said goodnight in the parking lot. After Noel had driven home and not slept and thought about Eben for eight straight hours.

Eben had gone home and updated the schedule.

"That's very..." Noel searched for a word. "Efficient."

"Thank you."

"I wasn't sure it was a compliment."

Eben's mouth twitched. Almost a smile. "I'll take it as one anyway."

Noel's chest did something complicated.

He sat down. Pulled out his own laptop. Tried to focus on the screen and not on the fact that Eben was three feet away, looking unfairly put-together for someone who'd also probably not slept.

"Did you sleep?" Noel asked before he could stop himself.

Eben's fingers paused on his keyboard. "Some."

"How much is some?"

"Enough."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the answer you're getting."

Noel looked at him. Eben looked back.

There were shadows under Eben's eyes. Faint, but visible. His hair was perfect as always, his shirt pressed, his expression controlled.

But the shadows were there.

"You didn't sleep either," Noel said quietly.

"I slept enough."

"Eben—"

"We have work to do."

The deflection was so obvious it hurt.

Noel let it go. Because what was he supposed to say? *Did you also spend all night thinking about me? About yesterday? About the way you said 'temporary' like you were trying to convince yourself?*

He couldn't say any of that.

So he said, "Right. Work."

They worked.

In silence.

The coffee was still perfect.

Noel still hated it.

An hour passed. The hall started to wake up around them. Volunteers arriving. Vendors setting up. The familiar chaos of festival preparation.

Noel threw himself into it. Solved problems. Directed people. Smiled until his face hurt.

And tried very, very hard not to notice every time Eben looked at him.

Which was often.

Too often.

Noel was in the middle of explaining booth placement to a confused vendor when Hugh Everhart burst through the main doors like a glittery tornado.

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice carried across the entire hall. "CRISIS!"

Noel excused himself from the vendor. "What kind of crisis?"

"The best kind!" Hugh beamed. "The kind where I have good news and bad news!"

"Hit me with the bad news first."

"The main planning room is unavailable today."

Noel blinked. "What?"

"My craft committee booked it three months ago! I completely forgot to tell you! We're having a glitter emergency!"

"A glitter emergency."

"The most serious kind of emergency."

"Hugh—"

"But the good news!" Hugh grabbed his arm. "You can use the backup office! It's cozy!"

"How cozy?"

"Very cozy. Intimately cozy. You and Mr. Frost will be very close. For the whole day."

Noel's stomach dropped. "Hugh—"

"Also, you need to come to Everhart Crafts with me right now. I need your opinion on ribbon."

"I don't have time for—"

"It'll be quick! Five minutes! Mr. Frost can come too!" Hugh was already pulling him toward the door. "EBEN! WE'RE GOING ON A FIELD TRIP!"

Eben looked up from his laptop. Saw Hugh. Saw Noel being dragged. 

His expression did something that might have been resignation.

"Do I have a choice?" Eben asked.

"Absolutely not!" Hugh declared. "Come along! We have crafts to discuss!"

Noel caught Eben's eye.

Eben stood. Put on his coat. One deliberate movement at a time.

"This should be interesting," Eben said.

And Noel, watching Hugh bounce excitedly toward the door, knew with absolute certainty that today was going to be anything but normal.
