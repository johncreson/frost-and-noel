# Chapter 4: The Town Interrupts

They needed coffee.

Noel had been staring at the same spreadsheet for twenty minutes, and the numbers were starting to blur together in ways that suggested either a migraine or a complete mental breakdown.

Possibly both.

"Coffee," he announced.

Eben looked up. "What?"

"We need coffee. I need coffee. Do you need coffee?"

"I always need coffee."

"Great. Let's go."

They stood simultaneously. The tiny office made the movement awkward—Noel's chair hit the filing cabinet, Eben had to step sideways to avoid the desk.

They ended up very close.

Close enough that Noel could see the glitter still dusted on Eben's collar.

Close enough to smell whatever clean, winter scent Eben used.

Close enough to be dangerous.

"Sorry," Noel said, stepping back.

"It's fine."

They escaped the office like it was on fire.

The walk to Garland Cup was quiet. Snow had started falling again—soft, gentle flakes that made Tinsel Town look like a postcard.

Noel tried to focus on the snow. On the decorations. On literally anything except the fact that Eben was walking beside him, close enough that their arms almost brushed.

The coffee shop was warm and crowded. Wes was behind the counter, and his face lit up the moment he saw them.

"Well, well," Wes said. "The dynamic duo."

"We need coffee," Noel said.

"You always need coffee." Wes leaned on the counter. "You two look cozy."

"We're working."

"In the tiny backup office, I heard."

"How did you—"

"Hugh texted me. With photos. Of you making crafts."

Noel closed his eyes. "Of course he did."

"The turtle doves are very cute."

"I'm going to kill Hugh."

"Get in line." Wes turned to Eben. "What can I get you?"

Eben didn't hesitate. "Large americano, three shots, oat milk, two sugars."

Noel froze.

That was his order.

Exactly his order.

"How did you know that?" Noel asked.

Eben didn't look at him. "You mentioned it yesterday."

"I didn't."

"You must have."

"I didn't."

Wes was grinning. "He pays attention. It's sweet."

"It's observant," Eben corrected.

"Same thing."

"It's really not."

Wes made their drinks, still grinning like he knew something they didn't.

Which he probably did. Wes knew everything.

"Here you go," Wes said, handing over the cups. "On the house."

"You don't have to—" Noel started.

"Consider it a thank you. For making this festival happen. And for being adorable."

"We're not adorable," Eben said.

"You're covered in glitter and ordering each other's coffee. You're adorable."

Noel wanted to argue. Wanted to point out that they were professionals. Colleagues. Temporary partners.

But Eben had known his coffee order.

Had paid attention.

Why does that matter? Noel thought desperately. Why does everything he does feel like it matters?

They left the coffee shop. The snow was falling harder now.

"He's going to tell everyone," Noel said.

"Probably."

"The whole town is going to think we're—"

"Together?"

"Yeah."

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "Would that be so terrible?"

Noel stopped walking.

Eben stopped too. Looked at him.

"What?" Noel asked.

"If people thought we were together. Would that be terrible?"

"We're not together."

"I know."

"We're working together. Temporarily."

"I know," Eben repeated.

"So why—"

"I'm just asking a hypothetical question."

Noel stared at him. Snow was catching in Eben's dark hair. His expression was carefully neutral, but there was something in his eyes. Something that looked like hope.

"No," Noel said quietly. "It wouldn't be terrible."

Eben's expression shifted. Softened.

"Good," he said.

They walked back to Merryweather Hall in silence.

But it was a different kind of silence.

And when they returned to the tiny office, Noel was very aware that Eben had known his coffee order.

Had paid attention.

Had asked if it would be terrible if people thought they were together.

And Noel, sitting in the tiny office with his knees almost touching Eben's, realized he wanted people to think they were together.

Which was a problem.

Because they weren't.

They were temporary.

Eleven more days.

Then Eben would leave.

And Noel would go back to being alone.

Like always.

He looked at Eben, who was focused on his laptop, and tried to remember why that had ever been enough.

He couldn't.

And that was terrifying.
