# Chapter 2: The Room Problem

**NOEL**

Everhart Crafts was exactly what it sounded like: chaos in retail form.

The moment they stepped through the door, Noel was assaulted by glitter, hot glue fumes, and holiday music played at a volume that suggested the speakers were screaming for help.

"Isn't it wonderful?" Hugh swept through the aisles like he owned the place. Which, technically, he did.

"It's something," Noel said.

Eben said nothing. He looked like a man who'd just walked into his own personal nightmare and was trying to maintain composure through sheer force of will.

"Now!" Hugh spun to face them. "While I grab the ribbon, you two can make yourselves useful!"

"Hugh, we really need to get back—"

Hugh pressed something into Noel's hands. A craft kit. For making ornaments.

"It'll take five minutes," Hugh said. "Ten tops. And you'll have adorable matching ornaments!"

"We don't need matching ornaments," Eben said.

"Everyone needs matching ornaments." Hugh was already disappearing into the ribbon aisle. "I'll be right back!"

Noel looked at the craft kit. Looked at Eben.

Eben was staring at the kit like it had personally offended him.

"We don't have to—" Noel started.

"We're doing the craft," Eben said flatly.

"Really?"

"If we don't, he'll make us come back."

Fair point.

They found a workspace—a table covered in glitter and what might have been dried hot glue. Noel opened the kit.

Instructions for making felt turtle doves.

Of course.

"Turtle doves," Noel said.

"Appropriate," Eben replied.

"For what?"

"The episode title."

Noel blinked. "You know the episode titles?"

"I read the briefing materials."

"There are no briefing materials about episode titles."

Eben's expression didn't change. "Then I'm very intuitive."

Noel stared at him. Eben picked up a piece of felt and a needle with the careful precision of someone defusing a bomb.

They worked in silence. The music screamed around them. Glitter drifted through the air like festive snow.

Noel tried to thread a needle. Failed. Tried again.

"Here," Eben said, and took the needle from him.

Their fingers brushed.

Both of them went very still.

Eben threaded the needle. Handed it back. Didn't quite meet Noel's eyes.

"Thanks," Noel said quietly.

"You're welcome."

They returned to crafting.

Noel's turtle dove looked drunk. Eben's looked like it had been engineered by NASA.

"How are you good at this?" Noel demanded.

"I'm good at following instructions."

"It's felt. And thread. How is it perfect?"

"Practice."

"You practice making felt birds?"

"I practice precision."

Noel looked at his sad, lopsided dove. Looked at Eben's perfect one.

"I hate you," he said.

"No, you don't."

The certainty in Eben's voice made Noel's chest do something dangerous.

**EBEN**

This was a disaster.

Not the craft. The craft was fine. Simple. Logical.

The disaster was that Eben had just said "No, you don't" with complete confidence, and Noel was looking at him like he'd revealed something important.

Which he had.

Damn it.

"Done!" Hugh reappeared with an armful of ribbon. "Oh, you made the doves! They're perfect!"

"Mine's not perfect," Noel said.

"It's charming! Eben's is perfect. Yours is charming. Together they're adorable."

Eben wanted to argue. Wanted to point out that turtle doves had nothing to do with festival logistics.

But Noel was smiling. A real smile. Not the performer smile. The one that made his eyes crinkle.

"They are kind of cute," Noel admitted.

"You're keeping them," Hugh declared. "Consider them a gift. Now! Let's get you two to your new office!"

They paid for the ribbon—Hugh insisted—and left the store.

Covered in glitter.

Eben looked at his coat. There were sparkles on his sleeve. On his collar. Probably in his hair.

"It's everywhere," Noel said, brushing at his own jacket. "How is it everywhere?"

"Glitter is eternal," Eben said.

"That's ominous."

"That's accurate."

They walked back to Merryweather Hall. Hugh led them to the backup office.

It was tiny.

Eben had seen closets with more square footage.

One desk. Two chairs. A filing cabinet. A window that looked out on the parking lot.

And approximately three feet of space between the chairs.

"Cozy!" Hugh announced. "I'll leave you to it!"

He fled before either of them could protest.

Noel stood in the doorway. Stared at the room.

"This is..." Noel started.

"Inefficient," Eben finished.

"I was going to say 'intimate.'"

"That too."

They looked at each other.

Noel's hair still had glitter in it. Catching the light. Making him look like he'd been dusted with stars.

Eben looked away.

"We should set up," he said.

"Right. Yes. Set up."

They arranged themselves. Eben took the chair facing the window. Noel took the one facing the door.

Their knees almost touched.

Almost.

Eben was hyperaware of the distance. Of how small it was. Of how easy it would be to close it.

He opened his laptop. Focused on the screen.

Tried very hard not to notice that Noel smelled like coffee and something warm and that there was still glitter on his collar.

"This is fine," Noel said.

"It's fine," Eben agreed.

Neither of them sounded convinced.

They worked.

In the tiny office.

Very close.

For the whole day.

This was going to be a problem.
