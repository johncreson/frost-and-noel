# Chapter 8: Hook Ending

Noel sat in his car and stared at the steering wheel.

His hands were shaking.

His lips were tingling.

His entire world had just tilted sideways and he had no idea how to tilt it back.

He'd kissed Eben Frost.

No.

That wasn't accurate.

They'd kissed each other.

Mutual. Deliberate. Undeniable.

And now Noel was sitting in his car in the Merryweather Hall parking lot at 10:23 PM, watching Eben's taillights disappear down Main Street, and trying to figure out what the hell he was supposed to do with that information.

They'd agreed to talk tomorrow.

That was a lie.

They both knew it was a lie.

Because what was there to talk about?

They'd kissed. It had been—

God.

It had been perfect.

Eben's hand on his jaw. Gentle and certain. Like Noel was something precious.

Noel's hand fisted in Eben's collar. Desperate and wanting. Like he could keep Eben there if he just held on tight enough.

The kiss itself. Soft, then not soft. Questioning, then answering.

Everything.

It had been everything.

And it couldn't happen again.

Because Eben was temporary.

Ten more days.

Then he'd leave.

And Noel would go back to being alone.

Useful. Needed. Alone.

Except now he knew what it felt like to be wanted.

Not needed. Not useful.

Wanted.

For himself.

For no reason except that Eben had looked at him and decided he was worth wanting.

Noel put his head on the steering wheel.

"What did I just do?" he whispered to the empty car.

The car, unsurprisingly, didn't answer.

His phone buzzed.

**Wes:** *I saw Eben's car leaving. You're still in the parking lot. Are you okay?*

**Noel:** *Define okay.*

**Wes:** *That bad, huh?*

**Noel:** *That good. Which is worse.*

**Wes:** *Want to talk about it?*

**Noel:** *Not even a little bit.*

**Wes:** *Okay. But I'm here if you change your mind. And Noel?*

**Noel:** *Yeah?*

**Wes:** *Whatever happened, you deserve good things. Remember that.*

Noel stared at the message.

Deserved.

Did he deserve this?

Did he deserve Eben's careful attention and his perfect coffee-making and the way he'd said "Noel" like it meant something?

Did he deserve the kiss?

Did he deserve to want more?

Noel didn't know.

He just knew that he did want more.

Wanted it desperately.

Wanted it in a way that felt dangerous and inevitable and absolutely terrifying.

He started his car.

Drove home through the quiet streets of Tinsel Town.

Went inside.

Didn't sleep.

Just lay in bed and thought about Eben's hand on his jaw and the way the tiny office had felt like the entire world and the fact that tomorrow they'd have to face each other and pretend nothing had changed.

When everything had changed.

Everything.

Noel rolled over. Stared at his ceiling.

Counted reasons why this was a bad idea.

Got to three hundred and forty-seven before he gave up.

Because the truth was, he didn't care if it was a bad idea.

He just cared that it had happened.

And that he wanted it to happen again.

And that in ten days, Eben would leave, and Noel would have to figure out how to go back to being alone.

After knowing what it felt like to be wanted.

"Temporary," Noel whispered to the darkness.

The word tasted like a lie.

Like it had from the beginning.

Like it always would.

He closed his eyes.

And thought about nothing but that kiss for the rest of the night.
