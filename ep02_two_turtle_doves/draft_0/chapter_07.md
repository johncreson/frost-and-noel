# Chapter 7: The Kiss

**EBEN**

Their hands were touching.

Just barely. Just fingers brushing over papers that neither of them were actually reaching for.

Eben should pull away.

He didn't.

Noel didn't either.

The silence stretched. Loaded. Dangerous.

Eben looked up.

Noel was already looking at him.

Their eyes met.

Held.

"Noel," Eben said again.

It came out quieter this time. Rougher.

Like a question.

Like a confession.

Noel's breath caught. His pupils dilated.

"Yeah?" Noel whispered.

Eben didn't know what he was asking.

Didn't know what he was offering.

Just knew that they were very close, and the tiny office was very quiet, and Noel was looking at him like—

Like he wanted—

Like he—

---

**NOEL**

Noel didn't think.

If he'd thought, he would have stopped himself.

Would have remembered that this was temporary. That Eben was leaving. That wanting this was dangerous.

But he didn't think.

He just leaned in.

Slowly.

Giving Eben time to pull away.

Giving himself time to change his mind.

Neither of them moved.

And then Noel's lips touched Eben's, and thinking became impossible.

---

**DUAL**

The kiss was soft.

Questioning.

Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's jaw. Gentle. Deliberate.

Noel made a sound—small, surprised—and leaned closer.

The kiss deepened.

Became less soft.

Much less soft.

Noel's hand fisted in Eben's collar, pulling him closer. Eben's other hand found Noel's waist, steadying them both.

The papers scattered off the desk.

Neither of them noticed.

Noel tasted like coffee and something sweet. Eben kissed him like he was trying to memorize it. Like he knew this was temporary and he was determined to remember every second.

When they finally pulled apart, they were both breathing hard.

Noel's eyes were wide. Stunned.

Eben's hand was still on his jaw.

Neither of them moved.

"Well," Eben said, after approximately seventeen years. "That happened."

Noel laughed. Breathless. Shaky.

"Yeah," he said. "It did."

They stared at each other.

The tiny office felt even smaller now.

Or maybe they felt larger.

Maybe the world had shifted and they were the only solid things left.

"We should—" Eben started.

"Yeah," Noel agreed.

Neither of them finished the sentence.

Neither of them moved.

Eben's thumb brushed Noel's cheekbone. Soft. Unconscious.

Noel's breath hitched.

"Eben—"

"I know."

"We can't—"

"I know."

"This is—"

"I know."

Noel closed his eyes. "Then why does it feel—"

"I don't know."

When Noel opened his eyes again, Eben was looking at him like he was something precious. Something breakable.

Something worth keeping.

"We should talk about this," Noel said.

"We should."

"Tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow."

It was a lie.

They both knew it was a lie.

But they nodded anyway, and separated, and tried to pretend that everything hadn't just changed.

The glitter on Eben's collar caught the light.

Noel looked away.

They packed up in silence.

Loaded silence.

The kind of silence that was full of everything they weren't saying.

"See you tomorrow," Noel said at the door.

"Six AM," Eben replied.

Their eyes met.

Neither mentioned the kiss.

Neither mentioned the way Eben's hand had felt on Noel's jaw.

Neither mentioned the fact that they both wanted to do it again.

They just said goodnight.

And left.

And tried to pretend their hands weren't shaking.
