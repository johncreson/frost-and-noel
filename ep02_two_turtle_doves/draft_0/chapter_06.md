# Chapter 6: Vulnerability Slip

The quiet had settled like snow.

Eben sat in the tiny office and tried to remember the last time he'd felt this—

What was the word?

Exposed.

That was it.

He felt exposed.

Not physically. Physically, he was fine. Controlled. His shirt was still pressed, his expression still neutral, his hands still steady.

But internally?

Internally, he was unraveling.

He'd admitted he didn't know why he was still here.

He'd told Noel that control was a choice because he didn't trust feelings.

He'd said things that were true, and truth was dangerous, and Eben had spent years avoiding danger.

And yet.

Here he was.

In a tiny office.

With Noel Merrick.

At 9:47 PM.

Still not leaving.

"Eben," Noel said quietly.

Eben looked up.

Noel was watching him with an expression that was too soft. Too knowing.

"Yeah?" Eben said.

"Why did you take this job?"

The question landed like a stone.

Eben should lie. Should say "the mayor asked" or "the pay was good" or any of the dozen deflections he'd perfected over the years.

Instead, he said, "I don't know."

Noel went still. "That's not an answer."

"It's the truth."

"You always have answers."

"Not for this."

"Why not?"

Eben looked at his hands. At the glitter still dusted on his cuffs. At the evidence of a day spent in close quarters with someone who made him want things he'd promised himself he wouldn't want.

"Because," Eben said slowly, "I don't usually take jobs like this."

"Like what?"

"Small towns. Festivals. Twelve days in one place."

"What do you usually take?"

"Corporate contracts. Three days, maybe a week. Get in, fix the problem, get out."

"Before it becomes something you can't leave," Noel said quietly.

Eben's chest tightened. "Yes."

"So why did you take this one?"

"I don't know."

"Eben—"

"I don't," Eben insisted. "The mayor called. I should have said no. I had other offers. Better offers. But I—"

He stopped.

"You what?" Noel prompted.

"I said yes."

"Why?"

Because I was lonely, Eben thought. Because I've been doing this for five years and I'm tired. Because something about this town, this festival, this ridiculous twelve-day commitment felt like—

Like what?

Like home?

No.

Eben didn't do home.

Home was where you stayed. Where you built things. Where you let people matter.

Home was dangerous.

"I don't know," he said again.

Noel was quiet for a long moment. Then: "You could have said no."

"I could have."

"But you didn't."

"...I didn't."

"Why not?"

Eben looked at him. Really looked.

Noel's hair was a mess. His shirt was wrinkled. There was glitter on his collar and shadows under his eyes and he looked exhausted and beautiful and real.

And Eben realized, sitting in the tiny office with the truth sitting heavy in his chest, that he knew exactly why he'd taken this job.

He just couldn't say it.

Not yet.

Maybe not ever.

"I don't know," he said for the third time.

But this time, it tasted like a lie.

Noel's expression said he knew it.

"Okay," Noel said softly.

"Okay?"

"You don't have to tell me. I just—" Noel looked down at his hands. "I wanted to know if it was just me."

"Just you what?"

"Feeling like this matters."

Eben's breath caught.

"It's not just you," he said.

Noel looked up. Their eyes met.

The room felt smaller.

The air felt thicker.

Something was shifting. Something fundamental. Something that couldn't be unshifted.

Eben should stop this. Should stand up. Should leave.

He didn't move.

"Noel," he said.

It was the first time he'd used Noel's first name since yesterday.

It felt like admitting something terrible.

It felt like admitting everything.

Noel's breath caught. "Yeah?"

Eben didn't know what he was going to say.

Didn't know what he could say.

Didn't know—

One of them reached for papers on the desk.

Their hands brushed.

And neither of them pulled away.
