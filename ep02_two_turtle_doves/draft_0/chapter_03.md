# Chapter 3: Competence Tension

The room was approximately the size of a confession booth.

Which felt appropriate, given what Eben was confessing to himself.

He was watching Noel Merrick.

Again.

Still.

It had been two hours since they'd settled into the tiny office, and Eben had accomplished approximately forty percent of his planned tasks because the other sixty percent of his brain was occupied with noticing things he absolutely should not be noticing.

The way Noel bit his lip when he was concentrating.

The way he hummed under his breath—something tuneless and unconscious.

The way the glitter in his hair caught the light every time he moved.

The tired lines around his eyes that suggested he'd slept as poorly as Eben had.

Stop, Eben told himself. This is not your concern.

Noel's sleep schedule was not his business. Noel's habits were not his business. Noel's—

Noel looked up.

Their eyes met.

Eben didn't look away fast enough.

"What?" Noel asked.

"Nothing."

"You were staring."

"I was thinking."

"While staring at me."

"I was looking in your direction while thinking."

"That's called staring."

Eben returned his attention to his laptop. "My apologies."

Silence.

Eben could feel Noel still looking at him.

"Are you okay?" Noel asked quietly.

The question surprised him. "Why wouldn't I be?"

"You seem... tense."

"I'm always tense."

"More tense than usual."

Eben looked up. Noel was watching him with an expression that was too perceptive. Too knowing.

"I'm fine," Eben said.

"That's what I say when I'm not fine."

"Then we have that in common."

Noel's smile was small. Sad. "Yeah. I guess we do."

Something shifted in the air between them.

Eben should look away. Should return to work. Should maintain the professional distance that was rapidly eroding in this tiny, glitter-dusted office.

Instead, he heard himself say, "You're good at this."

Noel blinked. "What?"

"The festival. You're good at it."

"I'm barely holding it together."

"You're holding it together better than most people could."

"That's not—"

"You care," Eben continued. "About the details. About the people. You make them feel seen."

Noel went very still. "Eben—"

"It's a skill. Not everyone has it."

"You have it."

"I have efficiency. That's different."

"Is it?"

Eben considered. "Yes. I make things work. You make people happy. That's harder."

Noel was staring at him now. Really staring.

"That might be the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me," Noel said quietly.

Eben's chest tightened. "That's concerning."

"Why?"

"Because it should be obvious. People should tell you that constantly."

"They don't."

"Then they're not paying attention."

The words hung between them.

Noel's expression did something complicated. Soft and surprised and dangerous.

"You pay attention," Noel said.

It wasn't a question.

Eben should deny it. Should deflect. Should maintain some semblance of professional distance.

"Yes," he said instead. "I do."

The room felt smaller.

Or maybe Eben felt larger. Specifically, his chest felt too large for his ribcage, which was concerning from a cardiovascular standpoint and absolutely devastating from an emotional one.

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it. Looked down at his laptop.

"We should get back to work," Noel said.

"Yes."

Neither of them moved.

The glitter on Noel's collar caught the light.

Eben looked away.

They worked.

In silence.

In the tiny office.

Very aware of each other.

And Eben knew, with absolute certainty, that he was in serious trouble.
