## BLURB

The kiss should have been a mistake.

Noel Merrick has spent two days pretending Eben Frost is just a work partner. Professional. Temporary. Definitely not the reason his heart races every time that charcoal coat enters the room.

Then Eben says his name like it means something.

And Noel stops pretending.

Eben doesn't do this. Doesn't stay. Doesn't let anyone past the walls he's spent years building. But Noel Merrick keeps finding cracks—with his exhausted smile, his stubborn competence, and his complete inability to ask for anything he actually needs.

One kiss. That's all it was supposed to be.

Except now Eben can't stop thinking about doing it again. And again. And the twelve days he promised himself would stay simple are suddenly looking a lot more complicated.

**Day two of twelve. The rules are already breaking.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring grumpy-sunshine dynamics, forced proximity, first kiss tension, explicit heat, and a guaranteed HEA.*
