## BLURB

He's not supposed to want forever.

Eben Frost has spent his entire adult life avoiding promises. Temporary contracts. Clean exits. No attachments that can't be severed when the job ends.

Then Noel Merrick looks at him across a crowded festival square—tired, glitter-covered, completely radiant—and asks a question that changes everything.

*"What happens after the twelve days?"*

Eben doesn't have an answer. He's supposed to leave. That was always the plan. Chicago is waiting. The next contract. The next temporary thing.

But Noel isn't temporary anymore.

And the ring in the antique shop window—the one Eben keeps walking past, keeps not buying, keeps not thinking about—is starting to look less like a purchase and more like a promise.

**Day five of twelve. Some questions don't have easy answers.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring commitment discussions, future planning, grumpy-sunshine dynamics, explicit heat, and a guaranteed HEA.*
