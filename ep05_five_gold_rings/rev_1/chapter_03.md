## Chapter 3: The Performance

The town tour was going well, which meant it was going terribly.

Miranda Chen was delighted by everything. The decorations. The shops. The way Tinsel Town looked like it had been designed by someone who took "festive" as a personal challenge.

She was also delighted by Noel and Eben, which was the terrible part.

"You two are so natural together," she said, snapping another photo as they walked through Evergreen Square.

Natural. Right. Noel felt about as natural as a animatronic elf.

Eben's hand was in his. That was the problem. That was the entire problem.

They were holding hands for the performance. For the optics. For the sponsor who thought they were a couple building traditions together.

Except Eben's hand was warm. And their fingers fit together in a way that felt deliberate. And Noel couldn't stop noticing the way Eben's thumb brushed across his knuckles every few steps, like he wasn't even aware he was doing it.

"Tell me about how you two met," Miranda said, phone still out.

Noel and Eben exchanged a glance.

"Work," Eben said.

"The festival," Noel added.

"Love at first spreadsheet?" Miranda laughed. "That's adorable."

It wasn't love. It was complicated. It was messy. It was—

Eben's hand tightened slightly on his.

Noel's brain went offline.

"Something like that," Noel heard himself say.

They walked through the square. Past the bakery, where Wes waved at them through the window with a knowing look that Noel chose to ignore. Past the craft shop, where someone had hung a banner that said "SUPPORT LOCAL LOVE."

Noel was going to die. He was going to die of irony poisoning right here in Evergreen Square.

Hugh appeared at the edge of the square, coffee in hand, watching them with the expression of someone observing a nature documentary about mating rituals.

"This is *fascinating*," Hugh called out.

"Go away, Hugh," Noel said through his smile.

"Absolutely not. This is better than television."

Miranda laughed. "Friend of yours?"

"Unfortunately," Noel muttered.

Hugh saluted them with his coffee and wandered toward the bakery, still grinning.

*Was this real, or was he just being useful again?*

The thought surfaced unbidden. Eben needed a fake boyfriend. Noel was convenient. Willing. Already entangled.

It wasn't fair to think that. Eben had said—

But Eben hadn't said anything. Not really. Just "I need to think" and a door closing behind him.

Noel smiled for the camera and tried not to spiral.

"Can I get a photo of you two by the tree?" Miranda gestured to the massive Christmas tree in the center of the square.

"Of course," Eben said.

They positioned themselves in front of the tree. Noel tried to figure out what "natural" looked like when you were fake dating someone you'd already slept with and were currently navigating a boundary that was killing you both.

"Closer," Miranda said. "You're a couple! You can touch!"

Eben's arm went around Noel's waist.

Noel stopped breathing.

"Perfect! Now look at each other."

They turned. Their faces were maybe six inches apart. Noel could see the exact moment Eben's expression shifted from professional to something else. Something that looked almost—

The camera clicked.

"Beautiful!" Miranda checked her phone. "Oh, that's lovely. You're looking at each other instead of the camera, but it's so genuine."

Genuine. That was one word for it.

Noel looked at the photo Miranda showed them. In it, they were looking at each other with expressions that were definitely not appropriate for a professional working relationship.

"Great," Noel said weakly.

Eben's arm was still around his waist.

Miranda took a few more photos, chattering about engagement and brand alignment and family values. Noel smiled and nodded and tried very hard not to notice that Eben hadn't let go yet.

"I have a meeting with the Mayor," Miranda said finally. "But I'll see you both at the reception tonight, yes?"

"We'll be there," Eben said.

Miranda walked away, already typing on her phone.

Eben's arm dropped.

Noel immediately missed it, which was a problem.

"That went well," Noel said.

"She bought it."

"Yeah."

They stood there, in front of the Christmas tree, not looking at each other.

"We should—" Eben started.

"Yeah," Noel said.

Neither of them moved.

"This would be easier," Eben said quietly, "if touching you didn't feel like coming home."

Noel's breath caught. "Eben—"

"That was a concerning metaphor." Eben's jaw tightened. "Forget I said that."

"I'm not going to forget that."

"Try."

Eben walked away.

Noel stood in front of the Christmas tree, hand still warm from where Eben had held it, and thought: *We're in so much trouble.*
