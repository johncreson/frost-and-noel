## Chapter 1: The Night Before

Noel stood in the courtyard for a long time after Eben walked away.

*I need to think.*

That's what Eben had said. Not "it meant something." Not "we'll figure this out." Just—*I need to think.*

The fairy lights swayed in the cold breeze. The sounds of cleanup drifted from the square—volunteers calling to each other, metal risers clanging as they were loaded into trucks. Normal sounds. Festival sounds.

Nothing about this felt normal.

Noel replayed the moment. The way Eben's jaw had tightened. The conflict in his eyes. The way he'd turned and walked away without looking back.

It wasn't rejection. Noel knew rejection. This was something else—something that looked like fear wearing a professional mask.

But knowing that didn't make it hurt less.

Eventually, the cold won. Noel pulled Eben's scarf tighter around his neck and started the walk home.

---

His apartment was dark when he got there. Cold. He flipped on the lights and stood in the doorway, keys in hand, staring at the space like it belonged to someone else.

The bed was made. He'd done that this morning, in a fit of optimistic denial. The coffee pot was clean. The kitchen was spotless.

Everything was exactly as he'd left it.

Except him. He was different.

He closed the door. Locked it. Set his keys on the counter with the kind of careful precision that meant he was holding himself together by sheer force of will.

The scarf was still around his neck.

Noel unwrapped it slowly. Held it in his hands. The fabric was soft. Well-made. The kind of thing Eben would choose because it was practical and well-designed and would last.

The kind of thing Noel had stolen without asking.

He should feel guilty about that.

He didn't.

His phone buzzed. Hugh. *You alive?*

*Yeah. Home. Fine.*

*Liar. Want company?*

*No. Thanks though.*

*Okay. Call if you need me. Also you're keeping the scarf, right? Because that's a whole symbolic thing and I'm invested now.*

Noel looked at the scarf in his hands.

*Yeah,* he typed. *I'm keeping it.*

*Good. That's character growth. Proud of you.*

Noel set the phone down and walked to the couch. Sat. Stared at the ceiling.

*I need to think.*

Eben's words echoed in the silence.

What was there to think about? Either last night meant something or it didn't. Either Eben wanted this or he didn't. It shouldn't be that complicated.

Except nothing with Eben was simple. The man ran so hot and cold that Noel was getting emotional whiplash—one moment tender and devastating, the next distant and professional. The way he'd touched Noel last night versus the way he'd looked right through him this morning. Like two different people.

Or maybe just one person who was terrified of something.

Noel closed his eyes.

He wasn't going to push. That wasn't how Noel Merrick operated. He gave people space. He let them come to him. He made himself useful and hoped it was enough.

But he also wasn't going to pretend last night didn't happen.

That wasn't an option anymore.

His phone buzzed again. This time it was the festival group chat—something about tomorrow's schedule. Right. The sponsor was arriving in the morning. Some corporate rep who wanted to see the "authentic small-town charm" before committing to next year's funding.

Which meant Noel would have to smile and be professional and stand next to Eben for photos and pretend everything was fine.

He could do that. He was good at that.

He wrapped the scarf around his neck again and let his head fall back against the couch.

*I need to think.*

It wasn't an answer. It wasn't rejection either.

But it was something.

For now.

Noel woke up on the couch, still wearing the scarf.

Sunlight was streaming through the windows. His neck hurt. His back hurt. Everything hurt, actually, which was what he got for sleeping in jeans like an idiot.

He checked his phone. 7:14 AM. December 18. Day five of the festival.

The sponsor arrived at nine.

Noel groaned, rolled off the couch, and headed for the shower.

He took his time getting ready. Not because he was nervous—he wasn't nervous, he was a professional—but because he wanted to look put-together. The blue button-down. The good slacks. Hair actually styled instead of just pushed back.

He looked in the mirror. He looked fine.

He felt like he was walking into battle.

Eben would be there. Of course Eben would be there. They were running this festival together. They'd have to stand side by side and smile for photos and act like everything was normal.

*I need to think.*

Had Eben thought? Had he made a decision?

Noel grabbed his coat—and after a moment's hesitation, Eben's scarf—and headed out the door.

Whatever Eben had decided, Noel would deal with it.

He'd survived worse.

Probably.
