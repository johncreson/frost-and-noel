## Chapter 4: Jealousy Spark

The Garland Cup was busy for a Wednesday afternoon, which Eben supposed made sense given that it was December in Tinsel Town and people needed somewhere warm to recover from aggressive cheerfulness.

He was here for a meeting with Miranda and several local business owners. Noel was here because they were apparently joined at the hip now. For the performance.

The performance was going to kill him.

Eben had spent the last hour watching Noel charm every single person in the room. It was impressive, really. The way Noel could make anyone feel like they were the most interesting person he'd ever met. The way he listened. The way he smiled.

Eben was not jealous. He was simply... observing. Intensely. With his jaw clenched.

"Noel!" A man Eben vaguely recognized from the business association approached. "Great to see you. I wanted to talk about the vendor coordination for Saturday."

"Of course," Noel said, all warmth and professional competence.

The man—Marcus? Martin?—leaned in. Too close. His hand landed on Noel's arm.

Eben's vision went slightly red.

He was not jealous. The man was simply standing too close, speaking too loudly, and existing too aggressively. This wasn't jealousy. This was spatial awareness.

The man laughed at something Noel said. His hand was still on Noel's arm.

Eben stood up.

He crossed the room in four strides. His hand found the small of Noel's back—possessive, obvious, absolutely not subtle.

"Sorry to interrupt," Eben said. His voice was perfectly polite. His hand was not polite at all. "Noel, we need to review the schedule."

Noel's eyes widened slightly. "Oh. Right. Of course."

The man—definitely Marcus—looked between them. "I didn't realize you two were—"

"Together," Eben said. "We are. Together."

"For the festival," Noel added quickly.

"Right. The festival." Marcus stepped back. "I'll catch you later, Noel."

He walked away.

Eben's hand stayed on Noel's back.

"That was interesting," Noel said quietly.

"Standard couple behavior," Eben said.

"Mmm." Noel turned to look at him. "Your hand is still on my back."

"Positioning."

"It wasn't there before he started talking to me."

"Coincidence."

"Eben."

Eben removed his hand. Stepped back. Tried to remember how to be a person who didn't just stake a claim on someone in the middle of a coffee shop.

"We should go," he said.

"We should talk," Noel countered.

"There's nothing to talk about."

"You just got jealous."

"I did not get jealous."

"Your entire face went cold when he touched my arm."

"That's just my face."

"Eben."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. Noel's expression was careful. Hopeful. Guarded.

"Outside," Eben said quietly. "Not here."

Noel nodded.

They left the café. Walked around to the back, where a small alley opened onto a delivery area. Private. Quiet.

"You're jealous," Noel said.

"I'm not jealous."

"Your hand was on my back for ten minutes."

"That's positioning."

"It wasn't there before he started talking to me."

"...Coincidence."

Noel laughed. It wasn't a happy sound. "You're lying."

"I'm maintaining the performance."

"The performance." Noel stepped closer. "Eben. We have rules. Between us, remember? Temporary. Unless you don't want it to be."

The silence stretched.

Eben didn't answer. Couldn't answer. Because the truth was that he didn't want it to be temporary. He didn't want it to be fake. He didn't want to pretend that touching Noel was just for show.

But he also didn't know how to say that without breaking everything.

"Eben," Noel said softly. "I need to know what this is."

"I don't know."

"Then figure it out."

Noel walked away.

Eben stood in the alley, alone, and thought: *I'm in so much trouble.*
