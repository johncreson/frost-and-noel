## Chapter 6: Walking Home

Snow was falling on Tinsel Town.

Noel and Eben walked through it in silence, hands in pockets, breath misting in the cold air.

The reception was over. The sponsor was happy. The photos were taken. The performance was done.

Except it wasn't a performance anymore. They both knew it.

"We made it convincing," Noel said finally.

"Did we?" Eben's voice was quiet.

Noel looked at him. "What do you mean?"

"I mean—" Eben stopped walking. Turned to face him. "I wasn't acting. In those photos. When I touched you. When I—" He stopped. "I wasn't acting."

Noel's heart was pounding. "I know."

"You know."

"I wasn't acting either."

The snow fell around them. The street was empty. No one was watching.

Eben reached out. Took Noel's hand.

"What are you doing?" Noel asked softly.

"I don't know."

"The sponsor isn't watching."

"I know."

"No one's watching."

"I know." Eben's hand tightened on his. "I just don't want to let go."

Noel's breath caught.

They stood there in the falling snow, holding hands, and Noel thought: *This is real. This is finally real.*

"Eben—"

"I'm still leaving," Eben said. "In a week. That hasn't changed."

"I know."

"And I still don't know how to do this."

"I know that too."

"But I—" Eben's jaw tightened. "I can't keep pretending this is temporary."

"Then don't."

"It has to be. I have a job. A life. I can't—"

"One week," Noel said. "We have one week. Can we just—can we have that? Without the rules? Without the boundaries? Just—us?"

Eben looked at him. Snow was catching in his hair. His expression was torn.

"One week," he said finally.

"One week."

"And then—"

"We'll figure it out."

Eben laughed. It sounded broken. "We're terrible at figuring things out."

"Then we'll be terrible together."

Eben pulled him closer. Kissed him.

It was soft. Gentle. Nothing like their first kiss. This was—tender. Real.

When they pulled apart, Noel was breathless.

"One week," Eben said again.

"One week," Noel agreed.

They walked home through the snow, hands clasped, and Noel thought: *I'm in so much trouble.*

But for the first time, it felt like the good kind of trouble.
