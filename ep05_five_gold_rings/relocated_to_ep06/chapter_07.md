## Chapter 7: The Morning Collision

Noel woke up in his own bed, which was already an improvement over the couch.

He also woke up to a text from Eben, which was definitely an improvement over last time.

*Coffee? -E*

Noel stared at the message for a solid thirty seconds before responding.

*Yes. Where?*

*Your place. I'm outside.*

Noel scrambled out of bed, looked in the mirror, decided his hair was a lost cause, and went to answer the door.

Eben was standing there with two cups of coffee and an expression that suggested he hadn't slept much either.

"Hi," Noel said.

"Hi." Eben handed him a coffee. "Can I come in?"

"Yeah. Of course."

They sat on Noel's couch. Drank coffee. This time, Eben's thigh pressed against his. Neither moved away.

"So," Noel said finally. "One week."

"Starting now," Eben agreed.

"What does that mean? Exactly?"

Eben set his coffee down. Turned to face him. "It means I stop running. It means we stop pretending. It means—" He paused. "It means I want to try. For real."

Noel's chest felt tight. "Okay."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." He smiled. "I can work with that."

They spent the morning on the couch. Drinking coffee. Not talking. Just—being. Eben's hand found its way to Noel's, and neither of them let go.

It felt normal. Easy. Like they'd been doing this for years instead of hours.

Noel's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, expecting Hugh's usual chaos—

And froze.

It was a notification from Miranda Chen's social media. "The heart of the festival ❤️"

The photo was them. From the tree. Looking at each other like—

Like they were in love.

"What?" Eben asked.

Noel turned the phone toward him.

Eben's expression went very still.

The photo had already been shared forty-three times. Comments were flooding in. *Adorable! So cute together! Relationship goals!*

"Well," Eben said quietly. "That's public."

"That's very public."

"Is that—" Eben's jaw tightened. "Does that bother you?"

Noel looked at the photo again. At the way Eben was looking at him in it. At the way he was looking back.

"No," Noel said slowly. "It doesn't bother me."

Eben's hand tightened on his.

"The sponsor isn't watching anymore," Noel said. "This isn't for the performance."

"No. It isn't."

"So this is—"

"Real," Eben finished. "If you want it to be."

Noel leaned in and kissed him. Soft. Certain.

"I want it to be," he said.

The final sponsor event was mercifully short.

Miranda gave a speech about community values and authentic partnerships. She showed some of the photos—including the viral one—and Noel tried not to die of self-consciousness.

"Thank you both for being such wonderful ambassadors for Tinsel Town," Miranda said afterward, shaking their hands. "You're exactly the kind of couple our brand wants to support."

Couple. The word didn't sting anymore.

"Thank you," Noel said.

"We're happy to help," Eben added.

Miranda left with promises of future sponsorships. The Mayor looked relieved enough to cry.

Hugh appeared at Noel's elbow the moment she was out of earshot. "So. That photo went viral."

"I noticed."

"And you two are actually together now, right? Because the pining was exhausting."

"We're—" Noel glanced at Eben.

"Together," Eben said firmly.

Hugh's grin was insufferable. "Finally. I've been waiting for this since day one."

"Go away, Hugh."

"Going. But for the record? You're good together."

He walked away, leaving them alone in the emptying hall.

Eben took Noel's hand. "Ready to go?"

Noel looked at their interlaced fingers. At the ease of it. At how natural it felt.

"Yeah," he said. "Let's go home."

They left together, hand in hand, and for the first time, Noel didn't question whether it was real.

It was real.

They just had to figure out what came next.
