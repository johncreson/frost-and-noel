## Chapter 1: The Night Before

Noel stood in the courtyard for a long time after Eben walked away.

*I need to think.*

That's what Eben had said. Not "it meant something." Not "we'll figure this out." Just—*I need to think.*

The fairy lights swayed in the cold breeze. The sounds of cleanup drifted from the square—volunteers calling to each other, metal risers clanging as they were loaded into trucks. Normal sounds. Festival sounds.

Nothing about this felt normal.

Noel replayed the moment. The way Eben's jaw had tightened. The conflict in his eyes. The way he'd turned and walked away without looking back.

It wasn't rejection. Noel knew rejection. This was something else—something that looked like fear wearing a professional mask.

But knowing that didn't make it hurt less.

Eventually, the cold won. Noel pulled Eben's scarf tighter around his neck and started the walk home.

---

His apartment was dark when he got there. Cold. He flipped on the lights and stood in the doorway, keys in hand, staring at the space like it belonged to someone else.

The bed was made. He'd done that this morning, in a fit of optimistic denial. The coffee pot was clean. The kitchen was spotless.

Everything was exactly as he'd left it.

Except him. He was different.

He closed the door. Locked it. Set his keys on the counter with the kind of careful precision that meant he was holding himself together by sheer force of will.

The scarf was still around his neck.

Noel unwrapped it slowly. Held it in his hands. The fabric was soft. Well-made. The kind of thing Eben would choose because it was practical and well-designed and would last.

The kind of thing Noel had stolen without asking.

He should feel guilty about that.

He didn't.

His phone buzzed. Hugh. *You alive?*

*Yeah. Home. Fine.*

*Liar. Want company?*

*No. Thanks though.*

*Okay. Call if you need me. Also you're keeping the scarf, right? Because that's a whole symbolic thing and I'm invested now.*

Noel looked at the scarf in his hands.

*Yeah,* he typed. *I'm keeping it.*

*Good. That's character growth. Proud of you.*

Noel set the phone down and walked to the couch. Sat. Stared at the ceiling.

*I need to think.*

Eben's words echoed in the silence.

What was there to think about? Either last night meant something or it didn't. Either Eben wanted this or he didn't. It shouldn't be that complicated.

Except nothing with Eben was simple. The man ran so hot and cold that Noel was getting emotional whiplash—one moment tender and devastating, the next distant and professional. The way he'd touched Noel last night versus the way he'd looked right through him this morning. Like two different people.

Or maybe just one person who was terrified of something.

Noel closed his eyes.

He wasn't going to push. That wasn't how Noel Merrick operated. He gave people space. He let them come to him. He made himself useful and hoped it was enough.

But he also wasn't going to pretend last night didn't happen.

That wasn't an option anymore.

His phone buzzed again. This time it was the festival group chat—something about tomorrow's schedule. Right. The sponsor was arriving in the morning. Some corporate rep who wanted to see the "authentic small-town charm" before committing to next year's funding.

Which meant Noel would have to smile and be professional and stand next to Eben for photos and pretend everything was fine.

He could do that. He was good at that.

He wrapped the scarf around his neck again and let his head fall back against the couch.

*I need to think.*

It wasn't an answer. It wasn't rejection either.

But it was something.

For now.

---

Noel woke up on the couch, still wearing the scarf.

Sunlight was streaming through the windows. His neck hurt. His back hurt. Everything hurt, actually, which was what he got for sleeping in jeans like an idiot.

He checked his phone. 7:14 AM. December 18. Day five of the festival.

The sponsor arrived at nine.

Noel groaned, rolled off the couch, and headed for the shower.

He took his time getting ready. Not because he was nervous—he wasn't nervous, he was a professional—but because he wanted to look put-together. The blue button-down. The good slacks. Hair actually styled instead of just pushed back.

He looked in the mirror. He looked fine.

He felt like he was walking into battle.

Eben would be there. Of course Eben would be there. They were running this festival together. They'd have to stand side by side and smile for photos and act like everything was normal.

*I need to think.*

Had Eben thought? Had he made a decision?

Noel grabbed his coat—and after a moment's hesitation, Eben's scarf—and headed out the door.

Whatever Eben had decided, Noel would deal with it.

He'd survived worse.

Probably.

## Chapter 2: Sponsor Arrives

The sponsor assumed they were a couple. To be fair, they were standing too close together, had matching exhaustion, and were covered in traces of mutual glitter. An understandable mistake.

Noel realized the mistake approximately three seconds after it happened, which was two seconds too late to correct it without making everything worse.

"Oh, you're the couple!" The sponsor representative—Miranda Chen, according to her business card and the way she'd introduced herself four times—beamed at them. "How charming! Mayor Kringle mentioned you two were the heart of the festival."

Noel froze.

Eben froze.

Mayor Kringle, standing behind Miranda, went very pale and made a series of facial expressions that Noel interpreted as *please don't ruin this, I'm begging you.*

"We're—" Noel started.

"Very committed!" The Mayor stepped forward, voice too loud. "To the festival! They're very committed. To the work. Together. As a team."

Miranda's smile didn't waver. "That's wonderful. Family values are very important to our brand. It's so nice to see young people building something together."

Noel wanted to explain that they weren't building anything. They were imploding. Slowly. With excellent logistics.

Instead, he smiled. "Thank you. We're happy to help."

Beside him, Eben made a sound that might have been agreement or might have been internal screaming. Hard to tell.

Miranda pulled out her phone. "I'd love to get some photos for our social media. The two of you coordinating the festival—it's perfect for our messaging."

"Of course," Eben said. His voice was perfectly professional. His hand, however, had found the small of Noel's back, which was not professional at all.

Noel's brain short-circuited.

Miranda took several photos. Noel smiled. Eben smiled. They both looked like they were being held hostage by holiday cheer, which wasn't far from the truth.

"Perfect!" Miranda tucked her phone away. "I'll be here through the weekend observing the events. I'm so excited to see what you two have planned."

She walked away, already typing on her phone.

The Mayor waited exactly five seconds before grabbing both of them by the arms and dragging them into a side office.

---

"I'm sorry," Mayor Kringle said immediately. "I panicked."

"You panicked," Noel repeated.

"She assumed! And I didn't correct her! And now she thinks you're together, and I—" The Mayor ran a hand through his hair. "This is bad."

"Why is it bad?" Eben's voice was very calm. Too calm. The kind of calm that preceded either violence or a spreadsheet.

"Because our sponsor is very invested in 'family-friendly optics.' They want wholesome. They want community. They want—" The Mayor gestured helplessly. "Young couples building traditions together."

"We're not a couple," Noel said.

"I know that. You know that. But Miranda Chen doesn't know that, and if we tell her now, after I just—" The Mayor looked genuinely distressed. "The sponsorship is significant. It funds half the festival."

Eben and Noel exchanged a look.

It was a complicated look. It contained multitudes. It said *this is a disaster* and *we already slept together* and *we're currently navigating a boundary that's killing us both* and *how is this our life.*

"What are you suggesting?" Eben asked carefully.

The Mayor took a breath. "Three days. She's here through Sunday. If you could just—for the festival—"

"Fake date," Noel said flatly.

"I wouldn't put it that way."

"How would you put it?"

"Strategic partnership presentation?"

"That's fake dating."

The Mayor looked between them. "I know this is asking a lot. But the festival—"

"We'll do it," Eben said.

Noel's head snapped toward him. "We will?"

"For the festival." Eben's expression was unreadable. "Three days. Public appearances only. Strictly professional otherwise."

The Mayor's face lit up. "Really? You'll do it?"

"We'll do it," Noel heard himself say.

Because apparently his mouth had decided to agree with Eben without consulting his brain, which was currently screaming.

The Mayor thanked them profusely and left, probably to go have a stress-induced breakdown in private.

Noel and Eben stood in the office, alone, staring at each other.

"Fake dating," Noel said.

"For the festival," Eben said.

"This is a terrible idea."

"Objectively, yes."

"We're going to do it anyway."

"Apparently."

Noel laughed. It sounded slightly unhinged. "Okay. Okay. Rules. We need rules."

"Agreed."

They looked at each other. Neither moved.

"Public only," Eben said finally. "We act like a couple when the sponsor is around. Otherwise, nothing changes."

"Nothing changes," Noel repeated.

"This is temporary. Just for the visit."

"Temporary. Right." The word tasted like ash. "Anything else?"

Eben's jaw tightened. "This doesn't mean anything."

Noel's chest ached. "Got it."

They were standing too close. Noel could smell Eben's cologne. Could see the tension in his shoulders. Could feel the space between them like a physical thing.

"We should go," Eben said quietly. "She'll be expecting a tour."

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

Then Eben turned and walked out, and Noel followed, because apparently that's what he did now.

Fake dating. For the festival.

This was going to be a disaster.

## Chapter 3: The Performance

The town tour was going well, which meant it was going terribly.

Miranda Chen was delighted by everything. The decorations. The shops. The way Tinsel Town looked like it had been designed by someone who took "festive" as a personal challenge.

She was also delighted by Noel and Eben, which was the terrible part.

"You two are so natural together," she said, snapping another photo as they walked through Evergreen Square.

Natural. Right. Noel felt about as natural as a animatronic elf.

Eben's hand was in his. That was the problem. That was the entire problem.

They were holding hands for the performance. For the optics. For the sponsor who thought they were a couple building traditions together.

Except Eben's hand was warm. And their fingers fit together in a way that felt deliberate. And Noel couldn't stop noticing the way Eben's thumb brushed across his knuckles every few steps, like he wasn't even aware he was doing it.

"Tell me about how you two met," Miranda said, phone still out.

Noel and Eben exchanged a glance.

"Work," Eben said.

"The festival," Noel added.

"Love at first spreadsheet?" Miranda laughed. "That's adorable."

It wasn't love. It was complicated. It was messy. It was—

Eben's hand tightened slightly on his.

Noel's brain went offline.

"Something like that," Noel heard himself say.

They walked through the square. Past the bakery, where Wes waved at them through the window with a knowing look that Noel chose to ignore. Past the craft shop, where someone had hung a banner that said "SUPPORT LOCAL LOVE."

Noel was going to die. He was going to die of irony poisoning right here in Evergreen Square.

Hugh appeared at the edge of the square, coffee in hand, watching them with the expression of someone observing a nature documentary about mating rituals.

"This is *fascinating*," Hugh called out.

"Go away, Hugh," Noel said through his smile.

"Absolutely not. This is better than television."

Miranda laughed. "Friend of yours?"

"Unfortunately," Noel muttered.

Hugh saluted them with his coffee and wandered toward the bakery, still grinning.

*Was this real, or was he just being useful again?*

The thought surfaced unbidden. Eben needed a fake boyfriend. Noel was convenient. Willing. Already entangled.

It wasn't fair to think that. Eben had said—

But Eben hadn't said anything. Not really. Just "I need to think" and a door closing behind him.

Noel smiled for the camera and tried not to spiral.

"Can I get a photo of you two by the tree?" Miranda gestured to the massive Christmas tree in the center of the square.

"Of course," Eben said.

They positioned themselves in front of the tree. Noel tried to figure out what "natural" looked like when you were fake dating someone you'd already slept with and were currently navigating a boundary that was killing you both.

"Closer," Miranda said. "You're a couple! You can touch!"

Eben's arm went around Noel's waist.

Noel stopped breathing.

"Perfect! Now look at each other."

They turned. Their faces were maybe six inches apart. Noel could see the exact moment Eben's expression shifted from professional to something else. Something that looked almost—

The camera clicked.

"Beautiful!" Miranda checked her phone. "Oh, that's lovely. You're looking at each other instead of the camera, but it's so genuine."

Genuine. That was one word for it.

Noel looked at the photo Miranda showed them. In it, they were looking at each other with expressions that were definitely not appropriate for a professional working relationship.

"Great," Noel said weakly.

Eben's arm was still around his waist.

Miranda took a few more photos, chattering about engagement and brand alignment and family values. Noel smiled and nodded and tried very hard not to notice that Eben hadn't let go yet.

"I have a meeting with the Mayor," Miranda said finally. "But I'll see you both at the reception tonight, yes?"

"We'll be there," Eben said.

Miranda walked away, already typing on her phone.

Eben's arm dropped.

Noel immediately missed it, which was a problem.

"That went well," Noel said.

"She bought it."

"Yeah."

They stood there, in front of the Christmas tree, not looking at each other.

"We should—" Eben started.

"Yeah," Noel said.

Neither of them moved.

"This would be easier," Eben said quietly, "if touching you didn't feel like coming home."

Noel's breath caught. "Eben—"

"That was a concerning metaphor." Eben's jaw tightened. "Forget I said that."

"I'm not going to forget that."

"Try."

Eben walked away.

Noel stood in front of the Christmas tree, hand still warm from where Eben had held it, and thought: *We're in so much trouble.*

## Chapter 4: Jealousy Spark

The Garland Cup was busy for a Wednesday afternoon, which Eben supposed made sense given that it was December in Tinsel Town and people needed somewhere warm to recover from aggressive cheerfulness.

He was here for a meeting with Miranda and several local business owners. Noel was here because they were apparently joined at the hip now. For the performance.

The performance was going to kill him.

Eben had spent the last hour watching Noel charm every single person in the room. It was impressive, really. The way Noel could make anyone feel like they were the most interesting person he'd ever met. The way he listened. The way he smiled.

Eben was not jealous. He was simply... observing. Intensely. With his jaw clenched.

"Noel!" A man Eben vaguely recognized from the business association approached. "Great to see you. I wanted to talk about the vendor coordination for Saturday."

"Of course," Noel said, all warmth and professional competence.

The man—Marcus? Martin?—leaned in. Too close. His hand landed on Noel's arm.

Eben's vision went slightly red.

He was not jealous. The man was simply standing too close, speaking too loudly, and existing too aggressively. This wasn't jealousy. This was spatial awareness.

The man laughed at something Noel said. His hand was still on Noel's arm.

Eben stood up.

He crossed the room in four strides. His hand found the small of Noel's back—possessive, obvious, absolutely not subtle.

"Sorry to interrupt," Eben said. His voice was perfectly polite. His hand was not polite at all. "Noel, we need to review the schedule."

Noel's eyes widened slightly. "Oh. Right. Of course."

The man—definitely Marcus—looked between them. "I didn't realize you two were—"

"Together," Eben said. "We are. Together."

"For the festival," Noel added quickly.

"Right. The festival." Marcus stepped back. "I'll catch you later, Noel."

He walked away.

Eben's hand stayed on Noel's back.

"That was interesting," Noel said quietly.

"Standard couple behavior," Eben said.

"Mmm." Noel turned to look at him. "Your hand is still on my back."

"Positioning."

"It wasn't there before he started talking to me."

"Coincidence."

"Eben."

Eben removed his hand. Stepped back. Tried to remember how to be a person who didn't just stake a claim on someone in the middle of a coffee shop.

"We should go," he said.

"We should talk," Noel countered.

"There's nothing to talk about."

"You just got jealous."

"I did not get jealous."

"Your entire face went cold when he touched my arm."

"That's just my face."

"Eben."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. Noel's expression was careful. Hopeful. Guarded.

"Outside," Eben said quietly. "Not here."

Noel nodded.

They left the café. Walked around to the back, where a small alley opened onto a delivery area. Private. Quiet.

"You're jealous," Noel said.

"I'm not jealous."

"Your hand was on my back for ten minutes."

"That's positioning."

"It wasn't there before he started talking to me."

"...Coincidence."

Noel laughed. It wasn't a happy sound. "You're lying."

"I'm maintaining the performance."

"The performance." Noel stepped closer. "Eben. We have rules. Between us, remember? Temporary. Unless you don't want it to be."

The silence stretched.

Eben didn't answer. Couldn't answer. Because the truth was that he didn't want it to be temporary. He didn't want it to be fake. He didn't want to pretend that touching Noel was just for show.

But he also didn't know how to say that without breaking everything.

"Eben," Noel said softly. "I need to know what this is."

"I don't know."

"Then figure it out."

Noel walked away.

Eben stood in the alley, alone, and thought: *I'm in so much trouble.*
