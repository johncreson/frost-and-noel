## Chapter 01: Sponsor Arrives

The sponsor assumed they were a couple. To be fair, they were standing too close together, had matching exhaustion, and were covered in traces of mutual glitter. An understandable mistake.

Noel realized the mistake approximately three seconds after it happened, which was two seconds too late to correct it without making everything worse.

"Oh, you're the couple!" The sponsor representative—Miranda Chen, according to her business card and the way she'd introduced herself four times—beamed at them. "How charming! Mayor Kringle mentioned you two were the heart of the festival."

Noel froze.

Eben froze.

Mayor Kringle, standing behind Miranda, went very pale and made a series of facial expressions that Noel interpreted as *please don't ruin this, I'm begging you.*

"We're—" Noel started.

"Very committed!" The Mayor stepped forward, voice too loud. "To the festival! They're very committed. To the work. Together. As a team."

Miranda's smile didn't waver. "That's wonderful. Family values are very important to our brand. It's so nice to see young people building something together."

Noel wanted to explain that they weren't building anything. They were imploding. Slowly. With excellent logistics.

Instead, he smiled. "Thank you. We're happy to help."

Beside him, Eben made a sound that might have been agreement or might have been internal screaming. Hard to tell.

Miranda pulled out her phone. "I'd love to get some photos for our social media. The two of you coordinating the festival—it's perfect for our messaging."

"Of course," Eben said. His voice was perfectly professional. His hand, however, had found the small of Noel's back, which was not professional at all.

Noel's brain short-circuited.

Miranda took several photos. Noel smiled. Eben smiled. They both looked like they were being held hostage by holiday cheer, which wasn't far from the truth.

"Perfect!" Miranda tucked her phone away. "I'll be here through the weekend observing the events. I'm so excited to see what you two have planned."

She walked away, already typing on her phone.

The Mayor waited exactly five seconds before grabbing both of them by the arms and dragging them into a side office.

"I'm sorry," Mayor Kringle said immediately. "I panicked."

"You panicked," Noel repeated.

"She assumed! And I didn't correct her! And now she thinks you're together, and I—" The Mayor ran a hand through his hair. "This is bad."

"Why is it bad?" Eben's voice was very calm. Too calm. The kind of calm that preceded either violence or a spreadsheet.

"Because our sponsor is very invested in 'family-friendly optics.' They want wholesome. They want community. They want—" The Mayor gestured helplessly. "Young couples building traditions together."

"We're not a couple," Noel said.

"I know that. You know that. But Miranda Chen doesn't know that, and if we tell her now, after I just—" The Mayor looked genuinely distressed. "The sponsorship is significant. It funds half the festival."

Eben and Noel exchanged a look.

It was a complicated look. It contained multitudes. It said *this is a disaster* and *we already slept together* and *we're currently navigating a boundary that's killing us both* and *how is this our life.*

"What are you suggesting?" Eben asked carefully.

The Mayor took a breath. "Three days. She's here through Sunday. If you could just—for the festival—"

"Fake date," Noel said flatly.

"I wouldn't put it that way."

"How would you put it?"

"Strategic partnership presentation?"

"That's fake dating."

The Mayor looked between them. "I know this is asking a lot. But the festival—"

"We'll do it," Eben said.

Noel's head snapped toward him. "We will?"

"For the festival." Eben's expression was unreadable. "Three days. Public appearances only. Strictly professional otherwise."

The Mayor's face lit up. "Really? You'll do it?"

"We'll do it," Noel heard himself say.

Because apparently his mouth had decided to agree with Eben without consulting his brain, which was currently screaming.

The Mayor thanked them profusely and left, probably to go have a stress-induced breakdown in private.

Noel and Eben stood in the office, alone, staring at each other.

"Fake dating," Noel said.

"For the festival," Eben said.

"This is a terrible idea."

"Objectively, yes."

"We're going to do it anyway."

"Apparently."

Noel laughed. It sounded slightly unhinged. "Okay. Okay. Rules. We need rules."

"Agreed."

They looked at each other. Neither moved.

"Public only," Eben said finally. "We act like a couple when the sponsor is around. Otherwise, nothing changes."

"Nothing changes," Noel repeated.

"This is temporary. Just for the visit."

"Temporary. Right." The word tasted like ash. "Anything else?"

Eben's jaw tightened. "This doesn't mean anything."

Noel's chest ached. "Got it."

They were standing too close. Noel could smell Eben's cologne. Could see the tension in his shoulders. Could feel the space between them like a physical thing.

"We should go," Eben said quietly. "She'll be expecting a tour."

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

Then Eben turned and walked out, and Noel followed, because apparently that's what he did now.

Fake dating. For the festival.

This was going to be a disaster.
