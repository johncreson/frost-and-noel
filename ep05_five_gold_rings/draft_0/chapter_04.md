## Chapter 04: Evening Reception

The reception was elegant in the way that sponsor events always were: too many lights, too much food that no one ate, and too many people pretending to have a good time.

Noel was excellent at pretending to have a good time.

Eben, standing beside him in a dark suit that should be illegal, was less excellent but managing.

"Smile," Noel murmured.

"I am smiling."

"You look like you're planning a murder."

"I'm planning several."

Noel bit back a laugh. "We just need to get through the photos. Then we can leave."

"The photos," Eben repeated.

"Miranda wants couple shots for the sponsor's social media."

"Of course she does."

They'd been performing all evening. Hand-holding. Standing too close. Laughing at each other's jokes. It should have felt awkward. It should have felt fake.

It didn't.

That was the problem.

"Noel! Eben!" Miranda appeared with a professional photographer in tow. "Perfect timing. We'd love to get some shots of you two for our campaign."

"Of course," Noel said automatically.

The photographer positioned them near the decorated fireplace. Adjusted the lighting. Made them stand closer.

"This is good," the photographer said. "Now, I want you to look like you're in love."

Noel's brain short-circuited.

Eben's hand tightened on his waist.

"Just... be natural," the photographer said. "Forget the camera. Just look at each other."

They turned. Their eyes met.

Noel forgot how to breathe.

Eben's expression was—soft. Open. The way he'd looked the night they'd slept together. The way he'd looked when he'd said "I want to."

The camera clicked. And clicked again.

"Perfect," the photographer murmured. "That's beautiful. Stay just like that."

Eben's thumb brushed against Noel's hip. A small movement. Probably unconscious.

Noel leaned in without thinking.

The camera kept clicking.

"Wonderful!" The photographer stepped back. "I think we got it. You two are very photogenic together."

Eben's hand dropped. Noel immediately missed it.

Miranda reviewed the photos, beaming. "These are perfect. Exactly the kind of authentic connection our brand wants to showcase."

Authentic. Right.

The problem was that it was authentic. That was the entire problem.

"Can I see?" Noel asked.

Miranda showed them the photos on the camera's display.

In them, they looked—

In love. They looked in love.

Noel's chest ached.

"Great," he said weakly.

Eben was staring at the photos with an expression Noel couldn't read.

"Thank you both so much," Miranda said. "I'll let you enjoy the rest of the evening."

She walked away with the photographer.

Noel and Eben stood by the fireplace, not looking at each other.

"Those photos—" Noel started.

"I know," Eben said quietly.

"We look—"

"I know."

The silence stretched.

"I need some air," Eben said finally.

"Okay."

"Come with me."

It wasn't a question. It also wasn't a command. It was something in between.

Noel followed him.

They slipped out of the reception hall into a small side room. Empty. Quiet. Just them and the muffled sound of the party beyond the door.

Eben turned to face him.

"This isn't working," Eben said.

Noel's stomach dropped. "What isn't working?"

"The rules. The boundaries. The pretending." Eben's jaw tightened. "I can't—"

He stopped. Took a breath.

"You can't what?" Noel asked softly.

"I can't keep pretending this is fake."

Noel's heart was pounding. "Then don't."

"Noel—"

"I'm serious. Stop pretending. Stop setting boundaries that hurt us both. Stop—" Noel's voice cracked. "Stop acting like this doesn't mean anything."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him.

"It means everything," Eben said quietly. "That's the problem."

Noel stepped closer. "That's not a problem."

"I'm leaving in a week."

"I know."

"This can't—"

"I don't care."

Eben's expression cracked. "You should care."

"Well, I don't." Noel reached up, cupped Eben's face. "I want this. I want you. I don't care if it's temporary. I don't care if it's complicated. I just—I need you to stop running."

Eben's hand came up to cover Noel's. "I'm not running."

"You left. You set boundaries. You keep saying this doesn't mean anything."

"I'm terrified," Eben said. "I'm terrified of how much this means."

Noel's breath caught.

"I don't know how to do this," Eben continued. "I don't know how to want someone this much and know I have to leave."

"Then don't leave."

"It's not that simple."

"It could be."

Eben closed his eyes. "Noel—"

"Sit," Eben said quietly.

Noel blinked. "What?"

"Sit." Eben guided him to a chair. "You're exhausted. You've been performing all night. Sit."

Noel sank into the chair without thinking.

Eben knelt in front of him. Took his hands. Looked at them like he was checking for damage.

"You did well tonight," Eben said softly.

Noel's chest felt tight.

"Good," Eben added.

That one word. It shouldn't have undone him. It was just a word. But the way Eben said it—low, approving, like Noel had done something right just by existing—something in Noel's chest unlocked.

His eyes fluttered closed.

Eben's hand came up to cup his face. Thumb brushing his cheek.

"I don't know what I want," Eben said quietly. "But I know I don't want to keep hurting you."

"Then figure it out," Noel said. "Please."

"I will."

They sat there in the quiet room, Eben kneeling in front of Noel, both of them trying to figure out how to want something that felt impossible.

"We should go," Eben said finally.

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

Then Eben stood, offered his hand, and pulled Noel to his feet.

They left together.
