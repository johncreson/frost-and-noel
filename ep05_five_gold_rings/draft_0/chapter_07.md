## Chapter 07: Sponsor Farewell

The final sponsor event was mercifully short.

Miranda gave a speech about community values and authentic partnerships. She showed some of the photos from the week, including several of Noel and Eben that made Noel's chest ache because they looked so—

Real.

They looked real.

"Thank you both for being such wonderful ambassadors for Tinsel Town," Miranda said, shaking their hands. "You're exactly the kind of couple our brand wants to support."

Couple. The word didn't sting anymore.

"Thank you," Noel said.

"We're happy to help," Eben added.

Miranda left with promises to send the final campaign materials and recommendations for future sponsorships.

The Mayor looked relieved enough to cry.

Hugh looked delighted.

"So," Hugh said, appearing at Noel's elbow the moment Miranda was out of earshot. "You two are actually together now, right? Because the pining was getting exhausting."

"We're—" Noel glanced at Eben.

"Together," Eben said firmly. "For the next week."

Hugh's expression shifted. "Oh. The next week."

"He's leaving," Noel said quietly.

"Right." Hugh looked between them. "Well. That's—complicated."

"Understatement," Noel muttered.

"But you're trying?"

"We're trying."

Hugh nodded. "Good. You should try. You're good together."

He walked away, leaving Noel and Eben alone in the emptying hall.

"One week," Eben said quietly.

"One week," Noel agreed.

"What do you want to do with it?"

Noel thought about it. About all the things they could do. All the ways they could spend the time.

"Everything," he said finally. "I want everything."

Eben smiled. "That's a tall order."

"You up for it?"

"Yeah." Eben took his hand. "I'm up for it."

They left the hall together, hand in hand, and Noel thought: *One week. We can do a lot in one week.*

They just had to make it count.
