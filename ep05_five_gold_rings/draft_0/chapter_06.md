## Chapter 06: The Morning After (Again)

Noel woke up in his own bed, which was already an improvement over last time.

He also woke up to a text from Eben, which was definitely an improvement over last time.

*Coffee? -E*

Noel stared at the message for a solid thirty seconds before responding.

*Yes. Where?*

*Your place. I'm outside.*

Noel scrambled out of bed, looked in the mirror, decided his hair was a lost cause, and went to answer the door.

Eben was standing there with two cups of coffee and an expression that suggested he hadn't slept much either.

"Hi," Noel said.

"Hi." Eben handed him a coffee. "Can I come in?"

"Yeah. Of course."

They sat on Noel's couch. Drank coffee. Didn't look at each other.

"So," Noel said finally.

"So," Eben agreed.

"One week."

"One week."

"Starting now?"

"Starting now."

Noel took a breath. "What does that mean? Exactly?"

Eben set his coffee down. Turned to face him. "It means I stop running. It means we stop pretending. It means—" He paused. "It means I want to try. For real. For however long we have."

Noel's chest felt tight. "Okay."

"Okay?"

"Yeah. Okay." Noel smiled. "I can work with one week."

"And after?"

"We'll figure it out."

"You keep saying that."

"Because I believe it."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. "I don't know how you do that."

"Do what?"

"Hope. Even when it's complicated."

"It's a gift," Noel said lightly. "Also a curse. Mostly a curse."

Eben laughed. It was a real laugh. Warm. Unguarded.

Noel's heart did something complicated in his chest.

"So," Eben said. "One week. What do you want to do?"

"Right now?"

"Right now."

Noel set his coffee down. Leaned in. Kissed him.

It was soft. Slow. The kind of kiss that said *we have time* instead of *this is temporary.*

When they pulled apart, Eben was smiling.

"That's a good start," Eben said.

"I thought so."

They spent the morning on Noel's couch. Drinking coffee. Talking. Not talking. Just—being.

It felt normal. Easy. Like they'd been doing this for years instead of days.

Noel's phone buzzed. Hugh. *Sponsor event tonight. You two need to be there. Try not to combust from sexual tension.*

Noel showed Eben the message.

"He's not wrong," Eben said.

"About the event or the tension?"

"Both."

Noel laughed. "We can handle one more sponsor event."

"Can we?"

"We handled the photos. We can handle this."

Eben's expression shifted. "About those photos—"

"They were real," Noel said quietly. "I know. It's okay."

"Is it?"

"Yeah." Noel took his hand. "It's okay to want this. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to not have all the answers."

Eben's hand tightened on his. "One week."

"One week," Noel agreed.

They had one week to figure out if this could be more than temporary.

Noel was going to make it count.
