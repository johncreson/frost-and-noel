## Chapter 08: Hook Ending

Snow fell on Tinsel Town, and Eben Frost walked through it holding Noel Merrick's hand, and thought: *I'm in so much trouble.*

The good kind of trouble. The kind that felt like coming home.

They'd agreed to one week. Seven days. That's all they had.

Eben had spent his entire adult life avoiding exactly this kind of situation. Temporary assignments. Temporary towns. Temporary everything. He didn't do relationships because relationships required permanence, and permanence required staying, and staying required—

"You're thinking too loud," Noel said.

Eben blinked. "What?"

"I can hear you spiraling from here." Noel squeezed his hand. "Stop it."

"I'm not spiraling."

"You're absolutely spiraling."

Eben sighed. "One week."

"One week," Noel agreed. "And then we'll figure it out."

"You keep saying that."

"Because it's true."

"What if we can't figure it out?"

Noel stopped walking. Turned to face him. "Then we'll have had one really good week. And that's more than a lot of people get."

Eben looked at him. Snow was catching in Noel's hair. His cheeks were pink from the cold. He was smiling like he believed every word he was saying.

"How are you so optimistic?" Eben asked.

"Practice," Noel said. "Also denial. Mostly denial."

Eben laughed.

"Come on," Noel said, tugging him forward. "Let's go home."

Home. Noel's apartment. Not Eben's hotel room. Not neutral territory.

Home.

Eben followed him through the snow, hand in hand, and tried not to think about how much he wanted this to be more than temporary.

Tried not to think about how leaving in a week was going to destroy him.

Tried not to think about how he was already planning ways to stay.

"Eben," Noel said softly.

"Yeah?"

"Stop thinking."

"I can't."

"Try."

Noel pulled him into a kiss. Right there in the middle of the snowy street. Soft and sweet and absolutely devastating.

When they pulled apart, Eben was breathless.

"Better?" Noel asked.

"No," Eben said honestly. "But also yes."

Noel smiled. "Good enough."

They walked the rest of the way in comfortable silence.

One week.

Eben had one week to figure out if he could stay. If he wanted to stay. If staying was even possible.

One week to figure out if Noel Merrick was worth upending his entire life for.

He already knew the answer.

The problem was figuring out what to do about it.

Snow fell on Tinsel Town, and Eben Frost held Noel Merrick's hand, and thought: *I'm in so much trouble.*

But for the first time in his life, he didn't want to run from it.
