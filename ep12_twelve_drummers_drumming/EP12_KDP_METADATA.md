## BLURB

The twelfth day of Magic.

The festival's grand finale. The whole town gathered in Evergreen Square. Twelve drummers leading the parade. And Eben Frost, standing in the middle of it all, about to do something absolutely terrifying.

He's going to stay.

Not temporarily. Not conditionally. Forever.

Noel Merrick has spent years being the one who holds Tinsel Town together. Now, as the snow falls and the lights blaze and the whole town cheers, someone is finally holding him.

This is the happily ever after they both earned.

Through glitter emergencies and temporary contracts. Through first kisses and first times. Through fights and separations and the moment Eben finally understood that love isn't a risk to be managed—it's a choice to be made.

Every day. Forever. Starting now.

**Day twelve of twelve. This is where the story really begins.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series. This is the finale—featuring proposal, happily ever after, grumpy-sunshine dynamics, found family, and all the holiday magic.*
