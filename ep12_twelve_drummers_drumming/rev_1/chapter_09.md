# Chapter 9: Epilogue
## POV: Dual

### POV: EBEN

The first morning of the rest of their lives looked a lot like any other morning.

Coffee. Snow outside. Noel hogging the covers and complaining about the cold even though the apartment was perfectly heated.

But it was also completely different.

Because this wasn't a holiday fling. This wasn't temporary. This was the beginning of something Eben had never let himself believe he could have.

He got up first—he always did—and made coffee, and brought two mugs back to bed, and watched Noel blink awake with the slow reluctance of someone who'd been dreaming something good.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" Noel asked, his voice rough with sleep.

"Like what?"

"Like I'm... I don't know. Something special."

Eben set the mugs on the nightstand and climbed back into bed, settling beside Noel with the easy familiarity that still surprised him sometimes. Three days ago, this had seemed impossible. Now it felt inevitable.

"You are something special," he said.

"It's too early for you to be this nice."

"I'll stop if it makes you uncomfortable."

"Don't you dare."

They drank their coffee in bed, propped against the headboard, watching through the window as Tinsel Town went about its post-Christmas business. The festival decorations were still up, but they'd be coming down soon—volunteers already gathering in the square to start the teardown. Back to normal life, whatever that meant now.

"I've been thinking," Noel said.

"Dangerous."

"About what you said. About how you spent years convincing yourself you didn't want this."

Eben felt a flicker of something—not fear, exactly, but the ghost of old fear. A reminder of who he used to be. "Yeah?"

"I did the same thing." Noel stared into his coffee like it held answers. "Convinced myself that being useful was enough. That if I could just keep helping, keep fixing, keep being indispensable—that would be the same as being loved."

"It's not."

"I know that now." Noel looked up, his eyes too bright. "You taught me that. You love me when I'm not being useful. When I'm not organizing or planning or solving problems. When I'm just... here."

"That's the best part." Eben reached out, brushing his thumb across Noel's cheekbone. "The just-here part."

Noel leaned into the touch, his eyes closing. "I never thought I'd have this."

"Neither did I."

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, the coffee growing cold, neither quite ready to get up and start the day. The morning light grew brighter, painting the room in shades of gold, and somewhere outside kids were shrieking with laughter, probably building snow forts.

"What now?" Noel asked eventually.

"Now?" Eben considered. "Now we live. We figure out the rest as we go."

"That's not a plan."

"No." Eben smiled. "It's better."

### POV: NOEL

They got up eventually. Showered—together, which made everything take longer but was absolutely worth it. Made more coffee. Started talking about breakfast and ended up arguing about pancakes versus waffles and forgetting to actually cook anything.

"Waffles are objectively superior," Eben said, for approximately the fifteenth time.

"Waffles require a waffle iron. Which we don't have."

"We can buy a waffle iron."

"At nine in the morning on December 26th?"

"Online shopping exists."

"So you're suggesting we order a waffle iron online and then... wait for it to arrive while we starve?"

"I'm suggesting that we *plan* for future waffles while eating eggs for current breakfast."

Noel stared at him for a long moment, then burst out laughing. "You're insane. I love you. We're having eggs."

Normal things. Small things. The kind of things that added up to a life.

Noel stood at the stove, scrambling eggs, and thought about how he'd gotten here. All the years of performing usefulness, of earning affection through work and sacrifice and never-ending helpfulness. Convincing himself that love was something you had to perform, day after day, in order to deserve.

And now here he was. In a kitchen that was becoming his kitchen. With a man who loved him when he was useless, and when he was annoying, and when he was too much and not enough all at once.

"You're not listening to my waffle argument," Eben said.

"I'm appreciating."

"Me?"

"Yeah." Noel turned off the stove and crossed the kitchen, wrapping his arms around Eben. "You. This. All of it."

Eben's arms came up around him, holding him close. "You're being sentimental again."

"I'm being grateful."

"Same thing." But Eben was smiling—Noel could hear it in his voice.

They stood there for a while, just holding each other. Outside, Tinsel Town sparkled in the morning light—snow and decorations and all the magic that came with a town that took Christmas seriously.

The Twelve Days were over.

Whatever came next was theirs to figure out.

### THE END

They ate their eggs at the kitchen table, knees bumping underneath, already planning which of Noel's things to move over first. They argued about closet space (Eben's closets were suspiciously organized) and bathroom counter real estate (Noel had a lot of products) and whose couch was more comfortable (neither of them would budge).

It was ridiculous. It was mundane. It was perfect.

And when Noel caught Eben looking at him with that soft expression again—the one that said *I can't believe I get to have this*—he felt something bloom in his chest. Something that felt like hope, and peace, and the steady quiet certainty of being exactly where he was supposed to be.

Outside, Tinsel Town woke slowly.

And Noel Merrick—finally, completely—let himself be loved without earning it first.
