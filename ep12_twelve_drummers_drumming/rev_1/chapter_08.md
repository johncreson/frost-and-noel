# Chapter 8
## POV: Dual (Noel → Eben → Noel)

### POV: NOEL

Noel woke on Boxing Day morning to sunlight streaming through unfamiliar windows and the smell of fresh coffee.

He blinked, disoriented for a moment, before the pieces clicked into place. Eben's apartment. Their apartment now. The morning after Christmas, and the morning after... everything.

The bed was warm where Eben should have been, but empty. Noel sat up slowly, listening. Sounds from the kitchen—the clink of mugs, the soft shuffle of bare feet on hardwood, the gurgle of the coffee maker.

Domestic sounds. Comfortable sounds. The sounds of someone who lived here, making coffee for someone they loved.

He found his boxers on the floor and pulled them on, then padded out of the bedroom with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders like a cape.

Eben was in the kitchen, shirtless, making coffee with the focused precision he brought to everything. When he saw Noel, his expression softened into something that made Noel's chest ache.

"Morning."

"Morning." Noel leaned against the doorframe, drinking in the sight of him. Eben Frost, making coffee, in their apartment. Like it was natural. Like it was normal. Like this was their life now.

It was.

Holy shit.

"Coffee's almost ready," Eben said. "You look like you've had a revelation."

"I've had several." Noel crossed the kitchen in three steps and wrapped his arms around Eben from behind, pressing his cheek between Eben's shoulder blades. "This is really happening."

Eben's hand came up to cover Noel's where it rested on his chest. "You said that last night."

"It's still true this morning."

"That's how reality works, yes."

Noel laughed against Eben's skin, feeling the rumble of Eben's answering chuckle.

"Coffee," Eben said firmly, disentangling himself with obvious reluctance. "Then we can have the existential happiness crisis together."

### POV: EBEN

They took their coffee to the window, sitting on the wide ledge with their legs tangled together, watching Tinsel Town wake up.

The Twelve Days were over. The festival was done. And somehow, improbably, everything had worked out.

"What do we do today?" Noel asked, his mug cradled in both hands. "No events. No crises. No impossible logistics."

"We could just... exist."

Noel blinked at him. "Exist?"

"Stay here. Drink coffee. Maybe order food later." Eben shrugged, feeling faintly embarrassed by how much he wanted that. "Be boring together."

"That sounds..." Noel's smile was soft. "Perfect. That sounds perfect."

They sat in comfortable silence, watching the snow-covered town below. Smoke rose from chimneys. Children were already outside, building snowmen and throwing snowballs with the manic energy of kids on winter break. The Christmas tree in Evergreen Square was still standing, though the lights had been turned off for the day, its work finally done.

"We should plan next year," Noel said suddenly.

Eben nearly choked on his coffee. "What?"

"Next year's festival. The Twelve Days. We could start thinking about it now—what worked, what didn't, what we'd do differently if we had to deal with another drum corps breakdown—"

"Noel." Eben set down his mug and turned to face him fully. "The festival has been over for approximately twelve hours. Can we have one day before you start planning the next one?"

"I'm not *planning* planning. I'm just... observing. Making mental notes."

"You're incapable of relaxing."

"I'm very relaxed right now."

"You're thinking about parade routes."

Noel opened his mouth to argue, then closed it again. "...Maybe."

Eben laughed, the sound surprised out of him. "You're impossible."

"You love it."

"I love *you*." The words came out easy now, natural in a way that still surprised him. "Even your inability to stop working."

Noel's expression went soft. "I love you too. Even your terrible joke timing."

"My joke timing is impeccable."

"Your joke timing is how you got us into the flour incident."

"That was *Hugh's* fault—"

They were still bickering when Wes's text came through, inviting them to brunch at the bakery. And then Sam's, asking if they wanted to go for a walk later. And then Mayor Kringle's enthusiastic seasonal greeting, which included far too many exclamation points and a request to discuss "next year's possibilities!!" with two exclamation points and a holiday emoji.

"The town won't leave us alone," Noel observed.

"No." Eben smiled. "They won't."

And honestly? He wouldn't have it any other way.

### POV: NOEL

Later—after brunch at Candle & Crumb, where Wes had made them a special celebratory pastry in the shape of two intertwined hearts; after a walk through the snow-covered town with Sam, who'd given them his quiet blessing in the form of a nod and a "good work"; after Mayor Kringle's slightly unhinged holiday planning meeting, which thankfully only lasted an hour—they ended up back at the apartment, sprawled on the couch with takeout containers scattered around them and some terrible Christmas movie playing on the TV.

"This is good," Noel said, because it kept surprising him that it was. "This. Us. Being boring."

"I told you boring was underrated."

"You never said that."

"I implied it." Eben pulled him closer, Noel's head ending up on his shoulder. "This is what I wanted, you know. All along. Even when I was too scared to admit it."

"What?"

"This." Eben gestured vaguely at the apartment, at them, at the quiet domesticity of it all. "Someone to come home to. Someone to be boring with. Someone who makes the good things better and the bad things bearable."

Noel's throat went tight. "Eben—"

"I spent years convincing myself I didn't want it. That attachment was dangerous, that letting people in just meant getting hurt when they left." Eben's voice was quiet, honest. "And then you showed up with your clipboard and your sunshine and your refusal to let me push you away, and none of those walls worked anymore."

"I'm very persistent."

"You're very impossible to resist."

Noel laughed, leaning up to kiss him. "I'm going to remind you that you said that. Frequently."

"I expected nothing less."

They fell quiet, the movie playing in the background—something with a predictable plot and a guaranteed happy ending—and the snow still falling outside the window.

"Next year," Noel said eventually.

Eben groaned. "You're really not letting that go."

"Not next year's festival. Just—next year." Noel turned to look at him. "We'll be here. Together. Celebrating Christmas together."

"Celebrating Christmas a year in advance seems excessive even for you."

"I'm just saying. This isn't temporary." Noel smiled, soft and sure. "We have time. We have next year, and the year after, and—all of it."

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "All of it."

"All of it."

They kissed, slow and sweet, and Noel felt something settle in his chest. The last of the fear. The last of the doubt.

This was real.

This was theirs.

And it was going to last.
