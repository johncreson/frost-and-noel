# Chapter 1
## POV: Noel

Christmas morning. Tangled in someone you almost lost, in sheets that smell like relief, watching snow fall through the window. Hallmark could never.

Noel woke slowly, consciousness seeping in around the edges like sunlight through curtains. The first thing he registered was warmth—Eben's body curved around his, solid and present and *there*. The second thing was the particular quality of silence that came with fresh snowfall, the world muffled and soft outside the window.

The third thing was that it was Christmas.

He didn't move for a long moment, just lay there cataloging the feeling. Eben's arm heavy across his waist. Eben's breath warm against the back of his neck, slow and even with sleep. The steady rhythm of Eben's heartbeat, a counterpoint to his own. The way their legs were tangled together under the covers, like even in sleep they'd been reaching for each other.

Three days ago, he'd been in this same bed, alone. Staring at the ceiling in the dark, replaying the moment Eben had said *this was never supposed to last* and wondering if he'd imagined everything between them. Wondering if he'd been fooling himself this whole time, seeing something that wasn't there.

But he hadn't imagined it. And yesterday had proven that.

Yesterday had been a lot. The storage room confession. Eben's voice cracking on *I lied*. The repair that had taken hours and honesty and the kind of vulnerability that left you raw. The first "I love you" that had cracked something open in Noel's chest and hadn't stopped aching since—but a good ache. The kind that came from letting yourself feel something too big to hold.

And now this. Christmas morning. Together.

Eben stirred behind him, arm tightening reflexively, and Noel felt his heart do something complicated.

"You're awake," Eben murmured, his voice rough with sleep. "I can hear you thinking."

Noel smiled, even though Eben couldn't see it. "What am I thinking about?"

"Logistics, probably. Whether the parade coordination is finalized. If the volunteers remembered the backup float batteries. Whether the cocoa station has enough—"

"Wrong." Noel turned in Eben's arms, shifting until they were face to face on the pillow, close enough that their noses nearly touched. Eben's eyes were soft, still heavy-lidded, his hair a disaster. There was a pillow crease on his cheek and his jaw was rough with morning stubble.

He looked like something Noel wanted to keep.

He looked like home.

"I was thinking," Noel said quietly, "that this is the best Christmas I've ever had."

Something flickered across Eben's face—surprise, then warmth, then something that looked suspiciously like he might cry. "It's barely started."

"Doesn't matter." Noel's hand came up to cup Eben's face, thumb brushing over his cheekbone, over the pillow crease, over the corner of his mouth. "This part. Right here. This is the best part."

Eben kissed him, soft and slow, morning breath and all. When he pulled back, his eyes were too bright. "Merry Christmas, Noel."

"Merry Christmas."

They lay there for a while longer, neither in any hurry to move. The snow kept falling outside, fat flakes drifting past the window in the pale morning light, and the town was quiet beneath its fresh blanket of white. Somewhere out there, Tinsel Town was starting to stir—families gathering around trees, children tearing into presents, the smell of cinnamon rolls and fresh coffee drifting from a hundred kitchens.

But here, in this bed, wrapped in each other, Noel felt like they had all the time in the world.

Eventually, his stomach made an embarrassing noise, and Eben laughed—a real laugh, open and surprised. "Breakfast?"

"Breakfast," Noel agreed reluctantly. "Then festival."

"One last day."

"One last day."

They got up slowly, moving around each other with an ease that felt earned. Eben made coffee while Noel showered—using Eben's shampoo, which smelled like cedar and made him feel like he was getting away with something. When he emerged, toweling his hair dry, Eben handed him a mug without being asked. The coffee was strong, the way Eben made it, and Noel wrapped his hands around the ceramic and let the warmth seep into his palms.

"I could get used to this," he said, watching Eben move through the kitchen.

Eben glanced over his shoulder. "The coffee?"

"The... all of it." Noel gestured vaguely with his mug. "You. Here. Making coffee like it's a normal thing."

"It could be a normal thing." Eben turned to face him, leaning against the counter with his own mug. "If you want."

The offer was casual, but his eyes were serious. Watchful in the way they got when he was bracing for rejection.

Noel crossed the kitchen and kissed him, slow and deliberate, tasting coffee on his lips. "I want," he said against Eben's mouth. "I want all of it."

Eben's free hand came up to curl around the back of his neck, holding him close for a moment longer. "Good."

They finished their coffee standing in the kitchen, looking out the window at the snow-covered town. The Christmas tree in Noel's living room glowed with soft light, ornaments catching the morning sun. Outside, a neighbor walked past with a dog in a tiny Santa costume. In the distance, they could hear the church bells start to ring.

"Ready?" Eben asked.

"Ready."

One last day of the Twelve Days Festival. One last event. One last crisis to solve, probably, because that was how this worked. Twelve days of impossible challenges, and somehow they'd survived all of them.

But this time, Noel wasn't afraid of whatever came next.

This time, he wasn't doing it alone.

He grabbed his coat from the hook by the door, then paused. Turned back to look at Eben, who was shrugging into his own jacket, his gloves tucked in his pocket where they always were.

"Hey," Noel said.

Eben looked up. "Yeah?"

"I love you."

The words came out easy now. Natural. Like something he'd been waiting his whole life to say.

Eben's smile was soft, private—the smile that was just for Noel. "I love you too."

They walked out into Christmas morning together.
