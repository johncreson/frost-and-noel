# Chapter 5
## POV: Eben

The public claim had been unplanned.

That's what Eben kept thinking, afterward, as the parade officially ended and the celebration shifted from the tree to the bonfire. He hadn't walked into Evergreen Square intending to make a declaration. He hadn't rehearsed words or planned a moment or practiced in front of a mirror like some kind of romantic comedy protagonist.

He'd just... done it.

Because it had needed to be done. Because Noel deserved to know, and so did everyone else. Because after twelve days of pretending this was temporary, Eben was done pretending.

The bonfire crackled in the center of the square, flames leaping toward the darkening sky, casting everyone in warm orange light. The whole town seemed to have gathered—familiar faces and unfamiliar ones, all mixing together in the easy intimacy of shared celebration. The high school drummers had abandoned their instruments and were toasting marshmallows with the enthusiasm of teenagers who'd just been made heroes. Someone had set up a table with graham crackers and chocolate, the makings of s'mores scattered across the surface. Hot cider was being passed around in mismatched mugs, the smell of cinnamon and apple mixing with woodsmoke in the cold air.

Eben stood at the edge of the crowd, watching Noel work the room.

Because even now, even after everything, Noel couldn't quite stop being the event director. He moved through the crowd like water through stones, stopping to chat with volunteers, check on the cocoa station, congratulate the drum line director, make sure everyone was having a good time. He'd always been like this—incapable of turning off the part of his brain that made him responsible for everyone else's happiness.

But every few minutes, his eyes would find Eben's across the fire.

And every time, his smile would go softer. More private. More *his*.

*Mine*, Eben thought, and the word didn't scare him anymore.

"You're staring," Wes said, appearing at his elbow with two cups of cider and the expression of a man who was deeply, profoundly satisfied with the universe.

"I'm observing."

"Same thing, when you're making that face." Wes handed him a cup—warm ceramic, the cider inside fragrant with spices. "Congratulations, by the way. That was quite a moment."

"It was... unplanned."

"The best moments usually are." Wes sipped his cider, his gaze following Eben's to where Noel was now being talked at enthusiastically by the girl with the purple hair, who seemed to be describing her drum solo in great detail. "I've known Noel for three years. I've never seen him like this."

"Like what?"

"Happy." Wes said it simply, like it was obvious. "Really, deeply happy. The kind of happy where you're not worried about losing it because you finally believe you deserve it."

Eben didn't know how to respond to that, so he just nodded.

"You did that," Wes continued. "For whatever it's worth."

"He did it for himself."

"Sure." Wes's smile was knowing. "But you helped. You stayed. That matters."

Eben watched Noel across the fire—the way he laughed at something the drummer said, the way his hand came up to gesture while he talked, the way the firelight caught his hair and made it glow golden. The way he looked up and caught Eben watching, and his whole face softened.

"Don't mess it up," Wes added, but there was no heat in it. More like a formality.

"I'll try not to."

"You'll do more than try." Wes clinked his cup against Eben's. "You already have."

Sam appeared next, because apparently this was the "check on Eben" tour.

He approached without fanfare, holding his own cup of cider, and stood beside Eben in comfortable silence for a long moment. That was Sam's way—he didn't rush, didn't push, just waited until the other person was ready to talk.

"That was good," Sam said finally, his voice low enough not to carry. "The thing you did. With the gloves."

"Thanks."

"I wasn't sure you had it in you. The public declaration thing." Sam shrugged, his expression thoughtful. "You've always been the 'keep it private, keep it controlled' type. I figured you'd work things out with Noel quietly, if you worked them out at all. Behind closed doors. Nobody else's business."

"So did I."

"What changed?"

Eben considered the question. What *had* changed? A week ago, the thought of standing in front of the entire town and declaring his feelings would have made him break out in hives. He'd spent his whole life avoiding exactly that kind of vulnerability, protecting himself from the exposure that came with letting people see what you wanted.

But then Noel had happened. And everything Eben thought he knew about himself had shifted.

"He changed things," Eben said finally. "Noel. He made it worth being brave."

Sam nodded slowly, like that was the answer he'd been expecting. "That's good. That's the right answer."

"Was there a wrong answer?"

"Several." Sam's smile was small but genuine. "But you didn't give them. That's what matters."

He clapped Eben on the shoulder—brief, solid, the acknowledgment of a friend—and walked away to join Wes by the s'mores table. They stood close together, shoulders brushing, the kind of easy intimacy that came from years of being together.

That was what Eben wanted. That comfortable, unshakeable certainty. The knowledge that you belonged to someone and they belonged to you, and nothing was going to change that.

He watched the flames dance for a while longer, thinking about all the ways his life had changed in twelve days.

He'd come to Tinsel Town to run a festival.

He was staying for something much more important.

Noel finally extracted himself from the crowd and made his way to Eben's side, cheeks flushed from the fire and the cold and what looked like sheer joy.

"Hey," Noel said, bumping their shoulders together.

"Hey yourself."

"Having fun?"

"Surprisingly, yes." Eben wrapped an arm around Noel's waist, pulling him close. "You?"

"The best." Noel leaned into him, solid and warm. "This is the best Christmas I've ever had. And yes, I know I already said that this morning, but it keeps getting better, so I'm allowed to keep saying it."

"Fair enough."

They stood there together, watching the bonfire burn, surrounded by the people who had become their people. Wes and Sam at the s'mores table. Hugh holding court near the cider, probably regaling someone with the story of the glove removal. The mayor shaking hands with anyone who stood still long enough. The high school drummers, still on a high from their moment of glory.

Their town. Their life.

Their future.

"What happens now?" Noel asked quietly.

Eben pressed a kiss to his temple. "Now? We celebrate. And then we figure out the rest."

"Together?"

"Together."
