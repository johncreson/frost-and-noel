# Chapter 2
## POV: Dual (Noel → Eben)

### POV: NOEL

Merryweather Hall looked like Christmas had exploded inside it.

Which, to be fair, it had. Twelve days of decoration, each event adding its own layer of garlands and lights and glitter—always the glitter, courtesy of Hugh Everhart's enthusiasm—until the whole building sparkled like the inside of a snow globe. Red ribbons cascaded from the rafters. The massive tree in the corner dripped with ornaments, each one hung by a different volunteer over the past two weeks. Even the tables were wrapped in gold fabric, every surface catching the light.

Noel paused in the doorway, taking it in. Twelve days. Twelve impossible events. And somehow, against all odds, they'd pulled it off.

Well. Almost. One more to go.

"You're blocking traffic," Eben said from behind him, but there was no heat in it. His hand found the small of Noel's back, a casual touch that would have been unthinkable two weeks ago.

"I'm having a moment."

"Have it faster. We're late."

But Eben didn't actually push him forward. Just stood there, close enough that Noel could feel the warmth of him, and let Noel have his moment.

They walked in together, and Noel felt the shift in the room immediately. Heads turning. Whispers starting. The particular quality of attention that meant people were watching not just him, but *them*.

Together. Arriving together. No pretense, no professionalism, just—together.

Mrs. Henderson from the flower shop gave them a knowing smile as they passed. Two of the volunteer coordinators exchanged looks that were entirely too smug. A teenager Noel didn't recognize actually pulled out her phone, probably to text someone about the development.

Small towns. No secrets. Not really.

Mayor Kringle spotted them first. He crossed the room with surprising speed for someone who'd consumed his body weight in festival cookies over the past twelve days, his face split in a grin that could only be described as *relieved*.

"Oh, thank goodness," he said, clutching Noel's hand like a lifeline. "You fixed it."

Noel blinked. "Fixed what?"

"The tension!" The mayor waved a hand expansively. "It was ruining my digestion. Every time you two were in the same room, my stomach started doing things. Very uncomfortable. My doctor was concerned."

"That sounds like a personal problem," Eben said mildly.

"It was a *town* problem." Kringle pointed at both of them with a finger that still had a smear of frosting on it. "And now it's solved. The Christmas spirit is restored. My wife can stop hiding the antacids."

He bustled off before Noel could respond, pausing only to grab another cookie from a passing tray, leaving them standing in the middle of the hall.

"Did he just thank us for fixing his heartburn?" Noel asked.

"I think he thanked us for fixing *us*." Eben's hand found his, fingers lacing together like it was the most natural thing in the world. "He's not wrong."

### POV: EBEN

Hugh appeared out of nowhere, because Hugh always appeared out of nowhere. One moment the space beside Eben was empty; the next, Hugh was there, wearing a sweater that was at least forty percent actual glitter and looking unreasonably smug.

"Well," Hugh said, looking between them with the satisfaction of a man who'd won every bet he'd ever made. "Finally."

"Good morning to you too," Eben said flatly.

"I'm not going to say 'I told you so.'" Hugh's smile widened dangerously. "But I am going to say that I have been *insufferable* about this for days, and now I feel very vindicated."

"You're being insufferable right now."

"Yes, but vindicated insufferable. It hits different." Hugh patted Eben's shoulder with a glitter-covered hand that probably left sparkles on his coat. "Congratulations on pulling your head out of your—"

"Thank you, Hugh."

"—and finally telling the man you're in love with that you're in love with him. Very brave. Very romantic." Hugh clasped his hands together. "I'm proud of you. Like a parent watching their child take their first steps, except the child is a thirty-something man who took *twelve days* to admit his feelings, and the steps were more like a dramatic stumble off an emotional cliff."

Eben was going to kill him. Slowly. With something festive, like a candy cane shiv.

Noel appeared at his elbow, looking amused. "What are we talking about?"

"How proud Hugh is of me," Eben said.

"So proud," Hugh confirmed. "I've already started planning the wedding. Glitter cannons are non-negotiable."

"We've been together for one day."

"And I've had the venue picked out for three weeks." Hugh winked. "I work fast."

"Okay, we're leaving now." Eben grabbed Noel's hand and steered them both away before Hugh could start describing floral arrangements.

But even as they walked toward the volunteer briefing, Eben felt something settle in his chest. The town knew. The town was happy about it. And for once, being seen didn't feel like a threat.

It felt like belonging.

### POV: NOEL

The morning briefing was controlled chaos, as expected.

The Twelve Drummers Drumming event—the finale of the entire festival—was scheduled for this afternoon. The parade would wind through Main Street, ending in Evergreen Square with the drum corps performance, the final tree ceremony, and what Mayor Kringle kept calling "the climactic celebration of municipal joy."

There were a hundred details to manage. Float positioning. Crowd control. Sound equipment. The hot cocoa station placement, which had become a source of surprising controversy between three different vendors. Someone had to coordinate the high school marching band with the professional drum corps. Someone else had to make sure the giant nutcracker float didn't actually catch fire this time.

But for the first time in twelve days, Noel didn't feel like he was drowning in it.

"You're smiling," Wes said, appearing beside him with two pastries and a cup of coffee that smelled like heaven. "It's weird."

"It's Christmas."

"It's been Christmas tone for weeks. You've been actively stressed for most of them." Wes handed him a pastry—something with chocolate and hazelnuts that Noel was going to inhale as soon as he got a free moment. "Something's different."

Noel took a bite, buying time. "I don't know what you mean."

"Uh-huh." Wes glanced across the room, where Eben was deep in conversation with Sam about parade security, their heads bent together over a map of Main Street. "He seems different too. Less..." He mimed walls going up. "You know."

"Maybe."

"You fixed it."

"We're working on it."

"Good enough." Wes nodded slowly, his expression softening into something that looked almost like pride. "You both deserved to stop being idiots about it. The pining was exhausting to watch."

"We weren't pining."

"You were absolutely pining. It was tragic. Sam and I had a whole betting pool going." Wes grinned. "I won forty dollars and a case of wine, by the way. So thank you for that."

"You're welcome?"

"You're very welcome." Wes clapped him on the shoulder. "Now go save the festival one more time. And try not to make heart eyes at your boyfriend in front of the volunteers. It's distracting."

He walked away before Noel could respond, leaving him standing in the middle of the chaos, holding a half-eaten pastry and feeling, for the first time in weeks, like everything might actually be okay.

Across the room, Eben looked up from his conversation with Sam and caught Noel's eye. Smiled—small and private, just for him.

The festival could handle one more day.

He could too.
