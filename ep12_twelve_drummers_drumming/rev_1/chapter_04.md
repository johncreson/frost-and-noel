# Chapter 4
## POV: Dual (Noel → Eben → Noel)

### POV: NOEL

The parade was magic.

Not the controlled, curated magic of a professional production—that had gone out the window with the stranded drum corps. This was messier. More chaotic. More *real*.

The high school drummers led the way down Main Street, their beats slightly uneven but enthusiastic, their faces split with grins that said *we're the heroes now*. The girl with the purple hair was front and center, her snare drum strapped across her chest, leading a rhythm that made the whole crowd clap along. Behind her, the other drummers followed in ragged formation, not quite in step but clearly having the time of their lives.

Behind them came the floats—the lights, the garlands, the giant nutcracker that had definitely not caught fire. The elementary school choir on their winter wonderland float, singing "Jingle Bells" with more enthusiasm than accuracy. The Candle & Crumb Bakery float, where Wes was tossing candy canes to the crowd with alarming force. The Everhart Crafts float, predictably drenched in glitter, with Hugh waving like he was the grand marshal of the whole thing.

And then the town itself, spilling into the street to join the procession. Families in matching Christmas sweaters. Dogs in reindeer antlers. A group of elderly women from the knitting circle, marching with handmade scarves flying like banners.

Everyone was cheering. Everyone was *here*.

Noel stood at the corner of Main and Pine, clipboard in hand (more for show than function at this point), and watched the parade wind through his town.

Their town.

"You're supposed to be coordinating," Eben said, appearing beside him.

"I'm supervising."

"You're watching."

"That's a kind of supervising." Noel didn't take his eyes off the parade. "Look at it. Twelve days of chaos, and this is what we got."

Eben was quiet for a moment, following Noel's gaze. The sun was starting to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink and gold, and the Christmas lights that lined Main Street were flickering on, one by one. The drummers' rhythm echoed off the buildings, and somewhere in the crowd, someone started singing along to whatever the choir was attempting.

"It's good," Eben said finally.

"It's really good."

Their hands found each other. Easy. Natural. Right there on Main Street where anyone could see.

Noel didn't pull away. Neither did Eben.

Someone in the crowd wolf-whistled—probably Mrs. Henderson, who had zero shame about these things—and Noel felt his face heat, but he was laughing too. "So much for discretion."

"Discretion was never our strong suit."

"*Your* strong suit."

"Not anymore." Eben's thumb traced a circle on the back of Noel's hand. "Not with you."

### POV: EBEN

The parade ended in Evergreen Square, the floats circling the massive Christmas tree while the high school drummers launched into a final flourish that was more enthusiasm than precision.

The crowd loved it anyway. The crowd loved *everything*—the lights, the music, the chaos, the sheer joyful absurdity of a town that had devoted twelve days to celebrating Christmas with the intensity of a competitive sport.

Eben stood at the edge of the square, Noel's hand still in his, watching it all with a feeling he still couldn't quite name.

Not discomfort. Not the itch to retreat. Just... something full. Something that pressed against his ribs and made it hard to breathe, but in a good way.

He'd spent his whole life holding back. Keeping his distance. Making sure his exit was always in sight, because that was how you survived when people left. Don't get too comfortable. Don't let anyone matter too much. Don't be the one who stays while everyone else moves on.

But these people hadn't left.

*Noel* hadn't left.

And standing here, in the middle of a Christmas parade he'd helped save, watching the town that had somehow become his town celebrate around him, Eben understood something he hadn't quite let himself believe before.

This wasn't temporary.

It never had been.

And it was time to make sure everyone knew it.

"There you are." Noel appeared at his side, looking flushed and happy and so beautiful it made Eben's chest ache. "Mayor wants a speech. Technically he wants *me* to give a speech, but I told him you should do it."

"Absolutely not."

"It would be very romantic."

"I'm not giving a speech."

"What about a small speech? A speech-lite? A brief oration?"

"Noel."

But even as he protested, Eben felt something shifting in his chest. Mayor Kringle was heading their way, looking expectant. The crowd was starting to gather around the tree, faces upturned, waiting for the final moment of the festival.

This was it. The end of the Twelve Days. The last scene.

And Eben knew, with sudden clarity, exactly what he wanted to do.

"Actually," he said quietly, surprising himself, "give me a minute."

### POV: NOEL

"No speech from Mr. Frost," Mayor Kringle said, looking disappointed but unsurprised. "I had a feeling. Very reserved, that one. No matter—I'll say something suitably inspiring. Something about community. Spirit. The meaning of—"

He kept talking, but Noel wasn't listening.

He was watching Eben, who had gone very still beside him, his expression focused in a way Noel recognized. Eben was thinking. Planning. Preparing for something.

"What are you doing?" Noel asked quietly.

Eben didn't answer. But his hands moved—slowly, deliberately—to his gloves.

And he started to remove them.

One finger at a time.

The movement was careful, precise, almost ritualistic. The way Eben did everything. But there was something different about it now. Something intentional in a way that made Noel's breath catch.

The gloves had always been part of Eben. Leather, perfectly fitted, creating a barrier between him and the world. In twelve days, Noel had never seen him take them off in public. They were armor. Protection. A way of keeping everyone at arm's length.

And now he was removing them.

Hugh, who had materialized nearby (of course he had), went absolutely still. His eyes widened. "Oh," he said softly. "He's serious."

The gloves came off. Both of them. Eben tucked them carefully into his pocket without looking away from Noel.

And then—in front of Mayor Kringle, and Hugh, and Wes, and Sam, and the gathering crowd, and the entire town of Tinsel Town—Eben Frost took Noel's hand.

Bare skin against bare skin.

The crowd went quiet. Even Mayor Kringle stopped mid-sentence, his mouth hanging open.

"Eben?" Noel's voice came out as barely a whisper.

Eben's eyes were dark and steady and full of something that looked like the opposite of fear. "I should have done this earlier."

"Done what?"

"This." Eben lifted their clasped hands, making sure everyone could see. "This isn't temporary, Noel. This was never temporary. I was just too scared to admit it."

Noel's heart was pounding so hard he could feel it in his throat. "Eben—"

"Let me finish." Eben's thumb brushed over Noel's knuckles, the touch achingly gentle. "I spent my whole life keeping my walls up. Keeping my gloves on. Making sure no one got close enough to matter, because losing people who matter is the only thing that's ever really hurt."

He paused, swallowing hard, and Noel could see the effort it took him to keep going. To be this vulnerable, this exposed, in front of everyone.

"And then I met you," Eben continued. "And you got through anyway. No matter how hard I pushed, you just kept—being *you*. Being warm, and kind, and so goddamn stubborn about believing in people."

Noel laughed, a wet sound that was dangerously close to a sob. "Stubborn is one word for it."

"Determined." Eben's smile was soft, private, even though they were standing in front of the whole town. "Brave. You made me want to be brave too."

He lifted their hands again, pressing a kiss to Noel's knuckles. The gesture was so tender, so unexpectedly romantic from someone who claimed not to do romance, that Noel felt tears prick at his eyes.

"This isn't temporary," Eben said, his voice clear enough to carry across the square. "This is real. This is permanent. And I wanted everyone to know."

The crowd erupted.

Cheering. Applause. Someone—definitely Wes—was crying loudly and unashamedly. Mayor Kringle was beaming like he'd personally arranged the whole thing. Mrs. Henderson was dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief. Hugh was rapidly texting with one hand while clutching his heart with the other, probably documenting the moment for posterity.

But Noel barely noticed any of it.

All he could see was Eben. Eben, who had taken off his walls in front of the whole town. Eben, whose bare hand was still holding his like he never wanted to let go.

"You're insane," Noel managed.

"Probably." Eben was still smiling. "But you love me anyway."

"Yeah," Noel said, pulling him into a kiss right there in Evergreen Square, in front of everyone, while the Christmas tree glowed and the crowd cheered and the snow started falling like the universe itself approved. "I really do."

The kiss was soft at first, then deeper, and somewhere in the crowd Hugh shouted "Finally!" at a volume that was entirely unnecessary. The high school drummers launched into an impromptu celebratory beat. Mayor Kringle was saying something about the culmination of community spirit, but nobody was listening because everyone was too busy cheering for Noel and Eben.

When they finally pulled apart, both breathless, Noel saw that half the town had their phones out.

"We're going to be on every social media platform in this county," he said.

"Good." Eben kissed his forehead. "I want the whole world to know."

"You're getting sappy."

"It's Christmas. I'm allowed."

They stood there, hands still clasped, as the sun set behind the Christmas tree and the lights flickered on all around them. The parade was over. The festival was done.

And this—whatever this was—was just beginning.
