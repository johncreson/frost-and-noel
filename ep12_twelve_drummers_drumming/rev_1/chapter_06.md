# Chapter 6
## POV: Noel

The bonfire burned lower, the crowd thinning as families drifted home and the night deepened. The high school drummers had been collected by their parents, reluctantly departing with promises to tell everyone at school about their heroic moment. The vendors had packed up their cider and cocoa. Even Mayor Kringle had finally left, though not before shaking Noel's hand approximately fifty times and making pointed comments about "next year's planning."

But Noel didn't want to leave. Not yet.

He stood at the edge of the light, close enough to feel the fire's warmth on his face, and felt something he couldn't quite name settle into his bones.

Peace, maybe. Or satisfaction. The knowledge that twelve days of chaos had somehow coalesced into something beautiful, and he'd been part of making it happen.

But it was more than that.

It was the feeling of standing in the town that had always been his home and finally, truly, feeling like he belonged there.

Not because he was useful. Not because he'd organized the festival. Not because he'd solved a dozen crises and managed a hundred volunteers and kept everything from falling apart through sheer force of will.

Just... because.

He belonged because this was his town and these were his people and this was his life, and for the first time, he didn't have to earn any of it.

Eben appeared beside him, close enough that their shoulders brushed. "You're being reflective."

"I'm being peaceful."

"Is that different from reflective?"

"Reflective has more thinking. This is just..." Noel gestured vaguely at the fire, at the square, at the town around them. "Feeling."

Eben was quiet for a moment, watching the flames dance. The light painted his face in shades of orange and gold, catching the angles of his cheekbones, the curve of his jaw. He looked softer than Noel had ever seen him. Open.

"What are you feeling?" Eben asked finally.

Good question. Noel tried to find the words.

"Happy," he said. "Tired. Relieved that the festival didn't fall apart. Glad that you're here." He paused, then added more quietly: "Scared, a little. That this is as good as it gets, and it's all downhill from here."

"That's dark."

"You asked."

Eben's hand found his, fingers lacing together. The touch was warm, grounding, real. His thumb traced slow circles on the back of Noel's hand.

"It's not downhill from here," Eben said. "It's just... the next part."

"What's the next part?"

"I don't know yet." Eben squeezed his hand. "But I want to find out. With you."

Noel felt his throat tighten. "That's very eloquent for someone who claimed he doesn't do speeches."

"I said I don't do *public* speeches. Private ones are fine."

"Is this a private speech?"

"This is a conversation." Eben turned to face him, his expression serious in the firelight. "Noel. About what comes after."

Noel's heart rate picked up. "After?"

"The festival ends tonight. Tomorrow is... just a regular day. No events, no crises, no excuses to see each other constantly." Eben's voice was steady, but Noel could see the tension in his jaw. "I don't want that to change. What we have."

"Neither do I."

"Good." Eben took a breath. "Then move in with me."

Noel stared at him. "What?"

"Move in with me." Eben said it again, like repetition would make it less insane. "My place has better water pressure."

"That's your argument?"

"It's a compelling argument." A ghost of a smile crossed Eben's face. "Also, I love you, and I want to wake up next to you every morning, and the idea of you going back to your apartment when mine is right there feels stupid."

"You love me."

"We established that yesterday. Keep up."

Noel laughed, the sound startled out of him, and felt something crack open in his chest—not breaking, but releasing. All the fear he'd been carrying, all the doubt, all the *what if this doesn't last* anxiety that had been lurking in the back of his mind.

Eben wasn't going anywhere. Eben wanted him to stay.

Eben wanted to build a *life* with him.

"Okay," Noel said.

Eben blinked. "Okay?"

"Yeah. Okay." Noel took Eben's other hand, so they were facing each other properly, connected by both hands. "Let's do that. Let's move in together. Let's figure out what comes next."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that." Noel stepped closer, until they were chest to chest, forehead to forehead. "The water pressure argument was very compelling."

Eben laughed against his mouth, and then they were kissing—slow and sweet and full of promise. The fire crackled beside them, the last of its warmth seeping into the cold night air. Somewhere in the distance, church bells were ringing midnight.

Christmas was over.

Their life together was beginning.

When they pulled apart, Eben's eyes were bright. "Ready to go home?"

Home. Their home. The word settled into Noel's chest like a gift.

"Ready."

They walked away from the dying fire together, leaving the public behind and stepping into the private. Eben's hand was warm in his, and the snow was starting to fall again, and the streets of Tinsel Town were empty and quiet and glowing with Christmas lights.

It wasn't temporary.

It never had been.

And now they had all the time in the world to prove it.
