# Chapter 1
## POV: Noel

Christmas morning. Tangled in someone you almost lost, in sheets that smell like relief, watching snow fall through the window. Hallmark could never.

Noel woke slowly, consciousness seeping in around the edges like sunlight through curtains. The first thing he registered was warmthâ€”Eben's body curved around his, solid and present and *there*. The second thing was the particular quality of silence that came with fresh snowfall, the world muffled and soft outside the window.

The third thing was that it was Christmas.

He didn't move for a long moment, just lay there cataloging the feeling. Eben's arm heavy across his waist. Eben's breath warm against the back of his neck. The steady rhythm of Eben's heartbeat, a counterpoint to his own.

Yesterday had been a lot. The repair. The confessions. The first "I love you" that had cracked something open in Noel's chest and hadn't stopped aching sinceâ€”but a good ache. The kind that came from letting yourself feel something too big to hold.

And now this. Christmas morning. Together.

"You're awake," Eben murmured, his voice rough with sleep. "I can hear you thinking."

Noel smiled, even though Eben couldn't see it. "What am I thinking about?"

"Logistics, probably. Whether the tree lighting went smoothly last night. If the volunteers remembered toâ€”"

"Wrong." Noel turned in Eben's arms, shifting until they were face to face on the pillow, close enough that their noses nearly touched. Eben's eyes were soft, still heavy-lidded, his hair a disaster. He looked like something Noel wanted to keep.

He looked like home.

"I was thinking," Noel said quietly, "that this is the best Christmas I've ever had."

Something flickered across Eben's faceâ€”surprise, then warmth, then something that looked suspiciously like he might cry. "It's barely started."

"Doesn't matter." Noel's hand came up to cup Eben's face, thumb brushing over his cheekbone. "This part. Right here. This is the best part."

Eben kissed him, soft and slow, morning breath and all. When he pulled back, his eyes were too bright. "Merry Christmas, Noel."

"Merry Christmas."

They lay there for a while longer, neither in any hurry to move. The snow kept falling outside, the town quiet beneath its fresh blanket of white. Somewhere out there, Tinsel Town was starting to stirâ€”families gathering around trees, children tearing into presents, the smell of cinnamon rolls and fresh coffee drifting from a hundred kitchens.

But here, in this bed, wrapped in each other, Noel felt like they had all the time in the world.

Eventually, his stomach made an embarrassing noise, and Eben laughedâ€”a real laugh, open and surprised. "Breakfast?"

"Breakfast," Noel agreed reluctantly. "Then festival."

"One last day."

"One last day."

They got up slowly, moving around each other with an ease that felt earned. Eben made coffee while Noel found clean clothes. The domesticity of itâ€”the *normalcy*â€”made something in Noel's chest go tight with want.

He'd never had this. Not really. Not someone who stayed without needing him to earn it first.

The coffee was good. Strong, the way Eben made it, and Noel wrapped his hands around the mug and let the warmth seep into his palms. Outside, the snow was still falling, and the Christmas tree in Noel's living room glowed with soft light.

"Ready?" Eben asked.

"Ready."

One last day of the Twelve Days Festival. One last event. One last crisis to solve, probably, because that was how this worked.

But this time, Noel wasn't afraid of it.

This time, he wasn't doing it alone.

## POV: Dual (Noel â†’ Eben)

### POV: NOEL

Merryweather Hall looked like Christmas had exploded inside it.

Which, to be fair, it had. Twelve days of decoration, each event adding its own layer of garlands and lights and glitterâ€”always the glitter, courtesy of Hugh Everhart's enthusiasmâ€”until the whole building sparkled like the inside of a snow globe. Red ribbons cascaded from the rafters. The massive tree in the corner dripped with ornaments. Even the tables were wrapped in gold fabric, every surface catching the light.

Noel paused in the doorway, taking it in. Twelve days. Twelve impossible events. And somehow, against all odds, they'd pulled it off.

Well. Almost. One more to go.

"You're blocking traffic," Eben said from behind him, but there was no heat in it.

"I'm having a moment."

"Have it faster. We're late."

They walked in together, and Noel felt the shift in the room immediately. Heads turning. Whispers starting. The particular quality of attention that meant people were watching not just him, but *them*.

Together. Arriving together. No pretense, no professionalism, justâ€”together.

Mayor Kringle spotted them first. He crossed the room with surprising speed for someone who'd eaten as many festival cookies as he had, his face split in a grin that could only be described as *relieved*.

"Oh, thank goodness," he said, clutching Noel's hand like a lifeline. "You fixed it."

Noel blinked. "Fixed what?"

"The tension!" The mayor waved a hand expansively. "It was ruining my digestion. Every time you two were in the same room, my stomach started doing things. Very uncomfortable."

"That sounds like a personal problem," Eben said mildly.

"It was a *town* problem." Kringle pointed at both of them. "And now it's solved. The Christmas spirit is restored. My acid reflux can finally rest."

He bustled off before Noel could respond, leaving them standing in the middle of the hall.

"Did he just thank us for fixing his heartburn?" Noel asked.

"I think he thanked us for fixing *us*." Eben's hand found the small of Noel's back, warm and grounding. "He's not wrong."

---

### POV: EBEN

Hugh appeared out of nowhere, because Hugh always appeared out of nowhere. One moment the space beside Eben was empty; the next, Hugh was there, wearing a sweater that was at least forty percent actual glitter and looking unreasonably smug.

"Well," Hugh said, looking between them with the satisfaction of a man who'd won a bet. "Finally."

"Good morning to you too," Eben said flatly.

"I'm not going to say 'I told you so.'" Hugh's smile widened. "But I am going to say that I have been *insufferable* about this for days, and now I feel very vindicated."

"You're being insufferable right now."

"Yes, but vindicated insufferable. It hits different." Hugh patted Eben's shoulder. "Congratulations on pulling your head out of yourâ€”"

"Thank you, Hugh."

"â€”and finally telling the man you're in love with that you're in love with him. Very brave. Very romantic. I'm proud of you."

Eben was going to kill him. Slowly. With something festive, like a candy cane shiv.

Noel appeared at his elbow, looking amused. "What are we talking about?"

"How proud Hugh is of me," Eben said.

"So proud," Hugh confirmed. "Like a parent watching their child take their first steps, except the child is a thirty-something man who took *twelve days* to admit his feelings, and the steps were more likeâ€”"

"Okay, we're leaving now." Eben grabbed Noel's hand and steered them both away before Hugh could finish whatever torture metaphor he was constructing.

But even as they walked toward the volunteer briefing, Eben felt something settle in his chest. The town knew. The town was happy about it. And for once, being seen didn't feel like a threat.

It felt like belonging.

---

### POV: NOEL

The morning briefing was chaos, as expected.

The Twelve Drummers Drumming eventâ€”the finale of the entire festivalâ€”was scheduled for this afternoon. The parade would wind through Main Street, ending in Evergreen Square with the drum corps performance, the final tree ceremony, and what Mayor Kringle kept calling "the climactic celebration of municipal joy."

There were a hundred details to manage. Float positioning. Crowd control. Sound equipment. The hot cocoa station placement (a source of surprising controversy, as it turned out).

But for the first time in twelve days, Noel didn't feel like he was drowning in it.

"You're smiling," Wes said, appearing beside him with two pastries and the expression of a man delivering Important Information. "It's weird."

"It's Christmas."

"It's been Christmas tone for weeks. You've been actively stressed for most of them." Wes handed him a pastry. "Something's different."

Noel took a bite, buying time. "I don't know what you mean."

"Uh-huh." Wes glanced across the room, where Eben was deep in conversation with Sam about parade security. "He seems different too. Less..." He mimed walls going up. "You know."

"Maybe."

"You fixed it."

"We're working on it."

Wes nodded slowly, his expression softening into something that looked almost like pride. "Good. You both deserved to stop being idiots about it."

He walked away before Noel could respond, leaving him standing in the middle of the chaos, holding a half-eaten pastry and feeling, for the first time in weeks, like everything might actually be okay.

The festival could handle one more day.

He could too.
# Chapter 3
## POV: Noel

The crisis hit two hours before the parade was supposed to start.

Noel was in Evergreen Square, checking the staging area for the tenth time, when his phone buzzed with a message that made his stomach drop.

*DRUM CORPS BUS BREAKDOWN. STUCK 40 MILES OUT. NO ETA.*

For a moment, he just stared at the screen, willing the words to rearrange themselves into something less catastrophic. The Twelve Drummers Drumming parade. The finale of the entire festival. The event that literally had *drums* in the name.

And the drummers weren't coming.

"What's wrong?"

Eben appeared at his elbow, reading the tension in Noel's shoulders with unnerving accuracy. Noel showed him the phone. Watched Eben's jaw tighten as he processed the information.

"Okay," Eben said, his voice calm in a way that Noel knew meant he was already running calculations. "Options."

"There are no options. The drum corps was the centerpiece. We don't have backup drums. We don't have backup *drummers*." Noel could hear his own voice rising and forced himself to breathe. "This is a disaster."

"It's a problem," Eben corrected. "Problems have solutions."

"Name one."

Eben was quiet for a moment, his eyes scanning the square. The staging area was full of parade floats and volunteers, everyone bustling with Christmas Eve energy, blissfully unaware that the whole event was about to collapse.

"The high school band," Eben said.

"What?"

"The high school band. They have a drum line. They performed at the tree lighting ceremonyâ€”Day One."

Noel's brain scrambled to catch up. Day One. The tree lighting. The local kids who'd filled in when the original performer had gotten food poisoning from questionable eggnog.

"They were good," Noel said slowly.

"They were available on short notice. They might still be." Eben was already pulling out his phone. "I have the band director's number from the backup contact list."

Of course he did. Because Eben was Eben, and Eben had contingencies for contingencies.

"Even if they agree, we'd need to rearrange the parade formation," Noel said, his mind racing through logistics. "The drum corps was supposed to lead. If it's high schoolers, they'll needâ€”"

"Different positioning. More crowd control at the high school parents section. Adjusted sound check." Eben nodded, already texting. "We've done harder."

Noel stared at him. "We've done harder?"

"Day Five. The ice sculpture meltdown. Day Eight. The caroling chaos. Day Tenâ€”" Eben paused, something complicated flickering across his face. "Well. Day Ten had its own problems."

They both knew what he meant. Day Ten had been the rupture. The collapse. The moment everything had broken between them.

"This is easier than Day Ten," Noel said quietly.

Eben met his eyes. "Yeah. It is."

---

The next hour was controlled chaos.

Eben reached the band director, whoâ€”miraculouslyâ€”confirmed that most of the drum line could be mobilized within the hour. They were high schoolers who'd just been told they could be the heroes of the Christmas parade; they moved fast.

Meanwhile, Noel coordinated the parade reshuffling while simultaneously fielding panicked questions from volunteers, Mayor Kringle, and several confused float operators who couldn't understand why everything was changing.

But here was the thing: it worked.

Not perfectly. Not elegantly. But it worked.

Because Noel knew the logistics, and Eben knew the contingencies, and together they could see the whole pictureâ€”the moving pieces, the potential failures, the solutions that weren't obvious until you looked at them from two angles at once.

"Drum line confirmed," Eben said, appearing beside him with an efficiency that shouldn't have been attractive but absolutely was. "Arriving in thirty. Band director is bringing the parents, which means we've got extra volunteers."

"I moved them to front position," Noel said. "The empty space from the adult corps will be hidden by the float with the giant nutcracker."

"The nutcracker float that almost caught fire yesterday?"

"It didn't catch fire. It *smoldered*."

"Reassuring."

But Eben was smilingâ€”a small, private thingâ€”and Noel felt something warm bloom in his chest.

They'd done it. Again. Together.

The crowd was already gathering along Main Street, families bundled in coats and scarves, children waving homemade banners. Nobody knew how close they'd come to disaster. Nobody needed to.

Because Noel and Eben had handled it.

That was what they did now.

---

The high school drum line arrived with ten minutes to spare, tumbling out of cars and minivans with the chaotic energy of teenagers who'd just been told they were important. Their uniforms were slightly mismatchedâ€”some in school colors, others in hastily borrowed parade gearâ€”but their drums gleamed, and their faces were bright with excitement.

"You saved the parade," Mayor Kringle said, appearing at Noel's elbow with the expression of a man who'd been very worried about his Christmas legacy. "You and Mr. Frost. I knew I hired the right team."

"You didn't hire us," Noel pointed out. "You voluntold us."

"Semantics." The mayor waved a hand. "The point is, you came through. Like always."

He bustled off to greet the drum line parents, and Noel turned to find Eben watching with something like amusement.

"We came through," Eben said. "Like always."

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Too late."

Noel laughed, the sound bright and free, and for a momentâ€”standing in the chaos of the parade staging, surrounded by volunteers and drummers and the relentless Christmas cheer of Tinsel Townâ€”he felt something he hadn't felt in twelve days of festival madness.

Peace.

Not the quiet kind. Not the still kind.

The kind that came from knowing you could handle whatever came next.

Because you weren't handling it alone.
# Chapter 4
## POV: Dual (Noel â†’ Eben)

### POV: NOEL

The parade was magic.

Not the controlled, curated magic of a professional productionâ€”that had gone out the window with the stranded drum corps. This was messier. More chaotic. More *real*.

The high school drummers led the way down Main Street, their beats slightly uneven but enthusiastic, their faces split with grins that said *we're the heroes now*. Behind them came the floatsâ€”the lights, the garlands, the giant nutcracker that had definitely not caught fireâ€”and then the town itself, spilling into the street to join the procession.

Everyone was cheering. Everyone was *here*.

Noel stood at the corner of Main and Pine, clipboard in hand (more for show than function at this point), and watched the parade wind through his town.

Their town.

"You're supposed to be coordinating," Eben said, appearing beside him.

"I'm supervising."

"You're watching."

"That's a kind of supervising." Noel didn't take his eyes off the parade. "Look at it. Twelve days of chaos, and this is what we got."

Eben was quiet for a moment, following Noel's gaze. The sun was starting to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, and the Christmas lights that lined Main Street were flickering on, one by one. The drummers' rhythm echoed off the buildings, and somewhere in the crowd, someone started singing.

"It's good," Eben said finally.

"It's really good."

Their hands found each other. Easy. Natural. Right there on Main Street where anyone could see.

Noel didn't pull away. Neither did Eben.

Someone in the crowd wolf-whistled, and Noel felt his face heat, but he was laughing too. "So much for discretion."

"Discretion was never our strong suit."

"*Your* strong suit."

"Not anymore."

---

### POV: EBEN

The parade ended in Evergreen Square, the floats circling the massive Christmas tree while the high school drummers launched into a final flourish that was more enthusiasm than precision.

The crowd loved it anyway. The crowd loved *everything*â€”the lights, the music, the chaos, the sheer joyful absurdity of a town that had devoted twelve days to celebrating Christmas with the intensity of a competitive sport.

Eben stood at the edge of the square, watching it all with a feeling he still couldn't quite name.

Not discomfort. Not the itch to retreat. Just... something full. Something that pressed against his ribs and made it hard to breathe, but in a good way.

He'd spent his whole life holding back. Keeping his distance. Making sure his exit was always in sight, because that was how you survived when people left.

But these people hadn't left.

*Noel* hadn't left.

And standing here, in the middle of a Christmas parade he'd helped save, watching the town that had somehow become his town celebrate around him, Eben understood something he hadn't quite let himself believe before.

This wasn't temporary.

It never had been.

And it was time to make sure everyone knew it.

"There you are." Noel appeared at his side, looking flushed and happy and so beautiful it made Eben's chest ache. "Mayor wants a speech. Technically he wants *me* to give a speech, but I told him you should do it."

"Absolutely not."

"It would be very romantic."

"I'm not giving a speech."

"What about a small speech? A speech-lite?"

"Noel."

But even as he protested, Eben felt something shifting in his chest. Mayor Kringle was heading their way, looking expectant. The crowd was starting to gather around the tree, faces upturned, waiting for the final moment.

This was it. The end of the festival. The last scene.

And Eben knew, with sudden clarity, exactly what he wanted to do.

---

### POV: NOEL

"No speech from Mr. Frost," Mayor Kringle said, looking disappointed but unsurprised. "I had a feeling. No matterâ€”I'll say something suitably inspiring. Something about community. Spirit. The meaning ofâ€”"

He kept talking, but Noel wasn't listening.

He was watching Eben, who had gone very still beside him, his expression focused in a way Noel recognized. Eben was thinking. Planning. Preparing for something.

"What are you doing?" Noel asked quietly.

Eben didn't answer. But his hands movedâ€”slowly, deliberatelyâ€”to his gloves.

And he started to remove them.

One finger at a time.

The movement was careful, precise, almost ritualistic. The way Eben did everything. But there was something different about it now. Something intentional in a way that made Noel's breath catch.

Hugh, who had materialized nearby (of course he had), went absolutely still. "Oh," he said softly. "He's serious."

The gloves came off. Both of them. Eben tucked them into his pocket without looking away from Noel.

And thenâ€”in front of Mayor Kringle, and Hugh, and the gathering crowd, and the entire town of Tinsel Townâ€”Eben Frost took Noel's hand.

Bare skin against bare skin.

The crowd went quiet.

"Eben?" Noel's voice came out as barely a whisper.

Eben's eyes were dark and steady and full of something that looked like the opposite of fear. "I should have done this earlier."

"Done what?"

"This." Eben lifted their clasped hands, making sure everyone could see. "This isn't temporary, Noel. This was never temporary. I was just too scared to admit it."

Noel's heart was pounding so hard he could feel it in his throat. "Ebenâ€”"

"Let me finish." Eben's thumb brushed over Noel's knuckles, the touch achingly gentle. "I spent my whole life keeping my walls up. Keeping my gloves on. Making sure no one got close enough to matter, because losing people who matter is the only thing that's ever really hurt."

He paused, swallowing hard.

"And then I met you. And you got through anyway. No matter how hard I pushed, you just keptâ€”being *you*. Being warm, and kind, and so goddamn stubborn about believing in people."

Noel laughed, a wet sound that was dangerously close to a sob. "Stubborn is one word for it."

"Determined." Eben's smile was soft, private, even though they were standing in front of the whole town. "Brave. You made me want to be brave too."

He lifted their hands again, pressing a kiss to Noel's knuckles.

"This isn't temporary," Eben said, his voice clear enough to carry. "This is real. This is permanent. And I wanted everyone to know."

The crowd erupted.

Cheering. Applause. Someoneâ€”probably Wesâ€”was crying loudly. Mayor Kringle was beaming like he'd personally arranged the whole thing. Hugh was rapidly texting, probably documenting the moment for posterity.

But Noel barely noticed any of it.

All he could see was Eben. Eben, who had taken off his walls in front of the whole town. Eben, whose bare hand was still holding his like he never wanted to let go.

"You're insane," Noel managed.

"Probably." Eben was still smiling. "But you love me anyway."

"Yeah," Noel said, pulling him into a kiss right there in Evergreen Square, in front of everyone, while the Christmas tree glowed and the crowd cheered and the snow started falling like the universe itself approved. "I really do."
# Chapter 5
## POV: Eben

The public claim had been unplanned.

That's what Eben kept thinking, afterward, as the crowd dispersed and the celebration shifted from the tree to the bonfire. He hadn't walked into Evergreen Square intending to make a declaration. He hadn't rehearsed words or planned a moment. He'd just... done it.

Because it had needed to be done.

Because Noel deserved to know, and so did everyone else.

The bonfire crackled in the center of the square, flames leaping toward the darkening sky, casting everyone in warm orange light. The whole town seemed to have gatheredâ€”familiar faces and unfamiliar ones, all mixing together in the easy intimacy of shared celebration. Someone had set up a table with marshmallows and long skewers; someone else was passing around cups of something that smelled like hot cider and tasted like joy.

Eben stood at the edge of the crowd, watching Noel work the room.

Because even now, even after everything, Noel couldn't quite stop being the event director. He moved through the crowd like he belonged thereâ€”which he didâ€”stopping to chat with volunteers, check on logistics, make sure everyone was having a good time.

But every few minutes, his eyes would find Eben's across the fire.

And every time, his smile would go softer. More private.

*Mine*, Eben thought, and the word didn't scare him anymore.

"You're staring," Wes said, appearing at his elbow with two cups of cider and the expression of a man who was deeply satisfied with the universe.

"I'm observing."

"Same thing, when you're making that face." Wes handed him a cup. "Congratulations, by the way. That was quite a moment."

"It was... unplanned."

"The best moments usually are." Wes sipped his cider, his gaze following Eben's to where Noel was now being talked at enthusiastically by Mayor Kringle. "He's happy, you know. Really happy. I haven't seen him like this in years."

Eben didn't know how to respond to that, so he just nodded.

"Don't mess it up," Wes added, but there was no heat in it. More like a formality.

"I'll try not to."

"You'll do more than try." Wes clinked his cup against Eben's. "You already have."

---

Sam appeared next, because apparently this was the "check on Eben" tour.

"That was good," Sam said, his voice low enough not to carry. "The thing you did. With the gloves."

"Thanks."

"I wasn't sure you had it in you. The public declaration thing." Sam shrugged, his expression thoughtful. "You've always been the 'keep it private, keep it controlled' type. I figured you'd work things out with Noel quietly, if you worked them out at all."

"So did I."

"What changed?"

Eben considered the question. What *had* changed? A week ago, the thought of standing in front of the entire town and declaring his feelings would have made him break out in hives. He'd spent his whole life avoiding exactly that kind of vulnerability, protecting himself from the exposure that came with letting people see what you wanted.

But then...

"He changed things," Eben said finally. "Noel. He made it worth being brave."

Sam nodded slowly. "That's good. That's the right answer."

"Was there a wrong answer?"

"Several." Sam's smile was small but genuine. "But you didn't give them. That's what matters."

He walked away to join Wes by the marshmallow table, and Eben was left standing by the fire, watching the flames dance, thinking about all the ways his life had changed in twelve days.

He'd come to Tinsel Town to run a festival.

He was staying for something much more important.
# Chapter 6
## POV: Noel

The bonfire burned lower, the crowd thinning as families drifted home and the night deepened. But Noel didn't want to leave. Not yet.

He stood at the edge of the light, watching the flames, and felt something he couldn't quite name settle into his bones.

Peace, maybe. Or satisfaction. The knowledge that twelve days of chaos had somehow coalesced into something beautiful, and he'd been part of making it happen.

But it was more than that.

It was the feeling of standing in the town that had always been his home and finally, truly, feeling like he belonged there.

Not because he was useful. Not because he'd organized the festival. Just... because.

Eben appeared beside him, close enough that their shoulders brushed. "You're being reflective."

"I'm being peaceful."

"Is that different from reflective?"

"Reflective has more thinking. This is just..." Noel gestured vaguely at the fire, at the square, at the town around them. "Feeling."

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "What are you feeling?"

Good question. Noel tried to find the words.

"Happy," he said finally. "Tired. Relieved that the festival didn't fall apart. Glad that you're here." He paused, then added more quietly: "Scared, a little. That this is as good as it gets, and it's all downhill from here."

"That's dark."

"You asked."

Eben's hand found his, fingers lacing together. The touch was warm, grounding, real.

"It's not downhill from here," Eben said. "It's just... the next part."

"What's the next part?"

"I don't know yet." Eben squeezed his hand. "But I want to find out. With you."

Noel felt his throat tighten. "That's very eloquent for someone who claimed he doesn't do speeches."

"I said I don't do *public* speeches. Private ones are fine."

"Is this a private speech?"

"This is a conversation." Eben turned to face him, his expression serious in the firelight. "Noel. About what comes after."

Noel's heart rate picked up. "After?"

"The festival ends tonight. Tomorrow is... just a regular day. No events, no crises, no excuses to see each other constantly." Eben's voice was steady, but Noel could see the tension in his jaw. "I don't want that to change. What we have."

"Neither do I."

"Good." Eben took a breath. "Then move in with me."

Noel stared at him. "What?"

"Move in with me." Eben said it again, like repetition would make it less insane. "My place has better water pressure."

"That's your argument?"

"It's a compelling argument." A ghost of a smile crossed Eben's face. "Also, I love you, and I want to wake up next to you every morning, and the idea of you going back to your apartment when mine is right there feels stupid."

"You love me."

"We established that yesterday. Keep up."

Noel laughed, the sound startled out of him, and felt something crack open in his chestâ€”not breaking, but releasing. All the fear he'd been carrying, all the doubt, all the *what if this doesn't last* anxiety that had been lurking in the back of his mind.

Eben wasn't going anywhere. Eben wanted him to stay.

Eben wanted to build a *life* with him.

"Okay," Noel said.

Eben blinked. "Okay?"

"Yeah. Okay." Noel pulled him closer, until they were chest to chest, forehead to forehead. "Let's do that. Let's move in together. Let's figure out what comes next."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that." Noel kissed him, soft and sure. "The water pressure argument was very compelling."

Eben laughed against his mouth, and they stood there by the dying fire, wrapped around each other, making plans for a future that finally felt real.
# Chapter 7
## POV: Dual (Eben â†’ Noel)

### POV: EBEN

They walked home through the quiet streets, snow crunching under their boots, their breath misting in the cold air. The town was settling into Christmas nightâ€”lights in windows, families together, the aftermath of celebration softening into peace.

Eben's apartment was dark when they arrived, but warm; he'd left the heat on before the parade. Noel stood in the doorway for a moment, looking around like he was seeing it for the first time.

"So," Noel said. "This is home now."

"If you want it to be."

"I want it to be." Noel turned to face him, his expression soft in the dim light. "I want all of it. The apartment, the terrible water pressure you lied aboutâ€”"

"My water pressure is excellent."

"â€”the mornings, the arguments about coffee, the figuring it out." He stepped closer, until they were chest to chest. "I want everything, Eben."

"Good." Eben's hands settled on Noel's hips, pulling him closer. "Because you're stuck with me now."

The kiss that followed was slow and warm, the kind of kiss that came from knowing there was no rush. No crisis. No festival to run. Just the two of them, in their apartment, with all the time in the world.

Eben backed Noel toward the bedroom, not breaking the kiss, feeling Noel smile against his mouth when they bumped into the doorframe.

"Graceful," Noel said.

"We've got twelve days of practice. You'd think we'd be better at this by now."

"Who says we're not?"

---

### POV: NOEL

The laughter came first.

That's what surprised Noelâ€”the joy of it. After weeks of tension and repair and fragile hope, there was something almost giddy about being here, in Eben's bedroom, with nothing to worry about except each other.

"Remember Day One?" Eben asked, pulling Noel's sweater over his head with careful hands.

"The tree lighting disaster?"

"The one where I thought you were the most annoying person I'd ever met."

"Charming."

"You were." Eben kissed his shoulder. "Annoyingly charming. I couldn't figure out how to handle you."

"And now?"

"Now I've given up trying to handle you." Eben's smile was soft, private. "I'm just going to love you instead."

Noel's breath caught. "That'sâ€”very romantic for someone who claims not to be romantic."

"I contain multitudes." Eben guided him toward the bed, gentle but sure. "Also, you make it easy."

They fell together onto the sheets, tangling in the way that had become familiarâ€”learned over eleven days and one very intense night. But tonight was different. Tonight there was no desperation, no repair, no fear underneath the wanting.

Just joy.

"Remember the flour?" Noel asked, because he couldn't help it, as Eben's hands mapped paths he already knew.

"I'm still finding glitter."

"That's not flour."

"Hugh is a menace." Eben kissed him, swallowing the laughter. "But I'd do it all again. Every chaotic day. Every crisis. Every moment where I wanted to run but didn't."

"Why?"

"Because it led here." Eben's eyes were dark and serious. "To you. To us. To this."

Noel pulled him down, kissing him like the answer to a question he'd been afraid to ask.

This was their first Christmas together.

First of many.

---

### POV: EBEN

Afterward, they lay tangled in the sheets, sweat-damp and breathless, watching the snow fall past the window.

"That was good," Noel said, his voice sleepy and satisfied.

"Just good?"

"Very good. Extremely good." Noel turned his head, pressing a kiss to Eben's shoulder. "Life-alteringly good."

"Now you're just flattering me."

"Is it working?"

Eben laughed, the sound rumbling through his chest. "Yes."

They lay in comfortable silence for a while, Noel's head on Eben's chest, Eben's fingers tracing patterns on Noel's shoulder. The apartment was quiet around them, the only sounds their breathing and the soft hiss of snow against the window.

"Hey," Noel said quietly. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For choosing me." Noel's voice was soft, vulnerable. "For staying. For being brave enough to do the thing with the gloves."

"You're thanking me for taking off my gloves."

"I'm thanking you for what it meant." Noel propped himself up on one elbow, looking down at Eben with an expression that made something tight loosen in Eben's chest. "You let people see. You let *me* see. That's... that's not nothing, Eben."

Eben was quiet for a moment, letting the truth of it settle.

"I spent my whole life keeping my walls up," he said finally. "Keeping people at a distance. Because if nobody gets close, nobody can hurt you when they leave."

"And now?"

"Now I understand that the walls weren't protecting me. They were just keeping me alone." He reached up, brushing a strand of hair from Noel's forehead. "You showed me what I was missing."

Noel's eyes were too bright. "You're going to make me cry."

"It's Christmas. Crying is allowed."

Noel laughed, leaning down to kiss himâ€”soft and sweet and full of promise.

"This is really happening," Noel said.

"It's really happening."

"It's not temporary."

Eben's heart swelled. "No. It never was."

They fell asleep like that, wrapped around each other, warm and safe and finally, completely, home.
# Chapter 8
## POV: Dual (Noel leads)

### POV: NOEL

Noel woke on Boxing Day morning to sunlight streaming through unfamiliar windows and the smell of fresh coffee.

He blinked, disoriented for a moment, before the pieces clicked into place. Eben's apartment. Their apartment now. The morning after Christmas, and the morning after... everything.

The bed was warm where Eben should have been, but empty. Noel sat up slowly, listening. Sounds from the kitchenâ€”the clink of mugs, the soft shuffle of bare feet on hardwood.

He found his boxers on the floor and pulled them on, then padded out of the bedroom with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Eben was in the kitchen, shirtless, making coffee with the focused precision he brought to everything. When he saw Noel, his expression softened into something that made Noel's chest ache.

"Morning."

"Morning." Noel leaned against the doorframe, drinking in the sight of him. Eben Frost, making coffee, in their apartment. Like it was natural. Like it was normal. Like this was their life now.

It was.

Holy shit.

"Coffee's almost ready," Eben said. "You look like you've had a revelation."

"I've had several." Noel crossed the kitchen in three steps and wrapped his arms around Eben from behind, pressing his cheek between Eben's shoulder blades. "This is really happening."

Eben's hand came up to cover Noel's where it rested on his chest. "You said that last night."

"It's still true this morning."

"That's how reality works, yes."

Noel laughed against Eben's skin, feeling the rumble of Eben's answering chuckle.

"Coffee," Eben said firmly, disentangling himself with obvious reluctance. "Then we can have the existential happiness crisis together."

### POV: EBEN

They took their coffee to the window, sitting on the wide ledge with their legs tangled together, watching Tinsel Town wake up.

The Twelve Days were over. The festival was done. And somehow, improbably, everything had worked out.

"What do we do today?" Noel asked, his mug cradled in both hands. "No events. No crises. No impossible logistics."

"We could just... exist."

Noel blinked at him. "Exist?"

"Stay here. Drink coffee. Maybe order food later." Eben shrugged, feeling faintly embarrassed by how much he wanted that. "Be boring together."

"That sounds..." Noel's smile was soft. "Perfect. That sounds perfect."

They sat in comfortable silence, watching the snow-covered town below. Smoke rose from chimneys. Children were already outside, playing in the fresh powder. The Christmas tree in Evergreen Square was still standing, though the lights had been turned off, its work finally done.

"We should plan next year," Noel said suddenly.

Eben nearly choked on his coffee. "What?"

"Next year's festival. The Twelve Days. We could start thinking about it nowâ€”what worked, what didn't, what we'd do differentlyâ€”"

"Noel." Eben set down his mug and turned to face him fully. "The festival has been over for approximately twelve hours. Can we have one day before you start planning the next one?"

"I'm not *planning* planning. I'm just... observing. Making mental notes."

"You're incapable of relaxing."

"I'm very relaxed right now."

"You're thinking about parade routes."

Noel opened his mouth to argue, then closed it again. "...Maybe."

Eben laughed, the sound surprised out of him. "You're impossible."

"You love it."

"I love *you*." The words came out easy now, natural in a way that still surprised him. "Even your inability to stop working."

Noel's expression went soft. "I love you too. Even your terrible joke timing."

"My joke timing is impeccable."

"Your joke timing is how you got us into the flour incident."

"That was *Hugh's* faultâ€”"

They were still bickering when Wes's text came through, inviting them to brunch. And then Sam's, asking if they wanted to go for a walk later. And then Mayor Kringle's enthusiastic seasonal greeting, which included far too many exclamation points and a request to discuss "next year's possibilities."

The town wasn't going to leave them alone. Their found family wasn't going to let them disappear into their new apartment and never emerge.

Honestly? Eben wouldn't have it any other way.

---

### POV: NOEL

Laterâ€”after brunch, after the walk, after Mayor Kringle's slightly unhinged holiday planning meetingâ€”they ended up back at the apartment, sprawled on the couch with takeout containers scattered around them and some terrible Christmas movie playing on the TV.

"This is good," Noel said, because it kept surprising him that it was. "This. Us. Being boring."

"I told you boring was underrated."

"You never said that."

"I implied it." Eben pulled him closer, Noel's head ending up on his shoulder. "This is what I wanted, you know. All along. Even when I was too scared to admit it."

"What?"

"This." Eben gestured vaguely at the apartment, at them, at the quiet domesticity of it all. "Someone to come home to. Someone to be boring with. Someone who makes the good things better and the bad things bearable."

Noel's throat went tight. "Ebenâ€”"

"I spent years convincing myself I didn't want it. That attachment was dangerous, that letting people in just meant getting hurt when they left." Eben's voice was quiet, honest. "And then you showed up, and none of those walls worked anymore."

"I'm very persistent."

"You're very impossible to resist."

Noel laughed, leaning up to kiss him. "I'm going to remind you that you said that. Frequently."

"I expected nothing less."

They fell quiet, the movie playing in the background, the snow still falling outside.

"Next year," Noel said eventually.

Eben groaned. "You're really not letting that go."

"Not next year's festival. Justâ€”next year." Noel turned to look at him. "We'll be here. Together. Planning Christmas together."

"Planning Christmas a year in advance seems excessive even for you."

"I'm just saying. This isn't temporary." Noel smiled, soft and sure. "We have time. We have next year, and the year after, andâ€”all of it."

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "All of it."

"All of it."

They kissed, slow and sweet, and Noel felt something settle in his chest. The last of the fear. The last of the doubt.

This was real.

This was theirs.

And it was going to last.
# Chapter 9: Epilogue
## POV: Dual

### POV: EBEN

The first morning of the rest of their lives looked a lot like any other morning.

Coffee. Snow outside. Noel hogging the covers and complaining about the cold even though the apartment was perfectly heated.

Eben got up firstâ€”he always didâ€”and made coffee, and brought two mugs back to bed, and watched Noel blink awake with the slow reluctance of someone who'd been dreaming something good.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" Noel asked, his voice rough with sleep.

"Like what?"

"Like I'm... I don't know. Something special."

Eben set the mugs on the nightstand and climbed back into bed, settling beside Noel with the easy familiarity that still surprised him sometimes.

"You are something special," he said.

"It's too early for you to be this nice."

"I'll stop if it makes you uncomfortable."

"Don't you dare."

They drank their coffee in bed, propped against the headboard, watching through the window as Tinsel Town went about its post-Christmas business. The festival decorations were still up, but they'd be coming down soonâ€”back to normal life, whatever that meant now.

"I've been thinking," Noel said.

"Dangerous."

"About what you said. About how you spent years convincing yourself you didn't want this."

Eben felt a flicker of somethingâ€”not fear, exactly, but the ghost of old fear. "Yeah?"

"I did the same thing." Noel stared into his coffee like it held answers. "Convinced myself that being useful was enough. That if I could just keep helping, keep fixing, keep being indispensableâ€”that would be the same as being loved."

"It's not."

"I know that now." Noel looked up, his eyes too bright. "You taught me that. You love me when I'm not being useful. When I'm just... here."

"That's the best part." Eben reached out, brushing his thumb across Noel's cheekbone. "The just-here part."

Noel leaned into the touch, his eyes closing. "I never thought I'd have this."

"Neither did I."

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, the coffee growing cold, neither quite ready to get up and start the day.

"What now?" Noel asked eventually.

"Now?" Eben considered. "Now we live. We figure out the rest as we go."

"That's not a plan."

"No." Eben smiled. "It's better."

---

### POV: NOEL

They got up eventually. Showered. Made more coffee. Started talking about breakfast and ended up arguing about pancakes versus waffles and forgetting to actually cook anything.

Normal things. Small things. The kind of things that added up to a life.

Noel stood in the kitchen, watching Eben gesture emphatically about waffle superiority, and felt something bloom in his chest.

He'd spent years chasing approval. Earning affection through work and sacrifice and never-ending helpfulness. Convincing himself that love was something you had to perform, day after day, in order to deserve.

And now here he was. In a kitchen that was becoming his kitchen. With a man who loved him when he was useless, and when he was annoying, and when he was too much and not enough all at once.

"You're not listening," Eben said.

"I'm appreciating."

"Me?"

"Yeah." Noel crossed the kitchen and wrapped his arms around Eben, pressing his face into the curve of his neck. "You. This. All of it."

Eben's arms came up around him, holding him close. "You're being sentimental."

"I'm being grateful."

"Same thing." But Eben was smilingâ€”Noel could hear it in his voice.

They stood there for a while, just holding each other. Outside, Tinsel Town sparkled in the morning lightâ€”snow and decorations and all the magic that came with a town that took Christmas seriously.

The Twelve Days were over. Whatever came next was theirs to figure out.

---

### THE END

Outside, Tinsel Town woke slowly, and Noel Merrickâ€”finally, completelyâ€”let himself be loved without earning it first.
