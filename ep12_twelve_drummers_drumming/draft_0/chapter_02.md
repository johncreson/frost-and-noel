# Chapter 2
## POV: Dual (Noel → Eben)

### POV: NOEL

Merryweather Hall looked like Christmas had exploded inside it.

Which, to be fair, it had. Twelve days of decoration, each event adding its own layer of garlands and lights and glitter—always the glitter, courtesy of Hugh Everhart's enthusiasm—until the whole building sparkled like the inside of a snow globe. Red ribbons cascaded from the rafters. The massive tree in the corner dripped with ornaments. Even the tables were wrapped in gold fabric, every surface catching the light.

Noel paused in the doorway, taking it in. Twelve days. Twelve impossible events. And somehow, against all odds, they'd pulled it off.

Well. Almost. One more to go.

"You're blocking traffic," Eben said from behind him, but there was no heat in it.

"I'm having a moment."

"Have it faster. We're late."

They walked in together, and Noel felt the shift in the room immediately. Heads turning. Whispers starting. The particular quality of attention that meant people were watching not just him, but *them*.

Together. Arriving together. No pretense, no professionalism, just—together.

Mayor Kringle spotted them first. He crossed the room with surprising speed for someone who'd eaten as many festival cookies as he had, his face split in a grin that could only be described as *relieved*.

"Oh, thank goodness," he said, clutching Noel's hand like a lifeline. "You fixed it."

Noel blinked. "Fixed what?"

"The tension!" The mayor waved a hand expansively. "It was ruining my digestion. Every time you two were in the same room, my stomach started doing things. Very uncomfortable."

"That sounds like a personal problem," Eben said mildly.

"It was a *town* problem." Kringle pointed at both of them. "And now it's solved. The Christmas spirit is restored. My acid reflux can finally rest."

He bustled off before Noel could respond, leaving them standing in the middle of the hall.

"Did he just thank us for fixing his heartburn?" Noel asked.

"I think he thanked us for fixing *us*." Eben's hand found the small of Noel's back, warm and grounding. "He's not wrong."

### POV: EBEN

Hugh appeared out of nowhere, because Hugh always appeared out of nowhere. One moment the space beside Eben was empty; the next, Hugh was there, wearing a sweater that was at least forty percent actual glitter and looking unreasonably smug.

"Well," Hugh said, looking between them with the satisfaction of a man who'd won a bet. "Finally."

"Good morning to you too," Eben said flatly.

"I'm not going to say 'I told you so.'" Hugh's smile widened. "But I am going to say that I have been *insufferable* about this for days, and now I feel very vindicated."

"You're being insufferable right now."

"Yes, but vindicated insufferable. It hits different." Hugh patted Eben's shoulder. "Congratulations on pulling your head out of your—"

"Thank you, Hugh."

"—and finally telling the man you're in love with that you're in love with him. Very brave. Very romantic. I'm proud of you."

Eben was going to kill him. Slowly. With something festive, like a candy cane shiv.

Noel appeared at his elbow, looking amused. "What are we talking about?"

"How proud Hugh is of me," Eben said.

"So proud," Hugh confirmed. "Like a parent watching their child take their first steps, except the child is a thirty-something man who took *twelve days* to admit his feelings, and the steps were more like—"

"Okay, we're leaving now." Eben grabbed Noel's hand and steered them both away before Hugh could finish whatever torture metaphor he was constructing.

But even as they walked toward the volunteer briefing, Eben felt something settle in his chest. The town knew. The town was happy about it. And for once, being seen didn't feel like a threat.

It felt like belonging.

### POV: NOEL

The morning briefing was chaos, as expected.

The Twelve Drummers Drumming event—the finale of the entire festival—was scheduled for this afternoon. The parade would wind through Main Street, ending in Evergreen Square with the drum corps performance, the final tree ceremony, and what Mayor Kringle kept calling "the climactic celebration of municipal joy."

There were a hundred details to manage. Float positioning. Crowd control. Sound equipment. The hot cocoa station placement (a source of surprising controversy, as it turned out).

But for the first time in twelve days, Noel didn't feel like he was drowning in it.

"You're smiling," Wes said, appearing beside him with two pastries and the expression of a man delivering Important Information. "It's weird."

"It's Christmas."

"It's been Christmas tone for weeks. You've been actively stressed for most of them." Wes handed him a pastry. "Something's different."

Noel took a bite, buying time. "I don't know what you mean."

"Uh-huh." Wes glanced across the room, where Eben was deep in conversation with Sam about parade security. "He seems different too. Less..." He mimed walls going up. "You know."

"Maybe."

"You fixed it."

"We're working on it."

Wes nodded slowly, his expression softening into something that looked almost like pride. "Good. You both deserved to stop being idiots about it."

He walked away before Noel could respond, leaving him standing in the middle of the chaos, holding a half-eaten pastry and feeling, for the first time in weeks, like everything might actually be okay.

The festival could handle one more day.

He could too.
