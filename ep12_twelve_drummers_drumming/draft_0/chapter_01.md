# Chapter 1
## POV: Noel

Christmas morning. Tangled in someone you almost lost, in sheets that smell like relief, watching snow fall through the window. Hallmark could never.

Noel woke slowly, consciousness seeping in around the edges like sunlight through curtains. The first thing he registered was warmth—Eben's body curved around his, solid and present and *there*. The second thing was the particular quality of silence that came with fresh snowfall, the world muffled and soft outside the window.

The third thing was that it was Christmas.

He didn't move for a long moment, just lay there cataloging the feeling. Eben's arm heavy across his waist. Eben's breath warm against the back of his neck. The steady rhythm of Eben's heartbeat, a counterpoint to his own.

Yesterday had been a lot. The repair. The confessions. The first "I love you" that had cracked something open in Noel's chest and hadn't stopped aching since—but a good ache. The kind that came from letting yourself feel something too big to hold.

And now this. Christmas morning. Together.

"You're awake," Eben murmured, his voice rough with sleep. "I can hear you thinking."

Noel smiled, even though Eben couldn't see it. "What am I thinking about?"

"Logistics, probably. Whether the tree lighting went smoothly last night. If the volunteers remembered to—"

"Wrong." Noel turned in Eben's arms, shifting until they were face to face on the pillow, close enough that their noses nearly touched. Eben's eyes were soft, still heavy-lidded, his hair a disaster. He looked like something Noel wanted to keep.

He looked like home.

"I was thinking," Noel said quietly, "that this is the best Christmas I've ever had."

Something flickered across Eben's face—surprise, then warmth, then something that looked suspiciously like he might cry. "It's barely started."

"Doesn't matter." Noel's hand came up to cup Eben's face, thumb brushing over his cheekbone. "This part. Right here. This is the best part."

Eben kissed him, soft and slow, morning breath and all. When he pulled back, his eyes were too bright. "Merry Christmas, Noel."

"Merry Christmas."

They lay there for a while longer, neither in any hurry to move. The snow kept falling outside, the town quiet beneath its fresh blanket of white. Somewhere out there, Tinsel Town was starting to stir—families gathering around trees, children tearing into presents, the smell of cinnamon rolls and fresh coffee drifting from a hundred kitchens.

But here, in this bed, wrapped in each other, Noel felt like they had all the time in the world.

Eventually, his stomach made an embarrassing noise, and Eben laughed—a real laugh, open and surprised. "Breakfast?"

"Breakfast," Noel agreed reluctantly. "Then festival."

"One last day."

"One last day."

They got up slowly, moving around each other with an ease that felt earned. Eben made coffee while Noel found clean clothes. The domesticity of it—the *normalcy*—made something in Noel's chest go tight with want.

He'd never had this. Not really. Not someone who stayed without needing him to earn it first.

The coffee was good. Strong, the way Eben made it, and Noel wrapped his hands around the mug and let the warmth seep into his palms. Outside, the snow was still falling, and the Christmas tree in Noel's living room glowed with soft light.

"Ready?" Eben asked.

"Ready."

One last day of the Twelve Days Festival. One last event. One last crisis to solve, probably, because that was how this worked.

But this time, Noel wasn't afraid of it.

This time, he wasn't doing it alone.
