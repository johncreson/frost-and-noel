# Chapter 6
## POV: Noel

The bonfire burned lower, the crowd thinning as families drifted home and the night deepened. But Noel didn't want to leave. Not yet.

He stood at the edge of the light, watching the flames, and felt something he couldn't quite name settle into his bones.

Peace, maybe. Or satisfaction. The knowledge that twelve days of chaos had somehow coalesced into something beautiful, and he'd been part of making it happen.

But it was more than that.

It was the feeling of standing in the town that had always been his home and finally, truly, feeling like he belonged there.

Not because he was useful. Not because he'd organized the festival. Just... because.

Eben appeared beside him, close enough that their shoulders brushed. "You're being reflective."

"I'm being peaceful."

"Is that different from reflective?"

"Reflective has more thinking. This is just..." Noel gestured vaguely at the fire, at the square, at the town around them. "Feeling."

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "What are you feeling?"

Good question. Noel tried to find the words.

"Happy," he said finally. "Tired. Relieved that the festival didn't fall apart. Glad that you're here." He paused, then added more quietly: "Scared, a little. That this is as good as it gets, and it's all downhill from here."

"That's dark."

"You asked."

Eben's hand found his, fingers lacing together. The touch was warm, grounding, real.

"It's not downhill from here," Eben said. "It's just... the next part."

"What's the next part?"

"I don't know yet." Eben squeezed his hand. "But I want to find out. With you."

Noel felt his throat tighten. "That's very eloquent for someone who claimed he doesn't do speeches."

"I said I don't do *public* speeches. Private ones are fine."

"Is this a private speech?"

"This is a conversation." Eben turned to face him, his expression serious in the firelight. "Noel. About what comes after."

Noel's heart rate picked up. "After?"

"The festival ends tonight. Tomorrow is... just a regular day. No events, no crises, no excuses to see each other constantly." Eben's voice was steady, but Noel could see the tension in his jaw. "I don't want that to change. What we have."

"Neither do I."

"Good." Eben took a breath. "Then move in with me."

Noel stared at him. "What?"

"Move in with me." Eben said it again, like repetition would make it less insane. "My place has better water pressure."

"That's your argument?"

"It's a compelling argument." A ghost of a smile crossed Eben's face. "Also, I love you, and I want to wake up next to you every morning, and the idea of you going back to your apartment when mine is right there feels stupid."

"You love me."

"We established that yesterday. Keep up."

Noel laughed, the sound startled out of him, and felt something crack open in his chest—not breaking, but releasing. All the fear he'd been carrying, all the doubt, all the *what if this doesn't last* anxiety that had been lurking in the back of his mind.

Eben wasn't going anywhere. Eben wanted him to stay.

Eben wanted to build a *life* with him.

"Okay," Noel said.

Eben blinked. "Okay?"

"Yeah. Okay." Noel pulled him closer, until they were chest to chest, forehead to forehead. "Let's do that. Let's move in together. Let's figure out what comes next."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that." Noel kissed him, soft and sure. "The water pressure argument was very compelling."

Eben laughed against his mouth, and they stood there by the dying fire, wrapped around each other, making plans for a future that finally felt real.
