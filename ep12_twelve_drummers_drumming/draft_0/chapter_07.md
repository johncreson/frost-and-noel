# Chapter 7
## POV: Dual (Eben → Noel)

### POV: EBEN

They walked home through the quiet streets, snow crunching under their boots, their breath misting in the cold air. The town was settling into Christmas night—lights in windows, families together, the aftermath of celebration softening into peace.

Eben's apartment was dark when they arrived, but warm; he'd left the heat on before the parade. Noel stood in the doorway for a moment, looking around like he was seeing it for the first time.

"So," Noel said. "This is home now."

"If you want it to be."

"I want it to be." Noel turned to face him, his expression soft in the dim light. "I want all of it. The apartment, the terrible water pressure you lied about—"

"My water pressure is excellent."

"—the mornings, the arguments about coffee, the figuring it out." He stepped closer, until they were chest to chest. "I want everything, Eben."

"Good." Eben's hands settled on Noel's hips, pulling him closer. "Because you're stuck with me now."

The kiss that followed was slow and warm, the kind of kiss that came from knowing there was no rush. No crisis. No festival to run. Just the two of them, in their apartment, with all the time in the world.

Eben backed Noel toward the bedroom, not breaking the kiss, feeling Noel smile against his mouth when they bumped into the doorframe.

"Graceful," Noel said.

"We've got twelve days of practice. You'd think we'd be better at this by now."

"Who says we're not?"

### POV: NOEL

The laughter came first.

That's what surprised Noel—the joy of it. After weeks of tension and repair and fragile hope, there was something almost giddy about being here, in Eben's bedroom, with nothing to worry about except each other.

"Remember Day One?" Eben asked, pulling Noel's sweater over his head with careful hands.

"The tree lighting disaster?"

"The one where I thought you were the most annoying person I'd ever met."

"Charming."

"You were." Eben kissed his shoulder. "Annoyingly charming. I couldn't figure out how to handle you."

"And now?"

"Now I've given up trying to handle you." Eben's smile was soft, private. "I'm just going to love you instead."

Noel's breath caught. "That's—very romantic for someone who claims not to be romantic."

"I contain multitudes." Eben guided him toward the bed, gentle but sure. "Also, you make it easy."

They fell together onto the sheets, tangling in the way that had become familiar—learned over eleven days and one very intense night. But tonight was different. Tonight there was no desperation, no repair, no fear underneath the wanting.

Just joy.

"Remember the flour?" Noel asked, because he couldn't help it, as Eben's hands mapped paths he already knew.

"I'm still finding glitter."

"That's not flour."

"Hugh is a menace." Eben kissed him, swallowing the laughter. "But I'd do it all again. Every chaotic day. Every crisis. Every moment where I wanted to run but didn't."

"Why?"

"Because it led here." Eben's eyes were dark and serious. "To you. To us. To this."

Noel pulled him down, kissing him like the answer to a question he'd been afraid to ask.

This was their first Christmas together.

First of many.

Afterward, they lay tangled in the sheets, sweat-damp and breathless, watching the snow fall past the window.

"That was good," Noel said, his voice sleepy and satisfied.

"Just good?"

"Very good. Extremely good." Noel turned his head, pressing a kiss to Eben's shoulder. "Life-alteringly good."

"Now you're just flattering me."

"Is it working?"

Eben laughed, the sound rumbling through his chest. "Yes."

They lay in comfortable silence for a while, Noel's head on Eben's chest, Eben's fingers tracing patterns on Noel's shoulder. The apartment was quiet around them, the only sounds their breathing and the soft hiss of snow against the window.

"Hey," Noel said quietly. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For choosing me." Noel's voice was soft, vulnerable. "For staying. For being brave enough to do the thing with the gloves."

"You're thanking me for taking off my gloves."

"I'm thanking you for what it meant." Noel propped himself up on one elbow, looking down at Eben with an expression that made something tight loosen in Eben's chest. "You let people see. You let *me* see. That's... that's not nothing, Eben."

Eben was quiet for a moment, letting the truth of it settle.

"I spent my whole life keeping my walls up," he said finally. "Keeping people at a distance. Because if nobody gets close, nobody can hurt you when they leave."

"And now?"

"Now I understand that the walls weren't protecting me. They were just keeping me alone." He reached up, brushing a strand of hair from Noel's forehead. "You showed me what I was missing."

Noel's eyes were too bright. "You're going to make me cry."

"It's Christmas. Crying is allowed."

Noel laughed, leaning down to kiss him—soft and sweet and full of promise.

"This is really happening," Noel said.

"It's really happening."

"It's not temporary."

Eben's heart swelled. "No. It never was."

They fell asleep like that, wrapped around each other, warm and safe and finally, completely, home.
