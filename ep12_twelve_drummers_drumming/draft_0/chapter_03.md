# Chapter 3
## POV: Noel

The crisis hit two hours before the parade was supposed to start.

Noel was in Evergreen Square, checking the staging area for the tenth time, when his phone buzzed with a message that made his stomach drop.

*DRUM CORPS BUS BREAKDOWN. STUCK 40 MILES OUT. NO ETA.*

For a moment, he just stared at the screen, willing the words to rearrange themselves into something less catastrophic. The Twelve Drummers Drumming parade. The finale of the entire festival. The event that literally had *drums* in the name.

And the drummers weren't coming.

"What's wrong?"

Eben appeared at his elbow, reading the tension in Noel's shoulders with unnerving accuracy. Noel showed him the phone. Watched Eben's jaw tighten as he processed the information.

"Okay," Eben said, his voice calm in a way that Noel knew meant he was already running calculations. "Options."

"There are no options. The drum corps was the centerpiece. We don't have backup drums. We don't have backup *drummers*." Noel could hear his own voice rising and forced himself to breathe. "This is a disaster."

"It's a problem," Eben corrected. "Problems have solutions."

"Name one."

Eben was quiet for a moment, his eyes scanning the square. The staging area was full of parade floats and volunteers, everyone bustling with Christmas Eve energy, blissfully unaware that the whole event was about to collapse.

"The high school band," Eben said.

"What?"

"The high school band. They have a drum line. They performed at the tree lighting ceremony—Day One."

Noel's brain scrambled to catch up. Day One. The tree lighting. The local kids who'd filled in when the original performer had gotten food poisoning from questionable eggnog.

"They were good," Noel said slowly.

"They were available on short notice. They might still be." Eben was already pulling out his phone. "I have the band director's number from the backup contact list."

Of course he did. Because Eben was Eben, and Eben had contingencies for contingencies.

"Even if they agree, we'd need to rearrange the parade formation," Noel said, his mind racing through logistics. "The drum corps was supposed to lead. If it's high schoolers, they'll need—"

"Different positioning. More crowd control at the high school parents section. Adjusted sound check." Eben nodded, already texting. "We've done harder."

Noel stared at him. "We've done harder?"

"Day Five. The ice sculpture meltdown. Day Eight. The caroling chaos. Day Ten—" Eben paused, something complicated flickering across his face. "Well. Day Ten had its own problems."

They both knew what he meant. Day Ten had been the rupture. The collapse. The moment everything had broken between them.

"This is easier than Day Ten," Noel said quietly.

Eben met his eyes. "Yeah. It is."

The next hour was controlled chaos.

Eben reached the band director, who—miraculously—confirmed that most of the drum line could be mobilized within the hour. They were high schoolers who'd just been told they could be the heroes of the Christmas parade; they moved fast.

Meanwhile, Noel coordinated the parade reshuffling while simultaneously fielding panicked questions from volunteers, Mayor Kringle, and several confused float operators who couldn't understand why everything was changing.

But here was the thing: it worked.

Not perfectly. Not elegantly. But it worked.

Because Noel knew the logistics, and Eben knew the contingencies, and together they could see the whole picture—the moving pieces, the potential failures, the solutions that weren't obvious until you looked at them from two angles at once.

"Drum line confirmed," Eben said, appearing beside him with an efficiency that shouldn't have been attractive but absolutely was. "Arriving in thirty. Band director is bringing the parents, which means we've got extra volunteers."

"I moved them to front position," Noel said. "The empty space from the adult corps will be hidden by the float with the giant nutcracker."

"The nutcracker float that almost caught fire yesterday?"

"It didn't catch fire. It *smoldered*."

"Reassuring."

But Eben was smiling—a small, private thing—and Noel felt something warm bloom in his chest.

They'd done it. Again. Together.

The crowd was already gathering along Main Street, families bundled in coats and scarves, children waving homemade banners. Nobody knew how close they'd come to disaster. Nobody needed to.

Because Noel and Eben had handled it.

That was what they did now.

The high school drum line arrived with ten minutes to spare, tumbling out of cars and minivans with the chaotic energy of teenagers who'd just been told they were important. Their uniforms were slightly mismatched—some in school colors, others in hastily borrowed parade gear—but their drums gleamed, and their faces were bright with excitement.

"You saved the parade," Mayor Kringle said, appearing at Noel's elbow with the expression of a man who'd been very worried about his Christmas legacy. "You and Mr. Frost. I knew I hired the right team."

"You didn't hire us," Noel pointed out. "You voluntold us."

"Semantics." The mayor waved a hand. "The point is, you came through. Like always."

He bustled off to greet the drum line parents, and Noel turned to find Eben watching with something like amusement.

"We came through," Eben said. "Like always."

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Too late."

Noel laughed, the sound bright and free, and for a moment—standing in the chaos of the parade staging, surrounded by volunteers and drummers and the relentless Christmas cheer of Tinsel Town—he felt something he hadn't felt in twelve days of festival madness.

Peace.

Not the quiet kind. Not the still kind.

The kind that came from knowing you could handle whatever came next.

Because you weren't handling it alone.
