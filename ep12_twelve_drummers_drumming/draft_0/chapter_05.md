# Chapter 5
## POV: Eben

The public claim had been unplanned.

That's what Eben kept thinking, afterward, as the crowd dispersed and the celebration shifted from the tree to the bonfire. He hadn't walked into Evergreen Square intending to make a declaration. He hadn't rehearsed words or planned a moment. He'd just... done it.

Because it had needed to be done.

Because Noel deserved to know, and so did everyone else.

The bonfire crackled in the center of the square, flames leaping toward the darkening sky, casting everyone in warm orange light. The whole town seemed to have gathered—familiar faces and unfamiliar ones, all mixing together in the easy intimacy of shared celebration. Someone had set up a table with marshmallows and long skewers; someone else was passing around cups of something that smelled like hot cider and tasted like joy.

Eben stood at the edge of the crowd, watching Noel work the room.

Because even now, even after everything, Noel couldn't quite stop being the event director. He moved through the crowd like he belonged there—which he did—stopping to chat with volunteers, check on logistics, make sure everyone was having a good time.

But every few minutes, his eyes would find Eben's across the fire.

And every time, his smile would go softer. More private.

*Mine*, Eben thought, and the word didn't scare him anymore.

"You're staring," Wes said, appearing at his elbow with two cups of cider and the expression of a man who was deeply satisfied with the universe.

"I'm observing."

"Same thing, when you're making that face." Wes handed him a cup. "Congratulations, by the way. That was quite a moment."

"It was... unplanned."

"The best moments usually are." Wes sipped his cider, his gaze following Eben's to where Noel was now being talked at enthusiastically by Mayor Kringle. "He's happy, you know. Really happy. I haven't seen him like this in years."

Eben didn't know how to respond to that, so he just nodded.

"Don't mess it up," Wes added, but there was no heat in it. More like a formality.

"I'll try not to."

"You'll do more than try." Wes clinked his cup against Eben's. "You already have."

Sam appeared next, because apparently this was the "check on Eben" tour.

"That was good," Sam said, his voice low enough not to carry. "The thing you did. With the gloves."

"Thanks."

"I wasn't sure you had it in you. The public declaration thing." Sam shrugged, his expression thoughtful. "You've always been the 'keep it private, keep it controlled' type. I figured you'd work things out with Noel quietly, if you worked them out at all."

"So did I."

"What changed?"

Eben considered the question. What *had* changed? A week ago, the thought of standing in front of the entire town and declaring his feelings would have made him break out in hives. He'd spent his whole life avoiding exactly that kind of vulnerability, protecting himself from the exposure that came with letting people see what you wanted.

But then...

"He changed things," Eben said finally. "Noel. He made it worth being brave."

Sam nodded slowly. "That's good. That's the right answer."

"Was there a wrong answer?"

"Several." Sam's smile was small but genuine. "But you didn't give them. That's what matters."

He walked away to join Wes by the marshmallow table, and Eben was left standing by the fire, watching the flames dance, thinking about all the ways his life had changed in twelve days.

He'd come to Tinsel Town to run a festival.

He was staying for something much more important.
