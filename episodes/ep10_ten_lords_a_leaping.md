## Core Conflicts

**External problem:** Big outdoor event requires coordination; they can't avoid each other.

**Internal problem (Noel):** Operating on autopilot; pretending he's fine (his wound pattern).

**Internal problem (Eben):** Realizing he's losing Noel; too proud/scared to fix it.

**Relationship shift by end:** From "separated" to "Eben realizes he's about to lose everything"

| **Heat beat purpose** | Desire without action; tension as its own beat |
| **Key moments** | Aware of each other's bodies; memory of intimacy; almost-touch |
| **Outcome** | No resolution; ache intensifies |

**Key beats:**

- Noel was the first to go—efficient, mechanical, no goodbye
- Eben stands alone in his empty space
- For the first time, it feels wrong. Too quiet.
- Noel was here, and now Noel is gone.
- Internal: *I built this. All of this. Walls and systems and distance.*
- *And now I'm standing in the middle of it, alone.*
- *I said "this was never supposed to last" and he believed me.*
- *He believed me because I made him believe me.*
- Sam's words echo: "Destroying something before it can hurt you."
- *I have to fix this. Tomorrow. Christmas Eve.*

**Conflict:** Noel deciding whether to fight or surrender
**Exit shift:** He's close to giving up

**Key beats:**
- Home alone
- Apartment too quiet
- Internal: *Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.*
- *The festival ends the day after.*
- *And then... what?*
- He goes back to his life without Eben?
- The thought feels like a death.
- But he doesn't know how to ask someone to stay who said they never would.

**Final line hook:**
Noel stared at the empty side of his bed and thought: *Maybe temporary was always the only thing I was ever going to get.*
