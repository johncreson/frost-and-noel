## Core Conflicts

**External problem:** Animal rescue charity event at local farm; escaped animals, weather issues, chaos.

**Internal problem (Noel):** Realizing Eben is reliable in ways that scare him; wanting to ask for more.

**Internal problem (Eben):** Caretaking instinct growing; letting himself protect Noel openly.

**Relationship shift by end:** From "fake dating/denial" to "Noel asks for something real"

## Dialogue Must-Hit Lines

| Character | Line |
|-----------|------|
| **Noel** | "I want this to be real." |
| **Eben** | "I'm not going to guess." / "It's real." |
| **Subtext line** | Hand on hand during the drive (no words needed) |

## Cozy Texture Checklist

- [x] Smell: Hay, animals, cold air, Eben's scarf
- [x] Tactile: Scarf wrapped around Noel, hand on hand, barn warmth
- [x] Light: Golden hour, barn lighting, car dashboard
- [x] Food: Kids' snacks at event; they grab something quick

## Continuity Flags

- [ ] Noel asks for something real = major relationship shift
- [ ] Eben's scarf = callback potential
- [ ] "I'm not going to guess" = consent pattern established
- [ ] Farm setting = potential callback (EP12?)
- [ ] First time Noel accepts care without fighting
- [ ] The ask = "it's real" → but can they sustain it?
