## Dialogue Must-Hit Lines

| Character | Line |
|-----------|------|
| **Noel** | "Unless you don't want it to be fake." |
| **Eben** | "Good." (praise moment) |
| **Subtext line** | "Fake dating." (both knowing it's not) |

---

## Cozy Texture Checklist

- [x] Smell: Expensive sponsor perfume, evening cold, coffee
- [x] Tactile: Hand-holding (public), Eben's hand on Noel's jaw (private)
- [x] Light: Reception lights, photo flashes, evening snow
- [x] Food: Reception food (fancy), neither eats much

---

## Continuity Flags

- [ ] Fake dating = town assumes they're together now
- [ ] Jealousy surfaces → Eben's feelings undeniable
- [ ] Signature dynamic (praise/control) introduced
- [ ] Sponsor photos = evidence that will matter later
- [ ] "Good" becomes loaded word
- [ ] "Temporary" becoming less believable
