## Cozy Texture Checklist

- [x] Tactile: Holding, forehead touch, hands on face
- [x] Light: Winter afternoon → night → apartment warmth
- [x] Food: Someone made them eat at some point

- [ ] "I'm choosing you" = Eben's character arc complete
- [ ] "That okay counts" = callback to Wes/Sam novella
- [ ] Repair sex = full of words, unlike the rupture's silence
- [ ] "I stay" = answers the EP8 question
- [ ] Tomorrow = Christmas finale
