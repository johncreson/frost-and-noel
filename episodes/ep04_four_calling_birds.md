## Core Conflicts

**External problem:** The caroling night's sound system fails mid-event; Eben fixes while Noel manages crowd.

**Internal problem (Noel):** Wants to define what they are; afraid of rejection.

**Internal problem (Eben):** Feeling too much; draws a boundary that hurts them both.

**Relationship shift by end:** From "had sex, feeling close" to "boundary drawn, distance created"

## Cozy Texture Checklist

- [x] Smell: Cold evening air, mulled cider from vendors
- [x] Tactile: Cold hands, warm crowd, equipment cables
- [x] Light: Fairy lights, stage lights, evening darkness
- [x] Food: Cider, cookies from Wes's booth (neither eats much)

- [ ] Sponsor arrives EP5 = external pressure incoming
- [ ] They work as a team even when personal is broken
