## Core Conflicts

**External problem:** Main holiday market structure collapses before opening; overnight rebuild required.

**Internal problem (Noel):** Wants permanence; afraid to ask for it.

**Internal problem (Eben):** Feeling domestic; panics at what that means.

**Relationship shift by end:** From "dating" to "commitment-coded intimacy"—the scene reads like commitment before it's spoken
