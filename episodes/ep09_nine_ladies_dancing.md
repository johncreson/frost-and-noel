- But Noel's face. That blank "okay."
- *I just lost him.*
- *And I did it on purpose.*

**Final line hook:**

## Cozy Texture Checklist

- [x] Smell: Morning coffee, cold hall, nothing comforting
- [x] Tactile: Distance where there was touch
- [x] Light: Morning warmth → harsh event lights → empty darkness
- [x] Food: Skipped meals (neither can eat)

---

## Continuity Flags

- [ ] "This was never supposed to last" = the wound that must be healed
- [ ] Noel's blank "okay" = callback to how he shuts down
- [ ] Public exposure = town witnessed something
- [ ] No heat = deliberate absence; the rupture is the scene
- [ ] Eben's pattern named: destroy before destroyed
- [ ] This is the darkest moment of the season
