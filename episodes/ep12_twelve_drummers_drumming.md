| Character | Line |
|-----------|------|

## Cozy Texture Checklist

- [x] Smell: Bonfire, pine, coffee, their apartment
- [x] Tactile: Hand-holding public, tangled in bed, warm mugs
- [x] Light: Christmas lights, bonfire glow, morning sun
- [x] Food: Bonfire marshmallows, coffee in morning

## Continuity Flags

- [ ] "This isn't temporary" → pays off EP1's lie
- [ ] "Move in with me" → domestic HEA confirmed
- [ ] "It never was" → the arc complete
- [ ] Public claim → answers EP4's "between us" boundary
- [ ] Full ensemble appearance → found family payoff
- [ ] Epilogue morning → mirrors EP8's morning after, now permanent
- [ ] Christmas → the Twelve Days complete the promise

## Series Wrap

The Twelve Days of Christmas is complete.

Noel Merrick learned he doesn't have to earn love.
Eben Frost learned that attachment doesn't have to mean loss.

They saved the festival.
They saved each other.

And on Boxing Day morning, over coffee, they started planning next year's Twelve Days—together.

**HEA: CONFIRMED**
