## Core Conflicts

**External problem:** The main planning room is double-booked with Hugh's craft committee; Noel and Eben are forced into a tiny office.

**Internal problem (Noel):** Pretending EP1 didn't affect him; pretending he doesn't want Eben's steadiness.

**Internal problem (Eben):** First slip of vulnerability; realizes he's watching Noel too closely.

**Relationship shift by end:** From "reluctant collaborators with spark" to "people who have kissed and are pretending they haven't"

## Scene List (8 Scenes)

### Scene 1: Morning Friction (Noel POV)
**Location:** Merryweather Hall, 6 AM
**Goal:** Show Noel pretending yesterday didn't matter
**Conflict:** Eben is already there when Noel arrives
**Exit shift:** Noel irritated by how much he noticed

**Key beats:**
- Noel arrives, expecting to be first
- Eben is already working, coffee made, schedule updated
- "You're early." "I'm on time. You're late."
- Noel sat up all night thinking about Eben. He will die before admitting it.
- Internal: *He made coffee. That doesn't mean anything.*

---

### Scene 2: The Room Problem (Dual)
**Location:** Merryweather Hall → Everhart Crafts → tiny office
**Goal:** Force proximity via double-booking + comic craft store visit
**Conflict:** Hugh's craft committee has taken the main room
**Exit shift:** Stuck together in a tiny office after glitter ambush

**Key beats:**
- Hugh: "Sorry, we booked three months ago! Glitter emergency!"
- Hugh insists they need supplies: "Come grab ribbon while you're here. I won't take no."
- Quick detour to Everhart Crafts (first visit to this location)
- The store is chaos incarnate: glitter on every surface, hot glue smell, holiday music
- Hugh hands them a craft project: "Make yourselves useful while you wait."
- Eben looks physically pained. Noel is trying not to laugh.
- They end up covered in glitter specs (callbacks later)
- Escape to the tiny backup office
- One desk. Two chairs. Very close.
- Eben: "This is inefficient." Noel: "This is my life."
- They set up anyway, knees almost touching, glitter still visible

---

### Scene 3: Competence Tension (Eben POV)
**Location:** Tiny office
**Goal:** Show Eben watching Noel too closely
**Conflict:** Eben keeps noticing details he shouldn't
**Exit shift:** Eben's internal walls start cracking

**Key beats:**
- Noel works, oblivious to being studied
- Eben notices: the way Noel bites his lip, the tired lines, the way he laughs at nothing
- Internal: *Stop. This is not your concern.*
- Noel catches him looking. Eben doesn't look away fast enough.
- Noel: "What?" Eben: "...nothing."
- *Something shifts.*

---

### Scene 4: The Town Interrupts (Noel POV)
**Location:** Garland Cup (coffee run)
**Goal:** External perspective on their dynamic
**Conflict:** Everyone sees what they're pretending isn't there
**Exit shift:** Noel realizes others are watching them

**Key beats:**
- Coffee run together (practical excuse to escape the tiny room)
- Wes: "You two look cozy." Noel: "We're working."
- Barista gives them a knowing look
- Eben orders for Noel without asking—correctly
- Noel: "How did you know my order?"
- Eben: "You mentioned it yesterday." (He didn't.)
- Internal: *He paid attention. Why does that matter?*

---

### Scene 5: Late Night Work (Noel POV)
**Location:** Tiny office, evening
**Goal:** Build tension through exhaustion and proximity
**Conflict:** They should go home. Neither is leaving.
**Exit shift:** Something has to break

**Key beats:**
- Hours pass; the hall empties
- They're alone in the tiny office, too tired to fight
- Noel yawns; Eben glances up
- "Go home." "You're still here." "That's different."
- Noel: "How is that different?"
- Eben doesn't answer. *Because I want to stay where you are.*

---

### Scene 6: Vulnerability Slip (Eben POV)
**Location:** Tiny office, late night
**Goal:** Eben's first real vulnerability
**Conflict:** Noel asks a question Eben can't deflect
**Exit shift:** Eben admits something true

**Key beats:**
- Quiet settles. The pretense thins.
- Noel: "Why did you take this job?"
- Eben should lie. Should say "the mayor asked."
- Instead: "I don't know."
- The honesty surprises both of them.
- Noel goes still. "That's… not an answer."
- Eben: "It's the truth."
- *The room feels smaller.*

---

### Scene 7: The Kiss (Dual)
**Location:** Tiny office, late night
**Goal:** FIRST KISS
**Conflict:** Neither should want this. Both do.
**Exit shift:** Everything has changed

**Key beats:**
- One of them reaches for papers. Hands brush.
- Neither pulls away.
- Eben: "Noel." (first name use—intimate)
- Noel's breath catches.
- Pause. Eye contact. Silent question.
- Noel doesn't answer with words. He leans in.
- The kiss is soft. Then less soft.
- Eben's hand on Noel's jaw. Noel grabbing Eben's collar.
- When they pull apart: stunned silence.

**Consent beat:**
- The pause before the kiss
- Eye contact = asking
- Noel initiating = answering

---

### Scene 8: Hook Ending (Noel POV)
**Location:** Tiny office → parking lot
**Goal:** Establish denial; set up EP3
**Conflict:** What do they do with what just happened?
**Exit shift:** Pretend it didn't happen (lie)

**Key beats:**
- They separate. Stare at each other.
- Eben: "We should—"
- Noel: "Yeah."
- They pack up in loaded silence.
- Walking out together, not touching.
- Noel: "So. See you tomorrow."
- Eben: "Six AM."
- Neither mentions the kiss.
- Noel gets in his car. Sits there. Breathes.
- Internal: *What did I just do?*

**Final line hook:**
Noel sat in his car until Eben's taillights disappeared, and thought about nothing but that kiss for the rest of the night.

## Dialogue Must-Hit Lines

| Character | Line |
|-----------|------|
| **Noel** | "Why did you take this job?" |
| **Eben** | "I don't know." (first honesty) |
| **Subtext line** | "Noel." (first name use before kiss) |

---

## Cozy Texture Checklist

- [x] Smell: Coffee, old books from the office, Eben's winter scent
- [x] Tactile: Close quarters, knees brushing, cold hands
- [x] Light: Harsh office lights → dimmed evening → parking lot darkness
- [x] Food: Garland Cup coffee, skipped dinner

---

## Continuity Flags

- [ ] Eben uses "Noel" for the first time (significant)
- [ ] First kiss happens organically from tension, not accident
- [ ] Neither discusses it afterward = tension for EP3
- [ ] Hugh's craft committee = recurring comic obstacle
- [ ] Eben knowing Noel's coffee order = attentiveness detail
