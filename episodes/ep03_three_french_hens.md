## Core Conflicts

**External problem:** Bake-off fundraiser for the festival; judge drama; flour disaster.

**Internal problem (Noel):** Pretending the kiss didn't happen while thinking about nothing else.

**Internal problem (Eben):** Seeing Noel be kind to everyone triggers something; fights wanting more.

**Relationship shift by end:** From "pretending kiss didn't happen" to "they've slept together and can't pretend anymore"

**Exit shift:** In close quarters again, pretending harder

**Key beats:**
- Wes hosts the bake-off; Noel coordinates, Eben handles logistics
- Eben watches Noel work the crowd—smiling, laughing, touching arms

**Key beats:**
- Noel goes to the back for supplies
- Finds Eben helping a nervous first-time baker who's crying
- Eben is gentle. Patient. Not dismissive.
- The baker hugs him. Eben freezes, then pats her back awkwardly.
- Noel watches. Heart doing something inconvenient.

### Scene 5: The Win (Dual)
**Location:** Bakery, event conclusion

**Conflict:** They should celebrate separately. They don't.
**Exit shift:** The excuse to be together

- Noel: "Good work today."
- Eben: "You handled the judge meltdown well."

### Scene 6: The Walk (Noel POV)
**Location:** Streets between bakery and Merryweather Hall
**Goal:** Build to the inevitable; they're going to kiss again
**Conflict:** Both want it; neither is saying it
**Exit shift:** They end up at Noel's office

**Key beats:**
- Walking in cold evening air, flour still in their hair
- Snow falling. Town lights. Quiet.
- Shoulders brushing. Neither moving away.
- Noel: "About the other night—"
- Eben: "We don't have to—"
- Noel: "I want to."
- Eben stops walking. *Looks at him.*

### Scene 7: The First Time (Both POV - alternate)
**Location:** Noel's office at Merryweather Hall (door locked)
**Goal:** FIRST FULL SEX SCENE
**Conflict:** Vulnerability; wanting more than just physical
**Exit shift:** Everything has changed. Again.

**Key beats:**
- They barely make it inside before kissing
- This kiss is not soft. It's hungry.
- Eben takes control physically; Noel lets him
- Consent explicit: "Do you want this?" "Yes."
- Eben guides; Noel surrenders
- "Look at me" moment at peak
- Tender, not rough; emotional, not just physical
- Noel's internal: *Nobody has touched me like this matters.*
- Eben's internal: *I'm in trouble.*

**Heat beats:**
1. Desperate kissing
2. Clothes loosened, not fully removed (first time = imperfect)
3. Hands on skin
4. Eben's control + Noel's release
5. Eye contact throughout
6. Completion with vulnerability

**Consent moments:**
- "Do you want this?"
- "Tell me if you want me to stop."
- "Yes. Please."

### Scene 8: Afterglow + Hook (Eben POV)
**Location:** Noel's office, after
**Goal:** Aftercare + set up EP4 tension
**Conflict:** What does this mean? Neither can answer.
**Exit shift:** "We should talk about this." "Tomorrow."

**Key beats:**
- Eben cleans them up (damp cloth, practical care)
- Drapes Noel's coat over his shoulders
- Noel looks up at him, stunned and soft
- Eben: "Are you okay?"
- Noel: "I don't know."
- They don't define it. Neither is ready.
- Noel: "Tomorrow. We'll figure it out."
- Eben: "Okay."
- He doesn't want to leave. He leaves anyway.

**Final line hook:**
Eben walked home in the snow, flour still in his collar, and realized he hadn't thought about control in hours.

## Dialogue Must-Hit Lines

| Character | Line |
|-----------|------|
| **Noel** | "I want to." (about addressing the kiss) |
| **Eben** | "Look at me." (during intimacy) |
| **Subtext line** | "Are you okay?" / "I don't know." |

## Cozy Texture Checklist

- [x] Smell: Baking, sugar, flour, Eben's coat
- [x] Tactile: Flour on skin, cold walk, warm office, hands
- [x] Light: Bakery warmth → evening snow → dim office
- [x] Food: Bake-off treats throughout; neither really eats (too nervous)

---

## Continuity Flags

- [ ] First sex scene = tender, consent-forward, emotionally revelatory
- [ ] Eben's kindness to the baker = character depth
- [ ] Noel can't stop thinking about it = hook for EP4
- [ ] No "I love you" yet—too early
- [ ] Office = callback location (can return)
- [ ] Flour motif = carried through
