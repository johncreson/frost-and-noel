## Core Conflicts

**External problem:** Festival kickoff permits weren't filed correctly; half the vendors can't set up; volunteers are MIA.

**Internal problem (Noel):** Proving he can handle this alone because being useful = being lovable.

**Internal problem (Eben):** Hired against his will to work with someone who represents everything he avoids—warmth, chaos, attachment.

**Relationship shift by end:** From "absolute strangers with friction" to "reluctant collaborators with spark"

## Scene List (8 Scenes)

### Scene 1: Cold Open - The Clipboard Crisis (Noel POV)
**Location:** Merryweather Hall, 6 AM
**Goal:** Establish Noel's competence AND his "useful = lovable" wound
**Conflict:** Three crises hit simultaneously (permit, vendor, volunteer)
**Exit shift:** Noel realizes he's drowning but refuses to ask for help

**Key beats:**
- Noel alone in the dark hall, already working
- Phone buzzes with bad news (permits)
- Mayor Kringle calls with "reassurance" that sounds like pressure
- Noel's internal: "This is fine. I'm fine. I've got this."

---

### Scene 2: The Frost Descends (Dual POV - switch to Eben)
**Location:** Merryweather Hall entrance, 7 AM
**Goal:** First meeting with immediate friction
**Conflict:** Eben arrives as "hired help" Noel didn't know was coming
**Exit shift:** Mutual irritation masking mutual assessment

**Key beats:**
- Eben enters like winter itself—cold, precise, judging
- Noel's bristle: "We're closed."
- Eben's evaluation: clocking Noel's exhaustion, the chaos, the pretense
- "Mayor Kringle hired me." "Of course he did."
- The glove removal beat—Eben's deliberate, controlled movements
- First spark: Noel's pulse jumps at being *seen*

**Dialogue must-hit:**
- Eben: "Do you need help?"
- Noel: "I'm handling it."
- Eben: "That's one word for it."

---

### Scene 3: Competence Clash (Noel POV)
**Location:** Merryweather Hall, main floor

- Noel watches, annoyed that it worked
- Eben reorganizes the volunteer sign-in without asking
- Noel: "You can't just—" Eben: "I already did."

### Scene 4: The Town Watches (Noel POV)

---

### Scene 6: Working Together (Dual)
**Location:** Merryweather Hall + Evergreen Square, afternoon
**Goal:** Show them as a team for the first time
**Conflict:** External pressure forces cooperation
**Exit shift:** Rhythm established; danger of working well together

**Key beats:**
- Montage-style: solving problems together
- Noel handles people; Eben handles logistics
- They develop shorthand without meaning to
- A volunteer: "You two have been working together long?"
- Noel: "...no." (realizing how in-sync they've become)
- Micro-intimacy: Eben hands Noel coffee without being asked

---

### Scene 7: The Evening Save (Noel POV)
**Location:** Evergreen Square, dusk
**Goal:** Festival kickoff actually happens; team victory
**Conflict:** Final crisis (weather? vendor? mayor speech disaster?)
**Exit shift:** Relief; exhaustion; awareness of each other

**Key beats:**
- Lights go on; crowd cheers; the day is saved
- Noel stands at the edge, watching it work
- Eben appears beside him, quiet
- First time they're just standing together, not solving something
- Noel: "Thank you." (genuine)
- Eben: silence, then a nod
- Their arms brush. Neither moves away.

---

### Scene 8: Hook Ending (Eben POV)
**Location:** Merryweather Hall, late night
**Goal:** Establish "temporary" lie; set up next episode
**Conflict:** What are they now?
**Exit shift:** Agreement to continue working together; denial of what that means

**Key beats:**
- Cleanup is done; they're alone
- Eben should leave. He's not leaving.
- Noel: "So. Tomorrow."
- Eben: "I'll be here at six."
- Noel: "That's insane." Eben: "That's your start time."
- Noel laughs, surprised
- Eben's internal: *Don't. Don't like the way he laughs.*
- Noel: "This is temporary. Just for the festival."
- Eben: "Temporary."
- *They don't look at each other when they say it.*

**Final line hook:**
"Temporary," Eben repeated, like it was a promise he wasn't sure he could keep.

## Dialogue Must-Hit Lines

| Character | Line |
|-----------|------|
| **Noel** | "I don't need rescuing." |
| **Eben** | "I'm not rescuing. I'm optimizing." |
| **Subtext line** | "Temporary." (both lying) |

## Cozy Texture Checklist

- [x] Smell: Cold pine, coffee, Noel's stress-sweat masked by cinnamon
- [x] Tactile: Eben's gloves, the cold air, Noel's chapped hands
- [x] Light: Morning dark → evening twinkle lights
- [x] Food: Wes's pastries, coffee throughout, skipped lunch

---

## Continuity Flags

- [ ] Show Eben's control patterns (gloves, timing, deliberate movements)
- [ ] Introduce town geography (Hall, Square, Bakery, Cup mentions)
- [ ] Mayor Kringle as well-meaning pressure source
- [ ] First "Temporary" promise (will pay off at EP12)
- [ ] No kiss, no explicit touching beyond accidental
