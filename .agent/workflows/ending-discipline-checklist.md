# Episode Ending Discipline Checklist

## 1. One Realization Per Scene
Each scene gets **one** emotional realization. Not one per POV. Not one per paragraph.
If you hear yourself saying the same truth twice with different phrasing, cut the second.

## 2. Don't Translate the Moment
If the reader can infer it from body language, silence, interruption, or restraint — **do not narrate it**.

## 3. Watch for the "Author Lean-In"
When prose gets lyrical, declarative, and certain — that's usually where you stop.
If a paragraph feels like "I should really make sure they understand—" → delete it.

## 4. End Scenes on Friction, Not Explanation
**Good endings:** unanswered question, interrupted desire, physical separation, withheld words
**Bad endings:** emotional summary, thematic thesis, mutual clarity

## 5. If You Have Three Good Endings, Pick the Meanest
You consistently write a strong ending, a stronger ending, then a "just to be safe" ending.
That last one is fear talking. Cut it.

## 6. Eben-Specific Rule
Eben should **never fully articulate** why he stays, why Noel matters, why leaving hurts.
If he ever does, it should cost him something immediately.
If he's thinking it comfortably, you've gone too far.

## 7. Noel-Specific Rule  
Noel can name the wound (*wanted vs useful*), but:
- not resolve it
- not heal it
- not feel secure about it

Hope is fine. Safety is not. Not yet.

## 8. Episode End Test
> "Did something *change*, or did something *get clearer*?"

You want **change**, not clarity.
If it's clarity, you wrote one paragraph too many.
