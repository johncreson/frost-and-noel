## Chapter 07: Commitment Sex

They kissed.

Slow. Deliberate. Different from every other time.

This wasn't desperate. Wasn't frantic. Wasn't driven by temporary want or holiday magic or the excuse of "just for now."

This was *permanent*.

This was "I'm staying."

This was everything.

Noel's hands found Eben's shoulders. Pulled him closer. Eben came willingly, settling between Noel's knees, hands framing his face like he was something precious. Like he was worth holding carefully.

"I've got you," Eben murmured against his mouth.

"I know," Noel breathed back.

And he did. He knew.

Eben had been showing him for days. In a hundred small ways. The coat offered without being asked. The coffee handed over at exactly the right moment. The way he stood beside Noel instead of in front of him.

The way he *stayed*.

They moved together. Slowly. Carefully. Like they had all the time in the world.

Because they did.

They had time now. They had permanence. They had *staying*.

No more counting down days. No more "just until Christmas." No more pretending this was temporary when it had stopped being temporary somewhere around Day 3.

Eben's hands slid under Noel's shirt. Warm. Steady. Grounding.

Noel shivered. Not from cold. From want. From the overwhelming reality that this was happening. That Eben was here. That he'd promised to stay.

"Is this okay?" Eben asked, fingers pausing at the hem.

"Yes."

"You'll tell me if—"

"I will." Noel kissed him again. Deeper. "I promise. But I'm okay. I'm—more than okay."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They undressed slowly. Piece by piece. No rush. No urgency.

Just—presence. Attention. Care.

Noel's shirt. Eben's sweater. Jeans discarded. Socks kicked off somewhere near the nightstand.

Every piece of clothing removed felt like a layer of protection shed. A wall coming down. A choice to be vulnerable.

To be seen.

To be wanted, exactly as they were.

Eben's fingers traced the bandage on Noel's wrist. Then the ribbon, still tied there, bright red against his skin.

"You kept it," he said softly.

"Of course I did."

"It's just ribbon."

"No," Noel said. "It's not."

Their eyes met.

And Eben understood.

It wasn't just ribbon. It was a symbol. A reminder. A promise made physical.

The ribbon from Day 1, when this had all started. When Eben had tied the first gift and looked at Noel like he was a problem to be solved.

Now he looked at Noel like he was the answer.

"I'm not going anywhere," Eben said again.

"I know."

"I need you to know. I need—" Eben's voice caught. "I need you to believe me."

"I do," Noel said. "I believe you."

Eben kissed him. Deeper this time. More certain. Like he was trying to prove it with his mouth, his hands, his whole body.

*I'm staying. I'm here. I'm yours.*

They moved to the bed properly. Lay down together. Skin against skin. Heart against heart.

The sheets were cool. Eben's body was warm. Noel pressed closer, needing the contact, needing the proof that this was real.

"I want you," Noel said.

"You have me."

"For real?"

"For real."

Noel's throat tightened. "Say it again."

"You have me," Eben repeated. "All of me. For as long as you want me."

"Forever, then."

Eben's breath caught. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

"Okay," Eben said softly. "Forever."

---

They took their time.

Touching. Tasting. Learning each other like this was the first time, even though it wasn't.

But it felt like the first time.

Because this time, it meant something different.

This time, it meant *staying*.

Eben's mouth traced a path down Noel's throat. Across his collarbone. Down his chest. Every touch deliberate. Intentional. Like he was memorizing Noel's body. Like he had all the time in the world to learn it.

Because he did.

They had time now.

They had forever.

"Eben," Noel breathed.

"I'm here."

"I know. I just—I wanted to say your name."

Eben lifted his head. Met Noel's eyes. "Say it again."

"Eben."

"Again."

"Eben."

The name settled between them. Intimate. Real. Theirs.

Not "Frost." Not the surname he used as armor. Just—Eben. The person beneath the walls. The man who'd promised to stay.

They moved together. Slow and deliberate. Eyes open. Watching each other.

Noel had never been good at eye contact during sex. It felt too vulnerable. Too exposing. Too much like letting someone see all the parts of him he usually kept hidden.

But with Eben, he couldn't look away.

Didn't want to look away.

Wanted to see everything. Wanted to be seen.

"Is this okay?" Eben asked, voice rough.

"Yes."

"You're sure?"

"I'm sure. Are you?"

"Yeah." Eben's hands tightened on Noel's hips. "I'm sure."

They found their rhythm. Easy. Natural. Like they'd been doing this forever.

Like they'd do it forever.

The thought should terrify Noel. He'd spent his whole life avoiding forever. Avoiding permanence. Avoiding the kind of attachment that could break him when it inevitably ended.

But this didn't feel like it would end.

This felt like it was just beginning.

"I've got you," Eben murmured.

"I know."

"I'm not going anywhere."

"I know."

"I mean it."

"I know," Noel said. "I believe you."

And he did.

He believed it with everything he had.

---

After—when they were tangled together, breathless and sated and whole—Eben pressed his face into Noel's shoulder and said, "I love you."

The words were quiet. Almost inaudible.

But Noel heard them.

His heart stopped. Restarted. Stuttered.

"What?" he whispered.

Eben lifted his head. Met his eyes.

And Noel saw it there. The fear. The vulnerability. The terrifying honesty of someone who'd just handed over their heart and was waiting to see if it would be kept safe.

"I love you," Eben said again. Clearer this time. Certain. "I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to be good at this. But I love you. And I'm staying."

Noel's eyes stung. His throat closed. His chest felt too full, like his heart was trying to expand beyond the space his ribs allowed.

"Eben—"

"You don't have to say it back. I just needed you to know."

"I love you too," Noel said. "I love you too."

Eben's breath shuddered out. Relief. Joy. Something that looked dangerously close to tears.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." Noel cupped his face. "I love you. I'm pretty sure I've loved you since you fixed my spreadsheet on Day 2 and didn't make me feel stupid about it."

Eben laughed. Soft. Surprised. "That's when you knew?"

"That's when I started suspecting. I knew for sure when you stayed with me at the ice rink. When you didn't leave even though I told you to."

"I couldn't leave."

"I know."

They kissed. Soft. Sweet. Perfect.

"I'm staying," Eben said again.

"I know."

"For real."

"I know."

"I promise."

"I know," Noel said. "I believe you."

And he did.

He believed it with everything he had.

---

They fell asleep like that.

Tangled together. Holding each other. Safe.

For the first time in either of their lives, they fell asleep believing that this—this closeness, this connection, this *love*—could last.

That it would last.

That they would make it last.

Together.

Noel's last thought before sleep claimed him was: *This is what staying feels like.*

And it felt perfect.

It felt like home.

It felt like forever.

And for the first time in his life, forever didn't scare him.

It felt exactly right.
