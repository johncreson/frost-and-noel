## Chapter 03: The Overnight

Night fell.

Most people went home. Exhausted. Satisfied. Promising to return in the morning for the final touches.

Noel and Eben stayed.

So did a handful of others—the core crew. Wes. Hugh. Sam. A few vendors who wanted to see their booths finished.

But mostly, it was Noel and Eben.

The market was nearly done. Just final touches. Lights that needed adjusting. Decorations that needed hanging. The kind of detail work that required patience and precision and too much caffeine.

Noel was running on fumes.

He'd been awake since five. Had been moving non-stop since seven. His hands ached. His back hurt. His wrist—still bandaged from the ice rink incident—was throbbing.

But they were so close.

"Here," Eben said, handing him a fresh coffee.

Noel took it gratefully. Their fingers brushed. Lingered.

"Thanks."

"You should rest."

"So should you."

"I will. When you do."

Noel smiled. "Stubborn."

"Says the man who's been organizing a disaster recovery for twelve hours straight."

"Fair point."

They stood there for a moment, drinking coffee in the cold, watching the lights twinkle across the nearly-finished market.

"It's beautiful," Noel said quietly.

"It is."

"We did this."

"We did."

Simple. Present tense. Together.

Noel set down his coffee and went back to work.

At midnight, Noel found a spool of red ribbon.

It was from one of the collapsed stalls—a craft vendor who'd been selling handmade ornaments. The ribbon had survived the destruction, still wound neatly on its spool, bright red against the snow.

Noel picked it up. Wound a piece around his wrist absently, thinking about placement for the final decorations.

"Here," Eben said, appearing beside him. "Let me."

He took the ribbon. Carefully unwound the piece Noel had wrapped haphazardly around his wrist.

Then he tied it properly.

Careful. Deliberate. Like it mattered.

His fingers were gentle. Precise. The ribbon settled against Noel's skin, just above the bandage, a bright splash of color in the dim light.

"There," Eben said softly.

Noel looked down at the ribbon. Then up at Eben.

Their eyes met.

The ribbon from Day 1. The one Eben had used to tie the first gift. Now it was on Noel's wrist, tied by Eben's hands, and it meant something different.

Something more.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly.

Eben's thumb brushed across the ribbon. Across Noel's wrist. Just once. Then he stepped back.

"Come on," he said. "Still have lights to hang."

They went back to work.

But Noel kept touching the ribbon. Feeling it against his skin. A physical reminder that Eben was here. That they were doing this together.

That maybe—just maybe—this was real.

---

They worked in comfortable silence.

Installing lights. Hanging decorations. Building something together.

The others had gone home. It was just them now. Alone in the square, surrounded by half-finished beauty and the quiet hum of night.

"We're actually going to make it," Noel said.

"We are."

Noel glanced at him. Eben was focused on a string of lights, expression serious, hands steady.

"I couldn't have done this without you," Noel said.

Eben looked up. "Yes, you could have."

"Maybe. But I wouldn't have wanted to."

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. Something warm and complicated and a little bit scared.

"Noel—"

"I know," Noel said. "I know we said temporary. I know we said just for the holidays. But—"

"We should finish this," Eben said quietly. "Then we can talk."

Noel's heart stuttered. "Okay."

They went back to work.

But the air between them had changed.

Charged. Electric. Full of things unsaid.

---

At 3 AM, Noel fell asleep.

He didn't mean to. One minute he was sitting on a stack of tarps, taking a break, wrapped in Eben's coat because Eben had insisted. The next minute, he was gone.

Exhaustion hit like a wave.

He dreamed of lights and ribbon and Eben's hands, careful and sure.

When he woke—minutes or hours later, he couldn't tell—the first thing he saw was Eben.

Sitting beside him. Watching him sleep.

"Hey," Noel said, voice rough.

"Hey."

"Did I—how long was I out?"

"Twenty minutes. Maybe thirty."

"Sorry."

"Don't be." Eben's voice was soft. "You needed it."

Noel sat up slowly. The ribbon was still on his wrist. Eben's coat was still around his shoulders.

"You should sleep too," Noel said.

"I will."

"When?"

"When you do."

Noel smiled. "We're going in circles."

"Yeah."

They sat there, side by side, wrapped in exhaustion and cold and something that felt dangerously close to contentment.

"The market's done," Eben said quietly.

Noel looked around. He was right. The lights were up. The decorations were hung. Everything was in place.

"We did it," Noel said.

"We did."

"Together."

"Yeah," Eben said. "Together."

Dawn was starting to break. Pink and gold light creeping across the sky, illuminating the market they'd rebuilt from nothing.

It was beautiful.

They'd done this. Together. Built something from nothing overnight.

"We should rest," Noel said.

"Yeah," Eben agreed.

Neither moved.

They sat there, watching the sun rise over the market, and Noel thought: *This is what partnership looks like.*

Not just the work.

The sitting. The silence. The being together without needing to fill the space.

"Come on," Eben said finally. "Let's go home."

Home.

Noel's apartment.

Their space.

"Yeah," Noel said. "Let's go home."

They stood. Walked back together, exhausted and triumphant.

And Noel knew—absolutely knew—that when they got there, everything was going to change.
