## Chapter 03: The Ask

Back at Noel's apartment, they were too tired to pretend distance.

Noel started coffee. Eben sat on the couch.

Domestic. Natural. Real.

"You should sleep," Noel said.

"You should too."

Noel sat beside him. Close. Deliberate.

"I want you to stay."

Eben's breath caught. "I am staying."

"Not just tonight." Noel's voice was quiet. Certain. "I want you to stay. For real."

The silence stretched. Long enough to hurt.

Then Eben: "I'm not going anywhere."

Five words. Everything.

Noel kissed him.

It was different this time. Not desperate. Not uncertain. Deliberate.

"I want you to stay" echoed through everything.

They moved to the bedroom. Slow. Intentional.

This wasn't just physical anymore. Maybe it never had been.

Eben's hand on his face, thumb tracing his cheekbone. "I'm not going anywhere." Repeated. Confirmed. Made real.

Afterward, they actually slept. In bed. Holding.

First time = real rest together.

This was what staying felt like.

Morning came.

Eben woke first. Got up. Started coffee.

Realized: *I know where everything is.*

*I fit here.*

The thought should comfort him. It terrified him instead.

This was everything he'd spent his life avoiding. Attachment. Belonging. The kind of happiness that had teeth, that could bite back if you weren't careful.

Noel woke. Saw him. Smiled.

"You stayed."

"Yeah."

*But internally: How long before I ruin this?*

Eben handed Noel coffee and thought: *This is everything I've ever wanted. And that's exactly why I'm afraid.*

Three days left.

Everything was about to change.
