## Chapter 01: The Collapse

The holiday market collapsed. The actual, physical holiday market. Because the universe had a sense of comedic timing that Noel did not appreciate.

He stood in front of the wreckage and thought: *Of course.*

The main tent was down. Booths crushed. Decorations scattered across the square like confetti after a very sad party.

"How bad is it?" Eben appeared at his side.

"Bad."

"Scale of one to ten?"

"Eleven."

Mayor Kringle was having what could only be described as a breakdown. Several vendors were crying. Hugh was covered in what looked like tinsel and regret.

A month ago, Noel would have tried to rebuild the entire thing by himself using spite and caffeine. That had been his pattern. Fix it. Don't ask. Be useful.

But he'd learned something in the past week.

"I need everyone," Noel said.

Eben looked at him. "What?"

"I need everyone. The whole town. We can't do this alone."

Eben's expression shifted. Softened. "Okay. What do you need?"

He asked. Didn't take over. Just—asked.

"Call everyone. Tell them we're rebuilding. Today."

"Done."

Eben pulled out his phone. Started making calls.

Noel turned to the Mayor. "We're fixing this."

"How?"

"Together."

Within an hour, the town had mobilized.

Wes brought food. Hugh brought tarps. Sam brought tools. People Noel had never met showed up with supplies and determination.

Found family. Assembled.

Noel organized. Eben built. They worked in sync like they'd been doing this for years.

Someone said, "You two are impressive."

They exchanged a look. *Yeah. We are.*

The work continued. The market started to take shape again.

And Noel thought: *This is what asking for help looks like.*

It felt good.
