## Chapter 02: The Ribbon

Night fell. Most people went home. Noel and Eben stayed.

The market was nearly done. Just final touches. Lights. Decorations.

Noel found a spool of red ribbon from a collapsed stall. Wound a piece around his wrist absently, thinking.

Eben noticed. He always noticed.

"Here," Eben said, taking the ribbon. "Let me."

He tied it properly. Careful. Deliberate. Like it mattered.

"There," Eben said softly.

The ribbon from Day 1. Now it meant something different.

They worked in comfortable silence. Installing lights. Hanging decorations. Building something together.

"We're actually going to make it," Noel said.

"We are."

Simple. Present tense. Together.

At 3 AM, Noel fell asleep on a stack of tarps, wrapped in Eben's coat.

Eben watched him sleep and thought: *I could have this. Every day.*

The thought terrified him.

He'd spent his life avoiding exactly this. Attachment. Permanence. The kind of comfort that made you forget to protect yourself.

But Noel was asleep in his coat, ribbon still around his wrist, and Eben didn't want to be anywhere else.

What if he stopped being afraid?

Dawn came. The market was complete.

Beautiful. Functional. Ready.

They'd done this. Together.

"We should rest," Noel said.

"Yeah," Eben agreed.

Neither moved.

Then: "Come on. Let's go home."

Home. Noel's apartment. Their space.

They walked back together, exhausted and triumphant.

And Eben thought: *This is what partnership looks like.*
