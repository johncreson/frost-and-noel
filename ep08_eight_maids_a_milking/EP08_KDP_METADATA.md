## BLURB

Three words. That's all it takes.

Eben Frost doesn't say things he doesn't mean. He calibrates every word, measures every statement, keeps his emotions behind walls built from years of clean exits and safer distances.

But Noel is looking at him in the early morning light, rumpled and warm and so completely *his*, and the words come out before Eben can stop them.

*"I love you."*

He's never said it before. Not to anyone. Not like this.

Noel goes very still. Then his face does something Eben has never seen—something between wonder and terror and hope so raw it hurts to witness.

The response that follows changes everything.

**Day eight of twelve. Some words can't be taken back.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring first "I love you," emotional vulnerability, grumpy-sunshine dynamics, explicit heat, and a guaranteed HEA.*
