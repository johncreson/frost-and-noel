## Chapter 1: The Collapse

**NOEL**

The holiday market collapsed. The actual, physical holiday market. Because the universe had a sense of comedic timing that Noel did not appreciate.

He stood in front of the wreckage at seven in the morning, coffee in hand, and thought: *Of course.*

The main tent was down. Completely down. Booths crushed beneath canvas and metal poles. Decorations scattered across the square like confetti after a very sad party. Tinsel everywhere. Broken ornaments glittering in the snow like tiny, festive crimes.

It looked like Christmas had gotten into a fight with a tornado and lost.

"How bad is it?" Eben appeared at his side, breath fogging in the cold.

Noel took a sip of coffee. It was already cold. "Bad."

"Scale of one to ten?"

"Eleven."

Eben surveyed the damage. Didn't flinch. Just stood there, solid and calm, like he was built for disasters. Which, Noel was starting to realize, he kind of was.

"Wind?" Eben asked.

"Apparently. Overnight. Just—" Noel gestured at the wreckage. "Took it all down."

Mayor Kringle was having what could only be described as a breakdown. Several vendors were crying. Hugh was covered in what looked like tinsel and regret, trying to untangle a string of lights from a collapsed booth while muttering something about "aesthetic catastrophe."

Sam Rook stood near the edge of the destruction, quietly assessing structural damage with the kind of calm focus that made Noel want to hug him.

Wes was already setting up a makeshift coffee station, because of course he was.

This was Tinsel Town. They didn't do disasters without caffeine.

Noel's first instinct was familiar. Immediate. Automatic.

*Fix it. Don't ask. Be useful.*

A month ago, he would have tried to rebuild the entire thing by himself using spite and caffeine. That had been his pattern. His default. The way he'd survived everything: make himself indispensable, never ask for help, never admit he couldn't handle it.

Never let anyone see him struggle.

Never let anyone think he wasn't enough.

But he'd learned something in the past week.

He'd learned that asking for help didn't make him weak. That partnership wasn't the same as dependence. That Eben standing beside him, waiting for direction instead of taking over, meant something.

It meant trust.

It meant respect.

It meant Eben saw him as an equal, not a project to manage.

"I need everyone," Noel said.

Eben looked at him. Really looked. Something shifted in his expression—surprise, maybe. Or pride.

"What?"

"I need everyone. The whole town. We can't do this alone."

The words felt strange in his mouth. Foreign. Like speaking a language he'd never learned properly.

But they felt right.

Eben's expression softened. Something warm flickered in his eyes—pride, definitely. And something else. Something that made Noel's chest tighten.

"Okay," Eben said quietly. "What do you need?"

He asked. Didn't take over. Didn't start issuing commands or pulling out a spreadsheet or reorganizing Noel's entire plan.

Just—asked.

Like Noel's answer mattered.

Like Noel was the one in charge.

Noel's chest tightened. "Call everyone. Tell them we're rebuilding. Today."

"Done."

Eben pulled out his phone. Started making calls.

Noel turned to the Mayor, who was stress-eating cookies from a tin someone had brought. "We're fixing this."

"How?" Mayor Kringle looked like he might cry into his gingerbread. "The market opens tomorrow. *Tomorrow*, Noel. We don't have time—"

"We have time," Noel said. "And we have people."

"People?"

"Yeah. The town. Everyone who's been coming to this market for years. Everyone who cares about it. We're going to ask them to help."

Mayor Kringle blinked. Looked at the destruction. Looked back at Noel.

"You think they'll come?"

"I think," Noel said, glancing at Eben, who was already on his third call, "they've been waiting for us to ask."

---

Within an hour, the town had mobilized.

Wes showed up first, carrying thermoses of coffee and a box of pastries. "Heard we're saving Christmas."

"Something like that," Noel said.

"Good. I brought fuel." Wes set up his station with military precision. "Also, you look terrible."

"Thanks."

"Festive terrible, though."

"The best kind."

Hugh arrived with tarps. So many tarps. An unreasonable number of tarps.

"You never know!" he said cheerfully, glitter somehow already in his hair despite the early hour. "Better to have too many than not enough!"

"Hugh, that's twelve tarps."

"Exactly. Not enough."

Sam came with tools. Didn't say much. Just started assessing the damage, quiet and methodical, already mentally rebuilding the entire structure.

People Noel had never met showed up with supplies and determination. Vendors brought their own materials. Families came with kids who wanted to help. Someone brought a portable heater. Someone else brought a sound system and started playing holiday music.

Mrs. Chen from the bookshop arrived with boxes of decorations she'd been saving "just in case."

The Hendersons brought lumber.

The Patels brought rope and more lights than Noel had ever seen in one place.

Found family. Assembled.

Noel stood in the middle of it all, watching the chaos organize itself into something functional, and felt his throat tighten.

This was his town.

These were his people.

And they'd shown up. For him. For this. For each other.

"You okay?" Eben asked, appearing at his elbow.

"Yeah," Noel said. "Just—this is a lot of people."

"You asked for everyone. You got everyone."

"I know." Noel smiled. "It's kind of overwhelming."

"Good overwhelming?"

"Yeah. Good overwhelming."

Eben handed him a fresh coffee. Their fingers brushed. Lingered.

"Let's get to work."

They did.

Noel organized. Eben built. They worked in sync like they'd been doing this for years, not days. Noel would call out what needed doing, and Eben would already be moving toward it. Eben would gesture toward a problem, and Noel would have a solution ready.

Someone said, "You two are impressive."

They exchanged a look. *Yeah. We are.*

The work continued. The market started to take shape again. Slowly. Deliberately. Together.

And Noel thought: *This is what asking for help looks like.*

It felt good.

It felt like something he could get used to.

It felt like maybe—just maybe—he didn't have to do everything alone.

Maybe being part of a team didn't make him weak.

Maybe it made him stronger.
