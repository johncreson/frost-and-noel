## Chapter 3: The Overnight

**NOEL**

Night fell.

Most people went home. Exhausted. Satisfied. Promising to return in the morning for the final touches.

Noel and Eben stayed.

So did a handful of others—the core crew. Wes. Hugh. Sam. A few vendors who wanted to see their booths finished.

But mostly, it was Noel and Eben.

The market was nearly done. Just final touches. Lights that needed adjusting. Decorations that needed hanging. The kind of detail work that required patience and precision and too much caffeine.

Noel was running on fumes.

He'd been awake since five. Had been moving non-stop since seven. His hands ached. His back hurt. His wrist—still bandaged from the ice rink incident—was throbbing.

But they were so close.

"Here," Eben said, handing him a fresh coffee.

Noel took it gratefully. Their fingers brushed. Lingered.

"Thanks."

"You should rest."

"So should you."

"I will. When you do."

Noel smiled. "Stubborn."

"Says the man who's been organizing a disaster recovery for twelve hours straight."

"Fair point."

They stood there for a moment, drinking coffee in the cold, watching the lights twinkle across the nearly-finished market.

"It's beautiful," Noel said quietly.

"It is."

"We did this."

"We did."

Simple. Present tense. Together.

Noel set down his coffee and went back to work.

At 3 AM, Noel found a spool of red ribbon.

It was from one of the collapsed stalls—a craft vendor who'd been selling handmade ornaments. The ribbon had survived the destruction, still wound neatly on its spool, bright red against the snow.

Noel picked it up. Wound a piece around his wrist absently, thinking about placement for the final decorations.

"Here," Eben said, appearing beside him. "Let me."

He took the ribbon. Carefully unwound the piece Noel had wrapped haphazardly around his wrist.

Then he tied it properly.

Careful. Deliberate. Like it mattered.

His fingers were gentle. Precise. The ribbon settled against Noel's skin, just above the bandage, a bright splash of color in the dim light.

"There," Eben said softly.

Noel looked down at the ribbon. Then up at Eben.

Their eyes met.

The ribbon from Day 1. The one Eben had used to tie the first gift. Now it was on Noel's wrist, tied by Eben's hands, and it meant something different.

Something more.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly.

Eben's thumb brushed across the ribbon. Across Noel's wrist. Just once. Then he stepped back.

"Come on," he said. "Still have lights to hang."

They went back to work.

But Noel kept touching the ribbon. Feeling it against his skin. A physical reminder that Eben was here. That they were doing this together.

That maybe—just maybe—this was real.

---

They worked in comfortable silence.

Installing lights. Hanging decorations. Building something together.

The others had gone home. It was just them now. Alone in the square, surrounded by half-finished beauty and the quiet hum of night.

"We're actually going to make it," Noel said.

"We are."

Noel glanced at him. Eben was focused on a string of lights, expression serious, hands steady.

"I couldn't have done this without you," Noel said.

Eben looked up. "Yes, you could have."

"Maybe. But I wouldn't have wanted to."

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. Something warm and complicated and a little bit scared.

"Noel—"

"I know," Noel said. "I know we said temporary. I know we said just for the holidays. But—"

"We should finish this," Eben said quietly. "Then we can talk."

Noel's heart stuttered. "Okay."

They went back to work.

But the air between them had changed.

Charged. Electric. Full of things unsaid.

---

Exhaustion hit Noel like a wave.

One minute he was adjusting a string of lights, the next his vision was blurring. His hands were shaking. His body was done.

"Sit," Eben said, guiding him to a stack of tarps. "Rest."

"We're not finished—"

"We're close enough. Sit."

Noel sat. Eben wrapped his coat around Noel's shoulders. The weight of it, the warmth, the smell of Eben—it was too much.

Noel's eyes closed.

"Just for a minute," he murmured.

"Take as long as you need."

The last thing Noel felt was the ribbon on his wrist and Eben's presence beside him.

Then he was gone.
