## Chapter 1: The Collapse

**NOEL**

The holiday market collapsed. The actual, physical holiday market. Because the universe had a sense of comedic timing that Noel did not appreciate.

He stood in front of the wreckage at seven in the morning, coffee in hand, and thought: *Of course.*

The main tent was down. Completely down. Booths crushed beneath canvas and metal poles. Decorations scattered across the square like confetti after a very sad party. Tinsel everywhere. Broken ornaments glittering in the snow like tiny, festive crimes.

It looked like Christmas had gotten into a fight with a tornado and lost.

"How bad is it?" Eben appeared at his side, breath fogging in the cold.

Noel took a sip of coffee. It was already cold. "Bad."

"Scale of one to ten?"

"Eleven."

Eben surveyed the damage. Didn't flinch. Just stood there, solid and calm, like he was built for disasters. Which, Noel was starting to realize, he kind of was.

"Wind?" Eben asked.

"Apparently. Overnight. Just—" Noel gestured at the wreckage. "Took it all down."

Mayor Kringle was having what could only be described as a breakdown. Several vendors were crying. Hugh was covered in what looked like tinsel and regret, trying to untangle a string of lights from a collapsed booth while muttering something about "aesthetic catastrophe."

Sam Rook stood near the edge of the destruction, quietly assessing structural damage with the kind of calm focus that made Noel want to hug him.

Wes was already setting up a makeshift coffee station, because of course he was.

This was Tinsel Town. They didn't do disasters without caffeine.

Noel's first instinct was familiar. Immediate. Automatic.

*Fix it. Don't ask. Be useful.*

A month ago, he would have tried to rebuild the entire thing by himself using spite and caffeine. That had been his pattern. His default. The way he'd survived everything: make himself indispensable, never ask for help, never admit he couldn't handle it.

Never let anyone see him struggle.

Never let anyone think he wasn't enough.

But he'd learned something in the past week.

He'd learned that asking for help didn't make him weak. That partnership wasn't the same as dependence. That Eben standing beside him, waiting for direction instead of taking over, meant something.

It meant trust.

It meant respect.

It meant Eben saw him as an equal, not a project to manage.

"I need everyone," Noel said.

Eben looked at him. Really looked. Something shifted in his expression—surprise, maybe. Or pride.

"What?"

"I need everyone. The whole town. We can't do this alone."

The words felt strange in his mouth. Foreign. Like speaking a language he'd never learned properly.

But they felt right.

Eben's expression softened. Something warm flickered in his eyes—pride, definitely. And something else. Something that made Noel's chest tighten.

"Okay," Eben said quietly. "What do you need?"

He asked. Didn't take over. Didn't start issuing commands or pulling out a spreadsheet or reorganizing Noel's entire plan.

Just—asked.

Like Noel's answer mattered.

Like Noel was the one in charge.

Noel's chest tightened. "Call everyone. Tell them we're rebuilding. Today."

"Done."

Eben pulled out his phone. Started making calls.

Noel turned to the Mayor, who was stress-eating cookies from a tin someone had brought. "We're fixing this."

"How?" Mayor Kringle looked like he might cry into his gingerbread. "The market opens tomorrow. *Tomorrow*, Noel. We don't have time—"

"We have time," Noel said. "And we have people."

"People?"

"Yeah. The town. Everyone who's been coming to this market for years. Everyone who cares about it. We're going to ask them to help."

Mayor Kringle blinked. Looked at the destruction. Looked back at Noel.

"You think they'll come?"

"I think," Noel said, glancing at Eben, who was already on his third call, "they've been waiting for us to ask."

---

Within an hour, the town had mobilized.

Wes showed up first, carrying thermoses of coffee and a box of pastries. "Heard we're saving Christmas."

"Something like that," Noel said.

"Good. I brought fuel." Wes set up his station with military precision. "Also, you look terrible."

"Thanks."

"Festive terrible, though."

"The best kind."

Hugh arrived with tarps. So many tarps. An unreasonable number of tarps.

"You never know!" he said cheerfully, glitter somehow already in his hair despite the early hour. "Better to have too many than not enough!"

"Hugh, that's twelve tarps."

"Exactly. Not enough."

Sam came with tools. Didn't say much. Just started assessing the damage, quiet and methodical, already mentally rebuilding the entire structure.

People Noel had never met showed up with supplies and determination. Vendors brought their own materials. Families came with kids who wanted to help. Someone brought a portable heater. Someone else brought a sound system and started playing holiday music.

Mrs. Chen from the bookshop arrived with boxes of decorations she'd been saving "just in case."

The Hendersons brought lumber.

The Patels brought rope and more lights than Noel had ever seen in one place.

Found family. Assembled.

Noel stood in the middle of it all, watching the chaos organize itself into something functional, and felt his throat tighten.

This was his town.

These were his people.

And they'd shown up. For him. For this. For each other.

"You okay?" Eben asked, appearing at his elbow.

"Yeah," Noel said. "Just—this is a lot of people."

"You asked for everyone. You got everyone."

"I know." Noel smiled. "It's kind of overwhelming."

"Good overwhelming?"

"Yeah. Good overwhelming."

Eben handed him a fresh coffee. Their fingers brushed. Lingered.

"Let's get to work."

They did.

Noel organized. Eben built. They worked in sync like they'd been doing this for years, not days. Noel would call out what needed doing, and Eben would already be moving toward it. Eben would gesture toward a problem, and Noel would have a solution ready.

Someone said, "You two are impressive."

They exchanged a look. *Yeah. We are.*

The work continued. The market started to take shape again. Slowly. Deliberately. Together.

And Noel thought: *This is what asking for help looks like.*

It felt good.

It felt like something he could get used to.

It felt like maybe—just maybe—he didn't have to do everything alone.

Maybe being part of a team didn't make him weak.

Maybe it made him stronger.

---

## Chapter 2: The Rally

**NOEL**

By noon, the square looked like organized chaos.

Which was, Noel reflected, better than the *dis*organized chaos they'd started with.

The main tent was back up—not perfect, but functional. Booths were being reconstructed. The sound of hammering and laughter filled the air, punctuated by the occasional curse when someone hit their thumb or discovered another broken decoration.

Wes had set up a full food station. Not just coffee and pastries anymore—he'd brought soup, sandwiches, and what looked like an entire tray of cookies shaped like reindeer.

"Did you make these this morning?" Noel asked, grabbing one.

"I don't sleep," Wes said cheerfully. "I bake."

"That's concerning."

"That's commitment."

Hugh was directing a team of volunteers on light installation, somehow managing to get glitter on everyone he passed. Sam was quietly fixing structural issues no one else had noticed. Mayor Kringle had stopped stress-eating and started coordinating vendor placement.

It was working.

They were actually doing this.

"Noel!" Someone called his name. He turned to find Mrs. Chen from the bookshop, holding a box of ornaments. "Where do you want these?"

"Uh—" He looked around, trying to remember the layout plan.

"South side," Eben said, appearing beside him. "Near the wreath booth."

Mrs. Chen nodded and headed that direction.

Noel glanced at Eben. "You memorized the layout?"

"You showed me the plan last week."

"Once."

"I pay attention."

Noel's chest did something complicated. "Yeah. You do."

They stood there for a moment, surrounded by noise and motion, and Noel felt it again—that sense of *rightness*. Like all the pieces were falling into place. Not just the market. Everything.

"We should—" Noel started.

"Yeah," Eben agreed.

They split up. Noel went to help with booth assembly. Eben went to reinforce the tent structure.

But Noel kept catching glimpses of him. Across the square. Lifting beams. Checking measurements. Moving with that quiet competence that made Noel's stomach flip.

And every time Eben looked up, their eyes met.

Every. Single. Time.

"You two are disgustingly cute," Hugh said, handing Noel a string of lights.

"We're working."

"You're making eyes at each other across a construction site."

"That's—" Noel paused. "Okay, fair."

Hugh grinned. "It's nice. Seeing you happy."

"I'm not—" Noel stopped. Because he was. He was happy. Despite the disaster. Despite the chaos. Despite everything.

He was happy.

"Yeah," he said quietly. "I guess I am."

---

By late afternoon, the market was taking real shape.

Booths were up. Lights were strung. Decorations were being hung. The whole thing looked almost—*good*.

"We're going to make it," someone said.

"We are," someone else agreed.

Noel found himself standing in the middle of the square, watching people work together. Neighbors helping neighbors. Strangers becoming friends. The whole town coming together for something that mattered.

This was what community looked like.

This was what *home* looked like.

Eben appeared at his side. Didn't say anything. Just stood there, shoulder to shoulder, watching the same scene.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly.

"For what?"

"For asking what I needed. Instead of just—taking over."

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "You're good at this. Leading. Organizing. People listen to you."

"People listen to you too."

"That's different."

"How?"

"They listen to me because I'm—" Eben paused. "Efficient. Competent. Whatever. They listen to you because they *want* to. Because you make them feel like they matter."

Noel's throat tightened. "Eben—"

"It's true." Eben's voice was soft. Certain. "You're good at this, Noel. You should know that."

First name. Eben had used his first name.

Noel looked at him. Really looked. And saw something in Eben's expression that made his heart stutter.

"We should—" Noel's voice came out rough. "We should get back to work."

"Yeah," Eben said. But he didn't move.

Neither did Noel.

They stood there, in the middle of organized chaos, surrounded by people and noise and motion, and Noel thought: *I could stay here forever.*

Not in the square.

In this moment. With Eben. Building something together.

"Come on," Eben said finally. "Still have work to do."

"Yeah," Noel agreed.

They went back to work.

But something had shifted.

Something had changed.

And Noel knew—absolutely knew—that tonight was going to matter.

He just didn't know how much.

---

## Chapter 3: The Overnight

**NOEL**

Night fell.

Most people went home. Exhausted. Satisfied. Promising to return in the morning for the final touches.

Noel and Eben stayed.

So did a handful of others—the core crew. Wes. Hugh. Sam. A few vendors who wanted to see their booths finished.

But mostly, it was Noel and Eben.

The market was nearly done. Just final touches. Lights that needed adjusting. Decorations that needed hanging. The kind of detail work that required patience and precision and too much caffeine.

Noel was running on fumes.

He'd been awake since five. Had been moving non-stop since seven. His hands ached. His back hurt. His wrist—still bandaged from the ice rink incident—was throbbing.

But they were so close.

"Here," Eben said, handing him a fresh coffee.

Noel took it gratefully. Their fingers brushed. Lingered.

"Thanks."

"You should rest."

"So should you."

"I will. When you do."

Noel smiled. "Stubborn."

"Says the man who's been organizing a disaster recovery for twelve hours straight."

"Fair point."

They stood there for a moment, drinking coffee in the cold, watching the lights twinkle across the nearly-finished market.

"It's beautiful," Noel said quietly.

"It is."

"We did this."

"We did."

Simple. Present tense. Together.

Noel set down his coffee and went back to work.

---

At 3 AM, Noel found a spool of red ribbon.

It was from one of the collapsed stalls—a craft vendor who'd been selling handmade ornaments. The ribbon had survived the destruction, still wound neatly on its spool, bright red against the snow.

Noel picked it up. Wound a piece around his wrist absently, thinking about placement for the final decorations.

"Here," Eben said, appearing beside him. "Let me."

He took the ribbon. Carefully unwound the piece Noel had wrapped haphazardly around his wrist.

Then he tied it properly.

Careful. Deliberate. Like it mattered.

His fingers were gentle. Precise. The ribbon settled against Noel's skin, just above the bandage, a bright splash of color in the dim light.

"There," Eben said softly.

Noel looked down at the ribbon. Then up at Eben.

Their eyes met.

The ribbon from Day 1. The one Eben had used to tie the first gift. Now it was on Noel's wrist, tied by Eben's hands, and it meant something different.

Something more.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly.

Eben's thumb brushed across the ribbon. Across Noel's wrist. Just once. Then he stepped back.

"Come on," he said. "Still have lights to hang."

They went back to work.

But Noel kept touching the ribbon. Feeling it against his skin. A physical reminder that Eben was here. That they were doing this together.

That maybe—just maybe—this was real.

---

They worked in comfortable silence.

Installing lights. Hanging decorations. Building something together.

The others had gone home. It was just them now. Alone in the square, surrounded by half-finished beauty and the quiet hum of night.

"We're actually going to make it," Noel said.

"We are."

Noel glanced at him. Eben was focused on a string of lights, expression serious, hands steady.

"I couldn't have done this without you," Noel said.

Eben looked up. "Yes, you could have."

"Maybe. But I wouldn't have wanted to."

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. Something warm and complicated and a little bit scared.

"Noel—"

"I know," Noel said. "I know we said temporary. I know we said just for the holidays. But—"

"We should finish this," Eben said quietly. "Then we can talk."

Noel's heart stuttered. "Okay."

They went back to work.

But the air between them had changed.

Charged. Electric. Full of things unsaid.

---

Exhaustion hit Noel like a wave.

One minute he was adjusting a string of lights, the next his vision was blurring. His hands were shaking. His body was done.

"Sit," Eben said, guiding him to a stack of tarps. "Rest."

"We're not finished—"

"We're close enough. Sit."

Noel sat. Eben wrapped his coat around Noel's shoulders. The weight of it, the warmth, the smell of Eben—it was too much.

Noel's eyes closed.

"Just for a minute," he murmured.

"Take as long as you need."

The last thing Noel felt was the ribbon on his wrist and Eben's presence beside him.

Then he was gone.

---

## Chapter 4: 3 AM Moment

**EBEN**

Eben watched Noel sleep and thought: *I could have this. Every day.*

The thought terrified him.

Noel was curled on his side, still wrapped in Eben's coat, the red ribbon bright against his wrist. His breathing was slow and even. Peaceful. Like he felt safe enough to let go completely.

Eben had never felt safe enough to let go completely.

Not once in his entire life.

But sitting here, in the cold pre-dawn quiet, watching Noel sleep—he wanted to.

He wanted to let go. To stop protecting himself. To believe that this—whatever this was—could last.

The market was done. Finished. Beautiful.

They'd built it together. From disaster to triumph in less than twenty-four hours.

Eben had rebuilt a lot of things in his life. Businesses. Strategies. His own carefully constructed walls.

But he'd never built something *with* someone before.

Not like this.

Not with someone who asked what he needed instead of telling him what to do. Not with someone who looked at him like he mattered. Not with someone who fell asleep in his coat and made it feel like a privilege instead of a burden.

Noel shifted in his sleep. Made a small sound. Settled again.

Eben's chest tightened.

*I could have this every day.*

Wake up beside him. Make coffee in his kitchen. Watch him smile over breakfast. Build things together. Fix things together. Be together.

The future stretched out in front of him, clear and terrifying and perfect.

And that was the problem.

Eben had spent his entire life avoiding exactly this. Attachment. Permanence. The kind of comfort that made you forget to protect yourself.

Because comfort was dangerous.

Comfort made you soft. Made you vulnerable. Made you believe that good things could last.

And in Eben's experience, good things never lasted.

People left. Situations changed. The ground shifted beneath you when you least expected it.

The only way to survive was to stay ready. Stay sharp. Stay unattached.

But Noel was asleep in his coat, ribbon still around his wrist, and Eben didn't want to be anywhere else.

He didn't want to stay sharp.

He wanted to stay *here*.

---

Dawn came slowly.

Pink light spreading across the sky. The market lights twinkling in the growing brightness. Everything they'd built, illuminated.

Eben sat beside Noel and watched it happen.

Watched the world wake up.

Watched the market come to life.

Watched Noel sleep, peaceful and trusting, and thought: *What if I stopped being afraid?*

What if he let himself want this?

What if he let himself believe it could last?

What if—just this once—he chose comfort over safety?

The questions sat heavy in his chest.

Unanswered.

Unanswerable.

But there, nonetheless.

---

Noel woke slowly.

Blinked. Focused. Saw Eben sitting beside him.

"Hey," he said, voice rough with sleep.

"Hey."

"Did I—how long was I out?"

"Twenty minutes. Maybe thirty."

"Sorry."

"Don't be." Eben's voice came out softer than he meant it to. "You needed it."

Noel sat up. Looked around. Saw the finished market.

"We did it," he said.

"We did."

"Together."

"Yeah," Eben said. "Together."

The word felt significant. Heavy. Like a promise he wasn't sure he knew how to keep.

But he wanted to.

God, he wanted to.

They sat there, side by side, watching the sun rise over what they'd built.

And Eben thought: *I'm going to try.*

Try to stop being afraid.

Try to believe this could last.

Try to be the person Noel deserved.

Even if it terrified him.

Even if he didn't know how.

Even if every instinct he had was screaming at him to run.

He was going to try.

"Come on," he said quietly. "Let's go home."

Home.

The word felt right.

Felt real.

Felt like something he could have, if he was brave enough to reach for it.

They stood. Walked back together through the empty streets, exhausted and triumphant.

And Eben let himself imagine—just for a moment—what it would be like to do this every day.

To build things with Noel. To watch him sleep. To go home together.

To stay.

The thought still terrified him.

But maybe—just maybe—it was worth being terrified for.

---

## Chapter 5: The Finish

**NOEL**

The sun rose over the market, and it was perfect.

Not perfect in the technical sense—there were still crooked lights and slightly off-center decorations and at least three places where Hugh's glitter had permanently embedded itself in the infrastructure.

But perfect in the way that mattered.

They'd done this. Together. Built something from nothing overnight.

Noel stood at the edge of the square, coffee in hand, and watched the town start to arrive.

Vendors setting up their wares. Families coming to see the finished market. Mayor Kringle practically vibrating with relief and excitement.

"This is incredible!" the Mayor said, approaching Noel with tears in his eyes. "I can't believe—we did it. We actually did it."

"We did," Noel agreed.

"You did," Mayor Kringle corrected. "You organized this. You brought everyone together. You saved the market."

Noel shook his head. "It wasn't just me."

"No," Eben said, appearing at his side. "It wasn't."

Their eyes met.

And Noel felt it again—that sense of *rightness*. Like all the pieces had fallen into place. Like this was exactly where he was supposed to be.

Not just in the square.

Here. With Eben. Building things together.

"You two," Mayor Kringle said, smiling. "You're quite the team."

"Yeah," Noel said softly. "We are."

---

The market filled with people.

Vendors calling out their wares. Children running between booths. The smell of cinnamon and pine and fresh coffee filling the air.

It was everything they'd hoped for.

Everything they'd worked for.

Everything they'd built.

Noel moved through the crowd, checking on vendors, making sure everything was running smoothly. People kept stopping him to say thank you. To shake his hand. To tell him how much this meant to them.

And every time he looked up, Eben was there.

Across the square. Beside a booth. Helping someone carry something.

Always there.

Always watching.

Always present.

Their eyes met across the crowd, and Noel's heart stuttered.

This was what partnership looked like.

Not just the work. Not just the building.

The being there. The showing up. The choosing each other, again and again, in a hundred small ways.

---

By mid-morning, the market was in full swing.

Successful. Thriving. Alive.

Noel found a quiet corner and just—breathed.

They'd done it.

Against all odds, against the disaster, against the timeline—they'd done it.

"Hey," Eben said, appearing beside him.

"Hey."

"You okay?"

"Yeah." Noel smiled. "Just—taking it in."

"It's a lot."

"It is."

They stood there, side by side, watching the market they'd saved.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly.

"For what?"

"For being here. For all of this."

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "Where else would I be?"

The question landed like a touch.

Noel looked at him. Really looked.

Eben's expression was soft. Open. More vulnerable than Noel had ever seen it.

"I don't know," Noel said. "But I'm glad you're here."

"Me too."

They stood there, surrounded by noise and motion and celebration, and Noel felt something shift.

Something settle.

Something click into place.

"We should rest," he said quietly.

"Yeah," Eben agreed.

"Your place or mine?"

Eben's breath caught. Just slightly. Just enough for Noel to notice.

"Yours," Eben said. "If that's okay."

"It's more than okay."

---

They walked back together.

Through the busy streets. Past the celebrating crowds. Away from the market and toward something quieter. Something private.

Something theirs.

Noel's apartment was warm when they got there. Safe. Familiar.

Home.

"Coffee?" Noel asked.

"Sure."

Noel moved to the kitchen. Started the coffee maker. Felt Eben's presence behind him, solid and steady.

"Noel," Eben said quietly.

Noel turned.

Eben was standing in the middle of the living room, looking at him with an expression that made Noel's heart race.

"Yeah?"

"I—" Eben paused. Swallowed. "I need to tell you something."

Noel's stomach flipped. "Okay."

"I'm not good at this. At—feelings. At talking about things that matter."

"I know."

"But I need you to know—" Eben's voice was rough. Raw. "These past few days. This week. Being with you. Building this. I—"

He stopped. Looked away.

Noel crossed the room. Stood in front of him. Close enough to touch.

"Eben," he said softly. "Look at me."

Eben did.

"You don't have to explain," Noel said. "I know."

"You know?"

"Yeah." Noel smiled. "I know."

Because he did.

He knew what Eben was trying to say.

He knew because he felt it too.

This wasn't temporary anymore.

This wasn't just for the holidays.

This was real.

"I should rest," Eben said quietly. "We both should."

"Yeah," Noel agreed.

But neither of them moved.

They stood there, in Noel's apartment, exhausted and triumphant and terrified and hopeful, and Noel thought: *This is it.*

This is the moment everything changes.

"Stay," he said quietly.

Eben's eyes met his. "I am."

"No," Noel said. "I mean—stay. Not just for today. Not just for the holidays."

The words hung between them.

Heavy. Significant. Irreversible.

"Noel—"

"I know what we said," Noel continued. "I know we said temporary. I know we said just for fun. But I don't want temporary anymore. I want you. Here. With me."

He stopped. Took a breath.

"I want you to stay."

The silence stretched.

Long enough to hurt.

Long enough for Noel to wonder if he'd made a terrible mistake.

Then Eben said, voice barely above a whisper: "I'm not going anywhere."

Five words.

Everything.

Noel's breath caught. "You mean that?"

"Yeah," Eben said. "I mean that."

And Noel believed him.

---

## Chapter 6: Home Space

**NOEL**

The coffee finished brewing.

Neither of them moved to get it.

They stood in Noel's living room, facing each other, and the air between them felt electric. Charged. Full of possibility and terror in equal measure.

"I'm not going anywhere," Eben had said.

And Noel had believed him.

But now—standing here, in the aftermath of that confession—Noel didn't know what came next.

"You should sit," Eben said quietly.

"I'm okay standing."

"Noel."

The way Eben said his name—soft, careful, like it mattered—made Noel's knees weak.

"Okay," he said. "Sitting."

They moved to the couch. Sat down. Close but not touching.

The space between them felt enormous.

"I meant it," Eben said. "What I said. I'm not going anywhere."

"I know."

"But I need you to understand—" Eben paused. Looked down at his hands. "I'm not good at this. At staying. At—commitment. At believing good things can last."

"I know that too."

"And I'm going to mess up. I'm going to get scared. I'm going to—" Eben's voice cracked slightly. "I'm going to want to run."

Noel's chest tightened. "Okay."

"But I don't want to run from you."

"Okay."

"I want to try. To stay. To—" Eben looked up. Met Noel's eyes. "To be the person you deserve."

Noel's throat closed. "Eben—"

"I'm not promising I'll be perfect. I'm not promising I won't fuck this up. But I'm promising I'll try."

The words settled between them. Heavy. Real. More than Noel had dared to hope for.

"That's all I'm asking," Noel said quietly. "Just—try. Be here. Be present. That's enough."

"Is it?"

"Yeah." Noel reached out. Took Eben's hand. "It is."

Their fingers laced together. The ribbon on Noel's wrist brushed against Eben's skin.

"I'm scared," Eben admitted.

"Me too."

"You are?"

"Yeah." Noel smiled. "I'm terrified. I've never—this is new for me too. Wanting someone to stay. Believing they might actually want to."

"I want to."

"I know."

They sat there, holding hands, and Noel felt something in his chest loosen.

This was real.

This was happening.

This was—

"I should tell you something," Noel said.

"Okay."

"I'm not easy to be with. I overwork. I don't ask for help. I—" Noel paused. "I have a habit of making myself useful instead of letting myself be wanted."

Eben's grip tightened. "I've noticed."

"And I'm working on it. But it's hard. And I'm going to slip up. I'm going to—"

"Noel," Eben interrupted gently. "I know. I see you. All of it. And I'm still here."

Noel's eyes stung. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They sat there, hands clasped, and Noel thought: *This is what commitment looks like.*

Not perfect. Not easy. Just—honest. Present. Trying.

"So," Noel said. "We're doing this?"

"We're doing this."

"For real?"

"For real."

Noel smiled. "Okay."

"Okay."

---

The coffee was probably cold by now.

Neither of them cared.

They sat on the couch, close enough to touch, and just—existed. Together.

"I should sleep," Eben said eventually. "We both should."

"Yeah."

"But I don't want to move."

"Me neither."

Eben's thumb traced circles on the back of Noel's hand. Slow. Deliberate. Grounding.

"Tonight," Noel said quietly. "Tomorrow. However long you want."

"I will."

"Promise?"

Eben looked at him. Really looked. And Noel saw everything in that gaze—fear and hope and determination and something that looked dangerously close to love.

"I promise," Eben said.

And Noel believed him.

---

They moved to the bedroom eventually.

Not for sleep. Not yet.

Just—to be closer. To be together. To make this real.

Noel sat on the edge of the bed. Eben stood in front of him.

"I need you to know something," Noel said. Because he needed to say it. Needed Eben to hear it. "This matters. *You* matter. I'm not asking you to be here because I need someone. I'm asking because I want *you*."

Eben's breath caught.

"I want you," Noel repeated. "Exactly as you are. Scared and guarded and terrible at feelings. I want all of it. I want *you*."

Eben knelt in front of him. Took his face in both hands.

"I'm not going anywhere," he said. "I promise."

Their foreheads touched.

"Okay," Noel whispered.

"Okay."

And then Eben kissed him.

Slow. Deliberate. Like a promise.

Like a beginning.

Like everything Noel had ever wanted and never thought he'd get to keep.

"I'm here," Eben whispered against his mouth. "I'm right here."

And he was.

He was here.

And Noel let himself believe it.

---

## Chapter 7: Commitment Sex

**EBEN**

They kissed.

Slow. Deliberate. Different from every other time.

This wasn't desperate. Wasn't frantic. Wasn't driven by temporary want or holiday magic or the excuse of "just for now."

This was *permanent*.

This was "I'm not going anywhere."

This was everything.

Noel's hands found Eben's shoulders. Pulled him closer. Eben came willingly, settling between Noel's knees, hands framing his face like he was something precious. Like he was worth holding carefully.

"I've got you," Eben murmured against his mouth.

"I know," Noel breathed back.

And he did. He knew.

Eben had been showing him for days. In a hundred small ways. The coat offered without being asked. The coffee handed over at exactly the right moment. The way he stood beside Noel instead of in front of him.

The way he'd chosen to be here.

They moved together. Slowly. Carefully. Like they had all the time in the world.

Because they did.

They had time now. They had permanence. They had each other.

No more counting down days. No more "just until Christmas." No more pretending this was temporary when it had stopped being temporary somewhere around Day 3.

Eben's hands slid under Noel's shirt. Warm. Steady. Grounding.

Noel shivered. Not from cold. From want. From the overwhelming reality that this was happening. That Eben was here. That he'd promised.

"Is this okay?" Eben asked, fingers pausing at the hem.

"Yes."

"You'll tell me if—"

"I will." Noel kissed him again. Deeper. "I promise. But I'm okay. I'm—more than okay."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They undressed slowly. Piece by piece. No rush. No urgency.

Just—presence. Attention. Care.

Noel's shirt. Eben's sweater. Jeans discarded. Socks kicked off somewhere near the nightstand.

Every piece of clothing removed felt like a layer of protection shed. A wall coming down. A choice to be vulnerable.

To be seen.

To be wanted, exactly as they were.

Eben's fingers traced the bandage on Noel's wrist. Then the ribbon, still tied there, bright red against his skin.

"You kept it," he said softly.

"Of course I did."

"It's just ribbon."

"No," Noel said. "It's not."

Their eyes met.

And Eben understood.

It wasn't just ribbon. It was a symbol. A reminder. A promise made physical.

The ribbon from Day 1, when this had all started. When Eben had tied the first gift and looked at Noel like he was a problem to be solved.

Now he looked at Noel like he was the answer.

"I'm not going anywhere," Eben said.

"I know."

"I need you to know. I need—" Eben's voice caught. "I need you to believe me."

"I do," Noel said. "I believe you."

Eben kissed him. Deeper this time. More certain. Like he was trying to prove it with his mouth, his hands, his whole body.

*I'm here. I'm yours.*

They moved to the bed properly. Lay down together. Skin against skin. Heart against heart.

The sheets were cool. Eben's body was warm. Noel pressed closer, needing the contact, needing the proof that this was real.

"I want you," Noel said.

"You have me."

"For real?"

"For real."

Noel's throat tightened. "Say it again."

"You have me," Eben repeated. "All of me. For as long as you want me."

"Forever, then."

Eben's breath caught. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

"Okay," Eben said softly. "Forever."

---

They took their time.

Touching. Tasting. Learning each other like this was the first time, even though it wasn't.

But it felt like the first time.

Because this time, it meant something different.

This time, it meant forever.

Eben's mouth traced a path down Noel's throat. Across his collarbone. Down his chest. Every touch deliberate. Intentional. Like he was memorizing Noel's body. Like he had all the time in the world to learn it.

Because he did.

They had time now.

They had forever.

"Eben," Noel breathed.

"I'm here."

"I know. I just—I wanted to say your name."

Eben lifted his head. Met Noel's eyes. "Say it again."

"Eben."

"Again."

"Eben."

The name settled between them. Intimate. Real. Theirs.

Not "Frost." Not the surname he used as armor. Just—Eben. The person beneath the walls. The man who'd promised to stay.

They moved together. Slow and deliberate. Eyes open. Watching each other.

Noel had never been good at eye contact during sex. It felt too vulnerable. Too exposing. Too much like letting someone see all the parts of him he usually kept hidden.

But with Eben, he couldn't look away.

Didn't want to look away.

Wanted to see everything. Wanted to be seen.

"Is this okay?" Eben asked, voice rough.

"Yes."

"You're sure?"

"I'm sure. Are you?"

"Yeah." Eben's hands tightened on Noel's hips. "I'm sure."

They found their rhythm. Easy. Natural. Like they'd been doing this forever.

Like they'd do it forever.

The thought should terrify Eben. He'd spent his whole life avoiding forever. Avoiding permanence. Avoiding the kind of attachment that could break him when it inevitably ended.

But this didn't feel like it would end.

This felt like it was just beginning.

"I've got you," Eben murmured.

"I know."

"I mean it."

"I know," Noel said. "I believe you."

And Eben could see it in his eyes.

He believed it with everything he had.

---

After—when they were tangled together, breathless and sated and whole—Eben pressed his face into Noel's shoulder and said, "I love you."

The words were quiet. Almost inaudible.

But Noel heard them.

His heart stopped. Restarted. Stuttered.

"What?" he whispered.

Eben lifted his head. Met his eyes.

And Noel saw it there. The fear. The vulnerability. The terrifying honesty of someone who'd just handed over their heart and was waiting to see if it would be kept safe.

"I love you," Eben said again. Clearer this time. Certain. "I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to be good at this. But I love you."

Noel's eyes stung. His throat closed. His chest felt too full, like his heart was trying to expand beyond the space his ribs allowed.

"Eben—"

"You don't have to say it back. I just needed you to know."

"I love you too," Noel said. "I love you too."

Eben's breath shuddered out. Relief. Joy. Something that looked dangerously close to tears.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." Noel cupped his face. "I love you. I'm pretty sure I've loved you since you fixed my spreadsheet on Day 2 and didn't make me feel stupid about it."

Eben laughed. Soft. Surprised. "That's when you knew?"

"That's when I started suspecting. I knew for sure when you stayed with me at the ice rink. When you didn't leave even though I told you to."

"I couldn't leave."

"I know."

They kissed. Soft. Sweet. Perfect.

"I promise," Eben said quietly.

"I know," Noel said. "I believe you."

And he did.

He believed it with everything he had.

---

They fell asleep like that.

Tangled together. Holding each other. Safe.

For the first time in either of their lives, they fell asleep believing that this—this closeness, this connection, this *love*—could last.

That it would last.

That they would make it last.

Together.

Noel's last thought before sleep claimed him was: *This is what it feels like.*

And it felt perfect.

It felt like home.

It felt like forever.

And for the first time in his life, forever didn't scare him.

It felt exactly right.

## Chapter 8: Hook Ending

**EBEN**

Morning came too soon.

Eben woke to sunlight streaming through Noel's bedroom window, warm and golden and perfect.

Noel was still asleep beside him. Curled into Eben's side. Breathing slow and even. The ribbon still on his wrist, bright red against his skin.

Eben lay there, watching him sleep, and thought: *I said I love you.*

He'd said it.

Out loud.

To another person.

And he'd meant it.

The realization should terrify him.

It did terrify him.

But lying here, with Noel warm and safe beside him, the terror felt—manageable. Distant. Like something he could handle.

Like something he could survive.

Carefully, Eben extracted himself from the bed. Noel made a small sound of protest but didn't wake. Just curled into the warm spot Eben had left behind.

Eben pulled on his jeans and padded to the kitchen.

Started the coffee maker.

Opened the cabinet to get mugs.

Knew exactly where everything was.

The realization hit him like a physical blow.

*I know where everything is.*

*I fit here.*

He'd been in this apartment—what, a handful of times? And already he knew Noel's kitchen. Knew where the coffee was kept. Knew which mug Noel preferred. Knew how he took his coffee.

Knew him.

And Noel knew him back.

Knew his tells. Knew his fears. Knew the parts of him he'd spent his entire life hiding.

And wanted him anyway.

The thought should comfort him.

It scared him instead.

---

Eben poured two cups of coffee.

Added cream to Noel's. Left his own black.

Stood in the kitchen and stared at the mugs like they held the answers to questions he didn't know how to ask.

This was everything he'd spent his life avoiding.

Attachment. Belonging. The kind of happiness that had teeth, that could bite back if you weren't careful.

Because happiness was dangerous.

Happiness made you soft. Made you vulnerable. Made you believe that good things could last.

And in Eben's experience, good things never lasted.

People left. Situations changed. The ground shifted beneath you when you least expected it.

The only way to survive was to stay ready. Stay sharp. Stay unattached.

But he'd said *I love you*.

He'd promised to stay.

And he'd meant it.

So what now?

---

"You're up early."

Eben turned. Noel was standing in the doorway, wearing Eben's shirt, hair mussed from sleep, smiling like Eben was the best thing he'd ever seen.

"Couldn't sleep," Eben said.

"Everything okay?"

"Yeah. Just—thinking."

Noel crossed to him. Took the coffee mug Eben offered. "Good thinking or bad thinking?"

"I don't know yet."

Noel studied him. "You want to talk about it?"

"Not yet."

"Okay." Noel kissed his cheek. Soft. Easy. Like it was the most natural thing in the world. "Let me know when you're ready."

And that was it.

No pressure. No demands. Just—patience. Trust. Space.

Eben's chest tightened.

"You stayed," Noel said softly.

"Yeah."

"I wasn't sure you would. When I woke up and you weren't there, I thought—" Noel paused. "But you're here. Making coffee. In my kitchen."

"I'm here."

"Good." Noel smiled. "I like you here."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They stood there, drinking coffee in the morning light, and Eben thought: *This is everything I've ever wanted.*

And that was exactly why he was afraid.

Because wanting something this much meant it could be taken away.

Because happiness this complete meant the fall would be devastating.

Because love—real love, the kind that lasted—required trust.

And Eben didn't know if he knew how to trust that much.

---

"What are you thinking?" Noel asked.

"That I'm scared," Eben admitted.

"Of what?"

"This. Us. How much I want this to work."

Noel set down his coffee. Took Eben's hands. "I'm scared too."

"You are?"

"Yeah. I've never—" Noel paused. "I've never wanted someone to stay before. Not like this. And I'm worried I'm going to mess it up. That I'm going to—"

"You won't."

"You don't know that."

"I know you," Eben said. "And I trust you."

"Even though you're scared?"

"Especially because I'm scared."

Noel smiled. "That doesn't make sense."

"I know." Eben pulled him closer. "But it's true."

They stood there, holding each other in the kitchen, and Eben thought: *I can do this.*

*I can be brave.*

*I can stay.*

Even if it scared him.

Even if he didn't know how.

Even if every instinct he had was screaming at him to protect himself.

He could stay.

For Noel.

For this.

For them.

---

"Three days left," Noel said quietly.

"Until what?"

"Until Christmas. Until the twelve days are over."

Eben's stomach dropped. "Right."

"What happens then?"

"I don't know."

"Do you—" Noel paused. "Do you still want this? After the holidays?"

"Yes," Eben said immediately. "Yes. I told you. I'm not going anywhere."

"Okay." Noel relaxed slightly. "Okay. Good."

"Did you think I'd change my mind?"

"I don't know. Maybe. I just—" Noel looked away. "I wanted to make sure."

Eben turned his face back. Made him look. "I'm not going anywhere. I meant what I said. I love you."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Noel kissed him. Soft. Sweet. Trusting.

And Eben kissed him back and thought: *I'm going to make this work.*

*I'm going to be the person he deserves.*

*I'm going to stay.*

Even if it killed him.

Even if it scared him to his core.

Even if he had no idea how.

He was going to try.

---

They finished their coffee.

Made breakfast together. Moved around each other in the kitchen like they'd been doing this for years.

And Eben thought: *This is what it looks like.*

Ordinary. Domestic. Real.

And absolutely terrifying.

Because this was everything he'd ever wanted.

And that was exactly why he was afraid.

But he was staying anyway.

For Noel.

For this.

For them.

Three days left.

And then—

Everything was about to change.

Eben could feel it.

The fear lurking beneath the happiness. The sense that something was coming. That this perfect moment couldn't last.

But he pushed it down.

Ignored it.

Focused on Noel, smiling at him over breakfast, ribbon still on his wrist, looking at Eben like he was everything.

And Eben thought: *How long before I ruin this?*

The thought whispered through him, quiet and insidious.

But he ignored it.

For now.

For this moment.

He ignored it.

And let himself be happy.

Even though it scared him.

Even though he knew—absolutely knew—that something was coming.

Something that would test everything they'd just promised each other.

But for now, he was here.

He was with Noel.

And that had to be enough.
