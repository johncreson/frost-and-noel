## Chapter 8: Hook Ending

**EBEN**

Morning came too soon.

Eben woke to sunlight streaming through Noel's bedroom window, warm and golden and perfect.

Noel was still asleep beside him. Curled into Eben's side. Breathing slow and even. The ribbon still on his wrist, bright red against his skin.

Eben lay there, watching him sleep, and thought: *I said I love you.*

He'd said it.

Out loud.

To another person.

And he'd meant it.

The realization should terrify him.

It did terrify him.

But lying here, with Noel warm and safe beside him, the terror felt—manageable. Distant. Like something he could handle.

Like something he could survive.

Carefully, Eben extracted himself from the bed. Noel made a small sound of protest but didn't wake. Just curled into the warm spot Eben had left behind.

Eben pulled on his jeans and padded to the kitchen.

Started the coffee maker.

Opened the cabinet to get mugs.

Knew exactly where everything was.

The realization hit him like a physical blow.

*I know where everything is.*

*I fit here.*

He'd been in this apartment—what, a handful of times? And already he knew Noel's kitchen. Knew where the coffee was kept. Knew which mug Noel preferred. Knew how he took his coffee.

Knew him.

And Noel knew him back.

Knew his tells. Knew his fears. Knew the parts of him he'd spent his entire life hiding.

And wanted him anyway.

The thought should comfort him.

It scared him instead.

---

Eben poured two cups of coffee.

Added cream to Noel's. Left his own black.

Stood in the kitchen and stared at the mugs like they held the answers to questions he didn't know how to ask.

This was everything he'd spent his life avoiding.

Attachment. Belonging. The kind of happiness that had teeth, that could bite back if you weren't careful.

Because happiness was dangerous.

Happiness made you soft. Made you vulnerable. Made you believe that good things could last.

And in Eben's experience, good things never lasted.

People left. Situations changed. The ground shifted beneath you when you least expected it.

The only way to survive was to stay ready. Stay sharp. Stay unattached.

But he'd said *I love you*.

He'd promised to stay.

And he'd meant it.

So what now?

---

"You're up early."

Eben turned. Noel was standing in the doorway, wearing Eben's shirt, hair mussed from sleep, smiling like Eben was the best thing he'd ever seen.

"Couldn't sleep," Eben said.

"Everything okay?"

"Yeah. Just—thinking."

Noel crossed to him. Took the coffee mug Eben offered. "Good thinking or bad thinking?"

"I don't know yet."

Noel studied him. "You want to talk about it?"

"Not yet."

"Okay." Noel kissed his cheek. Soft. Easy. Like it was the most natural thing in the world. "Let me know when you're ready."

And that was it.

No pressure. No demands. Just—patience. Trust. Space.

Eben's chest tightened.

"You stayed," Noel said softly.

"Yeah."

"I wasn't sure you would. When I woke up and you weren't there, I thought—" Noel paused. "But you're here. Making coffee. In my kitchen."

"I'm here."

"Good." Noel smiled. "I like you here."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They stood there, drinking coffee in the morning light, and Eben thought: *This is everything I've ever wanted.*

And that was exactly why he was afraid.

Because wanting something this much meant it could be taken away.

Because happiness this complete meant the fall would be devastating.

Because love—real love, the kind that lasted—required trust.

And Eben didn't know if he knew how to trust that much.

---

"What are you thinking?" Noel asked.

"That I'm scared," Eben admitted.

"Of what?"

"This. Us. How much I want this to work."

Noel set down his coffee. Took Eben's hands. "I'm scared too."

"You are?"

"Yeah. I've never—" Noel paused. "I've never wanted someone to stay before. Not like this. And I'm worried I'm going to mess it up. That I'm going to—"

"You won't."

"You don't know that."

"I know you," Eben said. "And I trust you."

"Even though you're scared?"

"Especially because I'm scared."

Noel smiled. "That doesn't make sense."

"I know." Eben pulled him closer. "But it's true."

They stood there, holding each other in the kitchen, and Eben thought: *I can do this.*

*I can be brave.*

*I can stay.*

Even if it scared him.

Even if he didn't know how.

Even if every instinct he had was screaming at him to protect himself.

He could stay.

For Noel.

For this.

For them.

---

"Three days left," Noel said quietly.

"Until what?"

"Until Christmas. Until the twelve days are over."

Eben's stomach dropped. "Right."

"What happens then?"

"I don't know."

"Do you—" Noel paused. "Do you still want this? After the holidays?"

"Yes," Eben said immediately. "Yes. I told you. I'm not going anywhere."

"Okay." Noel relaxed slightly. "Okay. Good."

"Did you think I'd change my mind?"

"I don't know. Maybe. I just—" Noel looked away. "I wanted to make sure."

Eben turned his face back. Made him look. "I'm not going anywhere. I meant what I said. I love you."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Noel kissed him. Soft. Sweet. Trusting.

And Eben kissed him back and thought: *I'm going to make this work.*

*I'm going to be the person he deserves.*

*I'm going to stay.*

Even if it killed him.

Even if it scared him to his core.

Even if he had no idea how.

He was going to try.

---

They finished their coffee.

Made breakfast together. Moved around each other in the kitchen like they'd been doing this for years.

And Eben thought: *This is what it looks like.*

Ordinary. Domestic. Real.

And absolutely terrifying.

Because this was everything he'd ever wanted.

And that was exactly why he was afraid.

But he was staying anyway.

For Noel.

For this.

For them.

Three days left.

And then—

Everything was about to change.

Eben could feel it.

The fear lurking beneath the happiness. The sense that something was coming. That this perfect moment couldn't last.

But he pushed it down.

Ignored it.

Focused on Noel, smiling at him over breakfast, ribbon still on his wrist, looking at Eben like he was everything.

And Eben thought: *How long before I ruin this?*

The thought whispered through him, quiet and insidious.

But he ignored it.

For now.

For this moment.

He ignored it.

And let himself be happy.

Even though it scared him.

Even though he knew—absolutely knew—that something was coming.

Something that would test everything they'd just promised each other.

But for now, he was here.

He was with Noel.

And that had to be enough.
