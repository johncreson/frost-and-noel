## Chapter 5: The Finish

**NOEL**

The sun rose over the market, and it was perfect.

Not perfect in the technical sense—there were still crooked lights and slightly off-center decorations and at least three places where Hugh's glitter had permanently embedded itself in the infrastructure.

But perfect in the way that mattered.

They'd done this. Together. Built something from nothing overnight.

Noel stood at the edge of the square, coffee in hand, and watched the town start to arrive.

Vendors setting up their wares. Families coming to see the finished market. Mayor Kringle practically vibrating with relief and excitement.

"This is incredible!" the Mayor said, approaching Noel with tears in his eyes. "I can't believe—we did it. We actually did it."

"We did," Noel agreed.

"You did," Mayor Kringle corrected. "You organized this. You brought everyone together. You saved the market."

Noel shook his head. "It wasn't just me."

"No," Eben said, appearing at his side. "It wasn't."

Their eyes met.

And Noel felt it again—that sense of *rightness*. Like all the pieces had fallen into place. Like this was exactly where he was supposed to be.

Not just in the square.

Here. With Eben. Building things together.

"You two," Mayor Kringle said, smiling. "You're quite the team."

"Yeah," Noel said softly. "We are."

---

The market filled with people.

Vendors calling out their wares. Children running between booths. The smell of cinnamon and pine and fresh coffee filling the air.

It was everything they'd hoped for.

Everything they'd worked for.

Everything they'd built.

Noel moved through the crowd, checking on vendors, making sure everything was running smoothly. People kept stopping him to say thank you. To shake his hand. To tell him how much this meant to them.

And every time he looked up, Eben was there.

Across the square. Beside a booth. Helping someone carry something.

Always there.

Always watching.

Always present.

Their eyes met across the crowd, and Noel's heart stuttered.

This was what partnership looked like.

Not just the work. Not just the building.

The being there. The showing up. The choosing each other, again and again, in a hundred small ways.

---

By mid-morning, the market was in full swing.

Successful. Thriving. Alive.

Noel found a quiet corner and just—breathed.

They'd done it.

Against all odds, against the disaster, against the timeline—they'd done it.

"Hey," Eben said, appearing beside him.

"Hey."

"You okay?"

"Yeah." Noel smiled. "Just—taking it in."

"It's a lot."

"It is."

They stood there, side by side, watching the market they'd saved.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly.

"For what?"

"For being here. For all of this."

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "Where else would I be?"

The question landed like a touch.

Noel looked at him. Really looked.

Eben's expression was soft. Open. More vulnerable than Noel had ever seen it.

"I don't know," Noel said. "But I'm glad you're here."

"Me too."

They stood there, surrounded by noise and motion and celebration, and Noel felt something shift.

Something settle.

Something click into place.

"We should rest," he said quietly.

"Yeah," Eben agreed.

"Your place or mine?"

Eben's breath caught. Just slightly. Just enough for Noel to notice.

"Yours," Eben said. "If that's okay."

"It's more than okay."

---

They walked back together.

Through the busy streets. Past the celebrating crowds. Away from the market and toward something quieter. Something private.

Something theirs.

Noel's apartment was warm when they got there. Safe. Familiar.

Home.

"Coffee?" Noel asked.

"Sure."

Noel moved to the kitchen. Started the coffee maker. Felt Eben's presence behind him, solid and steady.

"Noel," Eben said quietly.

Noel turned.

Eben was standing in the middle of the living room, looking at him with an expression that made Noel's heart race.

"Yeah?"

"I—" Eben paused. Swallowed. "I need to tell you something."

Noel's stomach flipped. "Okay."

"I'm not good at this. At—feelings. At talking about things that matter."

"I know."

"But I need you to know—" Eben's voice was rough. Raw. "These past few days. This week. Being with you. Building this. I—"

He stopped. Looked away.

Noel crossed the room. Stood in front of him. Close enough to touch.

"Eben," he said softly. "Look at me."

Eben did.

"You don't have to explain," Noel said. "I know."

"You know?"

"Yeah." Noel smiled. "I know."

Because he did.

He knew what Eben was trying to say.

He knew because he felt it too.

This wasn't temporary anymore.

This wasn't just for the holidays.

This was real.

"I should rest," Eben said quietly. "We both should."

"Yeah," Noel agreed.

But neither of them moved.

They stood there, in Noel's apartment, exhausted and triumphant and terrified and hopeful, and Noel thought: *This is it.*

This is the moment everything changes.

"Stay," he said quietly.

Eben's eyes met his. "I am."

"No," Noel said. "I mean—stay. Not just for today. Not just for the holidays."

The words hung between them.

Heavy. Significant. Irreversible.

"Noel—"

"I know what we said," Noel continued. "I know we said temporary. I know we said just for fun. But I don't want temporary anymore. I want you. Here. With me."

He stopped. Took a breath.

"I want you to stay."

The silence stretched.

Long enough to hurt.

Long enough for Noel to wonder if he'd made a terrible mistake.

Then Eben said, voice barely above a whisper: "I'm not going anywhere."

Five words.

Everything.

Noel's breath caught. "You mean that?"

"Yeah," Eben said. "I mean that."

And Noel believed him.
