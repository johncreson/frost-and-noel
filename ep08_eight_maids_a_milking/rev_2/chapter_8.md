## Chapter 8: Hook Ending

**EBEN**

Morning came too soon.

Eben woke to sunlight streaming through Noel's bedroom window, warm and golden and perfect.

Noel was still asleep beside him. Curled into Eben's side. Breathing slow and even. The ribbon still on his wrist, bright red against his skin.

Eben lay there, watching him sleep, and thought: *I said I love you.*

He'd said it. Out loud. To another person.

And he'd meant it.

The realization should terrify him.

It did.

But lying here, with Noel warm and safe beside him, the terror felt—manageable. Distant. Like something he could handle.

Like something he could survive.

Carefully, Eben extracted himself from the bed. Noel made a small sound of protest but didn't wake. Just curled into the warm spot Eben had left behind.

Eben pulled on his jeans and padded to the kitchen.

Started the coffee maker.

Opened the cabinet to get mugs.

Knew exactly where everything was.

*I know where everything is.*

*I fit here.*

He'd been in this apartment—what, a handful of times? And already he knew Noel's kitchen. Knew where the coffee was kept. Knew which mug Noel preferred. Knew how he took his coffee.

Knew him.

And Noel knew him back.

Knew his tells. Knew his fears. Knew the parts of him he'd spent his entire life hiding.

And wanted him anyway.

Eben poured two cups of coffee.

Added cream to Noel's. Left his own black.

His phone buzzed on the counter. Work email.

He glanced at the preview: *Contract extension - New York office - decision needed by...*

Eben looked toward the bedroom. Noel was still asleep.

He swiped the notification away without opening it.

Later. He'd deal with it later.

---

"You're up early."

Eben turned. Noel was standing in the doorway, wearing Eben's shirt, hair mussed from sleep, smiling like Eben was the best thing he'd ever seen.

"Couldn't sleep," Eben said.

"Everything okay?"

"Yeah. Just—thinking."

Noel crossed to him. Took the coffee mug Eben offered. "Good thinking or bad thinking?"

"Don't know yet."

Noel studied him. "You want to talk about it?"

"Not yet."

"Okay." Noel kissed his cheek. Soft. Easy. Like it was the most natural thing in the world. "Let me know when you're ready."

No pressure. No demands. Just—patience. Trust. Space.

Eben's chest tightened.

"You stayed," Noel said softly.

"Yeah."

"I wasn't sure you would. When I woke up and you weren't there, I thought—" Noel paused. "But you're here. Making coffee. In my kitchen."

"I'm here."

"Good." Noel smiled. "I like you here."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They stood there, drinking coffee in the morning light, and Eben thought: *This is everything I've ever wanted.*

And that was exactly why he was afraid.

---

"What are you thinking?" Noel asked.

"That I'm scared," Eben admitted.

"Of what?"

"This. Us. How much I want this to work."

Noel set down his coffee. Took Eben's hands. "I'm scared too."

"You are?"

"Yeah. I've never wanted someone to stay before. Not like this." Noel paused. "And I'm worried I'm going to mess it up."

"You won't."

"You don't know that."

"I know you," Eben said. "And I trust you."

"Even though you're scared?"

"Especially because I'm scared."

Noel smiled. "That doesn't make sense."

"I know." Eben pulled him closer. "But it's true."

They stood there, holding each other in the kitchen.

He could stay. For Noel. For this. For them.

---

"Three days left," Noel said quietly.

"Until what?"

"Until Christmas. Until the twelve days are over."

Eben's stomach dropped. "Right."

"What happens then?"

"I don't know."

"Do you still want this? After the holidays?"

"Yes," Eben said immediately. "Yes."

"Okay." Noel relaxed slightly. "Okay. Good."

"Did you think I'd change my mind?"

"I don't know. Maybe." Noel looked away. "I wanted to make sure."

Eben turned his face back. Made him look. "I meant what I said. I love you."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Noel kissed him. Soft. Sweet. Trusting.

---

They finished their coffee.

Made breakfast together. Moved around each other in the kitchen like they'd been doing this for years.

Ordinary. Domestic. Real.

And absolutely terrifying.

Because this was everything he'd ever wanted.

Three days left.

And then—

Everything was about to change.

Eben could feel it.

The fear lurking beneath the happiness. The sense that something was coming. That this perfect moment couldn't last.

But he pushed it down.

Focused on Noel, smiling at him over breakfast, ribbon still on his wrist, looking at Eben like he was everything.

His phone buzzed again. Same email.

Eben picked it up. Read the first line: *Regarding your availability for January—*

He looked at Noel. At the kitchen. At the life that was starting to take shape here.

Then he closed the email and set his phone face-down on the counter.

January could wait.

He was here now.

And that was the choice he was making.
