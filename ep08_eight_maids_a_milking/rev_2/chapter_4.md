## Chapter 4: 3 AM Moment

**EBEN**

Eben watched Noel sleep and thought: *I could have this. Every day.*

The thought terrified him.

Noel was curled on his side, still wrapped in Eben's coat, the red ribbon bright against his wrist. His breathing was slow and even. Peaceful. Like he felt safe enough to let go completely.

Eben had never felt safe enough to let go completely.

Not once in his entire life.

But sitting here, in the cold pre-dawn quiet, watching Noel sleep—he wanted to.

He wanted to let go. To stop protecting himself. To believe that this—whatever this was—could last.

The market was done. Finished. Beautiful.

They'd built it together. From disaster to triumph in less than twenty-four hours.

Eben had rebuilt a lot of things in his life. Businesses. Strategies. His own carefully constructed walls.

But he'd never built something *with* someone before.

Not like this.

Not with someone who asked what he needed instead of telling him what to do. Not with someone who looked at him like he mattered. Not with someone who fell asleep in his coat and made it feel like a privilege instead of a burden.

Noel shifted in his sleep. Made a small sound. Settled again.

Eben's chest tightened.

*I could have this every day.*

Wake up beside him. Make coffee in his kitchen. Watch him smile over breakfast. Build things together. Fix things together. Be together.

The future stretched out in front of him, clear and terrifying and perfect.

And that was the problem.

Eben had spent his entire life avoiding exactly this. Attachment. Permanence. The kind of comfort that made you forget to protect yourself.

Because comfort was dangerous.

Comfort made you soft. Made you vulnerable. Made you believe that good things could last.

And in Eben's experience, good things never lasted.

People left. Situations changed. The ground shifted beneath you when you least expected it.

The only way to survive was to stay ready. Stay sharp. Stay unattached.

But Noel was asleep in his coat, ribbon still around his wrist, and Eben didn't want to be anywhere else.

He didn't want to stay sharp.

He wanted to stay *here*.

Dawn came slowly.

Pink light spreading across the sky. The market lights twinkling in the growing brightness. Everything they'd built, illuminated.

Eben sat beside Noel and watched it happen.

Watched the world wake up.

Watched the market come to life.

Watched Noel sleep, peaceful and trusting, and thought: *What if I stopped being afraid?*

What if he let himself want this?

What if he let himself believe it could last?

What if—just this once—he chose comfort over safety?

The questions sat heavy in his chest.

Unanswered.

Unanswerable.

But there, nonetheless.

Noel woke slowly.

Blinked. Focused. Saw Eben sitting beside him.

"Hey," he said, voice rough with sleep.

"Hey."

"Did I—how long was I out?"

"Twenty minutes. Maybe thirty."

"Sorry."

"Don't be." Eben's voice came out softer than he meant it to. "You needed it."

Noel sat up. Looked around. Saw the finished market.

"We did it," he said.

"We did."

"Together."

"Yeah," Eben said. "Together."

The word felt significant. Heavy. Like a promise he wasn't sure he knew how to keep.

But he wanted to.

God, he wanted to.

They sat there, side by side, watching the sun rise over what they'd built.

And Eben thought: *I'm going to try.*

Try to stop being afraid.

Try to believe this could last.

Try to be the person Noel deserved.

Even if it terrified him.

Even if he didn't know how.

Even if every instinct he had was screaming at him to run.

He was going to try.

"Come on," he said quietly. "Let's go home."

Home.

The word felt right.

Felt real.

Felt like something he could have, if he was brave enough to reach for it.

They stood. Walked back together through the empty streets, exhausted and triumphant.

And Eben let himself imagine—just for a moment—what it would be like to do this every day.

To build things with Noel. To watch him sleep. To go home together.

To stay.

The thought still terrified him.

But maybe—just maybe—it was worth being terrified for.
