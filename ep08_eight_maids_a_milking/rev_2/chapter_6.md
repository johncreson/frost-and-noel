## Chapter 6: Home Space

**NOEL**

The coffee finished brewing.

Neither of them moved to get it.

They stood in Noel's living room, facing each other, and the air between them felt electric. Charged. Full of possibility and terror in equal measure.

"I'm not going anywhere," Eben had said.

And Noel had believed him.

But now—standing here, in the aftermath of that confession—Noel didn't know what came next.

"You should sit," Eben said quietly.

"I'm okay standing."

"Noel."

The way Eben said his name—soft, careful, like it mattered—made Noel's knees weak.

"Okay," he said. "Sitting."

They moved to the couch. Sat down. Close but not touching.

"I need you to understand something," Eben said, looking down at his hands. "I'm not good at this. At staying. At—commitment. At believing good things can last."

"I know."

"And I'm going to mess up. I'm going to get scared. I'm going to—" Eben's voice cracked slightly. "I'm going to want to run."

Noel's chest tightened. "Okay."

"But I don't want to run from you."

"Okay."

"I want to try. To stay. To—" Eben looked up. Met Noel's eyes. "To be the person you deserve."

Noel's throat closed. "Eben—"

"I'm not promising I'll be perfect. I'm not promising I won't fuck this up. But I'm promising I'll try."

The words settled between them. Heavy. Real. More than Noel had dared to hope for.

"That's all I'm asking," Noel said quietly. "Just—try. Be here. Be present. That's enough."

"Is it?"

"Yeah." Noel reached out. Took Eben's hand. "It is."

Their fingers laced together. The ribbon on Noel's wrist brushed against Eben's skin.

"I'm scared," Eben admitted.

"Me too."

"You are?"

"Yeah." Noel smiled. "I'm terrified. This is new for me too. Wanting someone to stay. Believing they might actually want to."

"I want to."

"I know."

They sat there, holding hands, and Noel felt something in his chest loosen.

This was real. This was happening.

"I should tell you something," Noel said.

"Okay."

"I'm not easy to be with. I overwork. I don't ask for help. I—" Noel paused. "I have a habit of making myself useful instead of letting myself be wanted."

Eben's grip tightened. "I've noticed."

"And I'm working on it. But it's hard. And I'm going to slip up."

"Noel," Eben interrupted gently. "I know. I see you. All of it. And I'm still here."

Noel's eyes stung. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They sat there, hands clasped. Not perfect. Not easy. Just—honest. Present. Trying.

"So," Noel said. "We're doing this?"

"We're doing this."

"For real?"

"For real."

Noel smiled. "Okay."

"Okay."

The coffee was probably cold by now.

Neither of them cared.

They sat on the couch, close enough to touch, and just—existed. Together.

"I should sleep," Eben said eventually. "We both should."

"Yeah."

"But I don't want to move."

"Me neither."

Eben's thumb traced circles on the back of Noel's hand. Slow. Deliberate. Grounding.

"Tonight," Noel said quietly. "Tomorrow. However long you want."

Eben looked at him. Really looked. And Noel saw everything in that gaze—fear and hope and determination and something that looked dangerously close to love.

And Noel believed him.

---

They moved to the bedroom eventually.

Not for sleep. Not yet.

Just—to be closer. To be together. To make this real.

Noel sat on the edge of the bed. Eben stood in front of him.

"I need you to know something," Noel said. Because he needed to say it. Needed Eben to hear it. "This matters. *You* matter. I'm not asking you to be here because I need someone. I'm asking because I want *you*."

Eben's breath caught.

"I want you," Noel repeated. "Exactly as you are. Scared and guarded and terrible at feelings. I want all of it. I want *you*."

Eben knelt in front of him. Took his face in both hands.

Their foreheads touched.

"Okay," Noel whispered.

"Okay."

And then Eben kissed him.

Slow. Deliberate. Like a promise.

Like a beginning.

Like everything Noel had ever wanted and never thought he'd get to keep.

"I'm here," Eben whispered against his mouth. "I'm right here."

And he was.

And Noel let himself believe it.
