# Chapter 1: Assignment

Eben Frost did not take jobs in small towns.

Small towns had opinions. Small towns had neighbors who brought casseroles and asked about your feelings. Small towns had community events that required enthusiasm and eye contact, both of which Eben had professionally eliminated from his repertoire.

And yet.

His phone sat on the glass dining table of his Chicago apartment, screen lit with an incoming call from a number he didn't recognize. Area code: somewhere pastoral. Somewhere that probably had a town square and aggressive holiday decorations.

He let it ring.

The apartment was exactly the way he preferred it: minimal, efficient, empty. White walls. Gray furniture. A single cactus on the windowsill that required watering once a month and never asked for anything else. The view from the twenty-third floor was all steel and winter sky, the kind of landscape that didn't expect you to feel things about it.

The phone stopped ringing.

Eben returned to his laptop. He had three contracts pending: a corporate restructuring in Denver, an operations audit in Seattle, and a supply chain optimization that would take six weeks in a city cold enough to justify his existing wardrobe.

Sensible work. Clean work. The kind of work where no one asked about his holidays.

His phone rang again.

Same number.

Eben stared at it with the weary resignation of a man who knew, with absolute certainty, that answering would be a mistake.

He answered anyway.

"Mr. Frost! Oh, thank goodness. I was worried I had the wrong number. Or that you were dead. Or that you'd moved to an island without cell service, which frankly seems appealing but very inconvenient for my current crisis."

Eben held the phone slightly away from his ear. "Who is this?"

"Grant Kringle! Mayor of Tinsel Town! You came highly recommended by Margaret Chen at the Hospitality Logistics Consortium—she said you were the best, absolutely the best, and that you could fix anything that wasn't actively on fire. Are things on fire there? I hear sirens sometimes from your direction."

"Those are ambulances."

"Oh, good! Well, not good, but—you know what I mean."

Eben did not, in fact, know what he meant.

"Mr. Kringle—"

"Mayor Kringle. It's a family name. Very festive. Completely coincidental."

"Mayor Kringle. I don't take municipal events. I've made that clear to Margaret."

"Yes, yes, she mentioned that. She also mentioned that you took the Aspen Winter Gala two years ago, and that went splendidly, so I thought perhaps—"

"Aspen was a private foundation event. Not a town."

"Right, but we're barely a town! Technically we're a 'census-designated place,' which I'm told means we're too small to count properly but too stubborn to disappear. Very charming. Low stakes. Nothing complicated."

Eben closed his laptop. "What's the job?"

The mayor's voice shifted, losing some of its manic brightness. "We have a festival. The Twelve Days of Magic. It's our signature event—the only reason tourists know we exist. And our event coordinator, Noel, he's wonderful, absolutely wonderful, but he's doing it alone and..."

A pause. Heavy.

"He won't ask for help," Mayor Kringle said quietly. "He never does. And I'm watching him fall apart, Mr. Frost. I'm watching the best person in this town work himself into the ground because he thinks his job is to hold everything together. And I can't—I won't—let that happen."

Eben looked at his cactus.

"That's not logistics," he said. "That's management."

"It's twelve days. December fourteenth through the twenty-fifth. I need someone to share the operational load. Someone competent, organized, and professional enough that Noel can't argue they don't belong there."

"You're hiring me to manage a person."

"I'm hiring you to run systems. If you happen to notice that a very tired man is breaking himself in half to make everyone else happy, and if you happen to—I don't know—prevent that? Bonus."

Eben should hang up.

He had three perfectly sensible contracts on his laptop. He had a cactus that didn't require emotional maintenance. He had a very specific rule about small towns and the people in them who inevitably wanted connection, warmth, and other things Eben no longer knew how to provide.

"Housing?" Eben heard himself ask.

"Arranged! A lovely rental, walking distance from everything. Heat included. Very cozy."

Eben hated cozy.

"Flight?"

"You can drive it! Eight hours from Chicago, give or take. Very scenic, if you like snow and pine trees."

"Contract terms?"

"Standard consulting rates, which I assume are astronomical, plus a completion bonus if the festival doesn't collapse into a pile of glitter and broken dreams."

Eben pulled up his calendar. December fourteenth was tomorrow.

"I'll arrive tomorrow morning."

"Oh, thank goodness! Mr. Frost, you're a lifesaver. Noel is going to—well, he's probably going to hate you at first, actually. He doesn't like being managed. But he'll come around! He always does."

Eben doubted that.

"Where do I check in?"

"Merryweather Hall. Festival headquarters. Just look for the man who looks like he hasn't slept in three days and is smiling anyway. That's Noel."

Eben wrote the address on a notepad he kept by the phone. "Understood."

"Wonderful! Welcome to Tinsel Town, Mr. Frost! I promise you'll love it."

Eben hung up without responding to that particular lie.

---

He packed in forty-five minutes.

Two suitcases, precisely organized. Charcoal coats. Black boots. Sweaters in neutral tones. A single pair of gloves—leather, butter-soft—that he'd owned for seven years and never replaced.

Everything he owned fit into two bags. This was intentional. If you never accumulated, you never had to leave anything behind.

The cactus would survive. He'd set up an automatic watering system last year, the kind that dripped precisely three tablespoons every ten days. The cactus required nothing, asked for nothing, and thrived on neglect.

Eben understood the cactus.

He stood at the window one last time, watching Chicago glitter coldly beneath a December moon. Eight years in this city. Four apartments, each more efficient than the last. No plants that needed sunlight. No art on the walls. No evidence, really, that anyone lived here at all.

*Clean entry, clean exit.*

That was the rule. That was the only rule that kept him functional.

He'd learned it the hard way—the only way anyone learned anything that mattered. Attachment was a structural weakness. It destabilized systems. It made you build something beautiful and then watch it collapse when someone decided they didn't want to be part of it anymore.

Better to never build at all.

His phone buzzed.

**Margaret Chen:** *Grant Kringle just called me crying.*

**Eben:** *I said yes.*

**Margaret:** *I know. He said, and I quote, "The Ice King is coming to save Christmas."*

Eben did not dignify that with a response.

**Margaret:** *You'll be fine. Tinsel Town is aggressively charming. Just don't let them adopt you.*

**Eben:** *Unlikely.*

**Margaret:** *That's what the last guy said. He married a florist.*

Eben put the phone in his pocket.

The drive would take eight hours. He could make it by morning if he left now, stopped once for gas, and avoided any weather-related delays. The car was already packed. The apartment was already closed.

He left without looking back.

There was nothing to look back at.

# Chapter 2: The Drive

The highway unspooled through the dark like a thread of frozen logic.

Eben drove the way he did everything: controlled, steady, precise. Cruise control set to exactly seven miles above the speed limit—efficient without being reckless. Hands at ten and two. Heater on low. No music, because music led to feelings, and feelings led to distraction, and distraction led to ice patches and existential regret.

The snow began somewhere past the Indiana border.

Light at first, just a dusting that caught the headlights and scattered into nothing. Then heavier, a veil of white that blurred the edges of the road and made the trees appear ghostly and over-familiar, like figures in a recurring dream.

Eben did not believe in dreams.

He believed in contingency plans.

He'd packed tire chains (unnecessary, but thorough). A thermal blanket. An emergency kit with exactly twelve protein bars and a first-aid kit that had never been opened. His trunk held enough supplies to survive three days of highway isolation, which was both paranoid and statistically justified.

The radio crackled with static. He'd accidentally tapped the dial while reaching for his coffee, and now a voice was filtering through—some local station playing what sounded like a choir of children singing "Silent Night" with more enthusiasm than talent.

He turned it off.

Silence returned. The engine hummed. The snow fell.

Somewhere around mile marker 247, his thoughts began to drift.

*The best person in this town is working himself into the ground.*

He didn't know why the mayor's words kept replaying. He didn't know this Noel Merrick. He had a file—a slim one, mostly logistics—that told him Noel was twenty-seven, had a background in event management, and had been running Tinsel Town's festival operations for five years.

Five years.

In a small town.

That was either dedication or the kind of inertia that came from never believing you could leave.

*He won't ask for help. He never does.*

Eben's hands tightened on the wheel.

He'd known people like that. Had been people like that, once, before he'd learned that helping was just another word for getting trapped.

The miles passed.

He stopped once, at a gas station that looked like it had been open since 1974 and hadn't updated since. The attendant—a woman in her sixties with a cigarette tucked behind her ear—looked at his charcoal coat and leather gloves and raised an eyebrow.

"City boy?"

"Chicago."

"Thought so. Where you headed?"

"Tinsel Town."

She laughed. It was not a kind laugh. "Good luck with that. They're... enthusiastic."

"I've been warned."

"No, you haven't." She handed him his receipt. "Merry Christmas."

Eben got back in the car.

---

The first sign appeared around 3 AM.

**TINSEL TOWN: 47 MILES  
WHERE EVERY DAY IS CHRISTMAS!**

It was shaped like a candy cane. There were twinkle lights, despite the fact that the sign was in the middle of nowhere and no one would see them except passing truckers and the occasional sleep-deprived logistics consultant who had made a series of questionable life choices.

Eben stared at it for a full five seconds.

Then he kept driving.

The signs continued.

**TINSEL TOWN: 32 MILES  
HOME OF THE TWELVE DAYS OF MAGIC!**

**TINSEL TOWN: 18 MILES  
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU!**

That one had a snowman waving. Animatronic, probably, though it wasn't moving. Either the motor had frozen or it was designed to look ominous, which seemed on-brand for a town that named itself after craft supplies.

**TINSEL TOWN: 5 MILES  
HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR SOME MAGIC!**

Eben was not ready for magic.

He was ready for a hotel bed, eight hours of sleep, and the grim satisfaction of walking into a logistical disaster and imposing order through sheer competence.

That was the job. That was always the job.

*Fix the systems. Ignore the people. Leave before anyone gets attached.*

The town emerged from the snow like a hallucination.

One moment, there was nothing but fields and pines. The next, there were streetlights strung with lights, sidewalks lined with wreaths, and a main street that looked like a Christmas catalog had exploded on top of an actual functioning municipality.

Eben slowed the car.

Every building was decorated. Every single one. The hardware store had a wreath the size of a sedan. The café had string lights dripping from every available surface. There was a candle burning in a window, and another, and another—dozens of them, flickering in unison like the town had scheduled its coziness.

It was 4:47 AM. Who was awake at 4:47 AM to light candles?

Eben pulled over to check the address for his rental. One block off main street. He could walk to Merryweather Hall in three minutes.

But first—

His eyes caught movement.

Across the town square, past a massive unlit tree that dominated the center of the space, a building glowed. Merryweather Hall, according to his notes. The festival headquarters.

The lights were on.

At 4:47 AM.

# Chapter 3: First Impression

Eben should go to the rental.

He should unpack, sleep, and arrive at Merryweather Hall at a professional hour—8 AM, perhaps, after a shower and the kind of breakfast that didn't come from gas station vending machines.

He should not walk across the frosted town square in the pre-dawn dark to peer through the windows of a building he wasn't supposed to enter until tomorrow.

Eben walked across the square anyway.

The snow crunched under his boots. The cold was sharper here than in Chicago—cleaner, somehow, without the diesel undertone of the city. The air smelled of pine and wood smoke and something sweet, possibly cinnamon, possibly the town's aggressive commitment to sensory manipulation.

Merryweather Hall was larger than he'd expected. Stone foundation, timber beams, the kind of architecture that looked like it had been here since the town was founded and would remain long after everyone currently living was gone.

The windows glowed gold.

Eben stopped at the edge of the square, half-hidden in the shadow of a lamppost, and looked.

There was a man inside.

He was moving between tables, adjusting things—banners, maybe, or decorations. He moved with the frantic efficiency of someone who had been working for hours without noticing the time. 

Even from here, from thirty feet away through glass, Eben could see the exhaustion. It was in the slope of his shoulders. The slight tremor when he lifted a box. The way he paused, sometimes, and pressed a hand to his forehead like he was trying to physically hold his thoughts together.

And then—

The man smiled.

Not at anyone. There was no one else in the hall. He smiled at nothing, at the empty room, at a job that was clearly crushing him.

It was the saddest smile Eben had ever seen.

He watched for exactly four seconds longer than was professional.

The man reached for another box. Nearly dropped it. Caught it with a laugh that Eben could see but not hear—a silent, shaking thing that could have been amusement or could have been the sound of someone finally reaching the edge.

*That's Noel Merrick,* Eben thought. *That's the man I'm supposed to help.*

He'd expected competence. He'd expected the kind of harried efficiency that came with running an event alone.

He hadn't expected this.

He hadn't expected someone who smiled at nothing because they'd forgotten there was any other way to hold themselves together. Someone who worked at 4:47 AM because stopping meant admitting they needed something they couldn't name.

Eben knew that posture.

He'd lived in that posture for years before he'd learned to replace it with emptiness.

The man—Noel—bent to pick up something that had fallen. From this angle, Eben could see his face more clearly. Warm features. Expressive eyes, even in exhaustion. The kind of face that was designed for openness and was currently running a master class in concealment.

Noel straightened, stretched his back, and looked toward the window.

Eben stepped back into the shadow before their eyes could meet.

He stood there, breath fogging in the cold, watching the golden light spill across the snow.

*Tomorrow*, he told himself. *Tomorrow, you walk in there and fix the festival. You impose systems. You organize chaos. You do not—under any circumstances—get involved with the man holding it together.*

That wasn't the job.

*Go to the rental. Sleep. Begin in the morning.*

He walked away.

The snow kept falling, covering his footprints before they had time to settle.

---

The rental was exactly as promised: small, clean, and aggressively cozy.

Someone had put a wreath on the door. There was a basket of muffins on the counter with a card that read *Welcome to Tinsel Town! May your stay be merry and bright!* The bed had approximately seventeen decorative pillows, all of which Eben removed and stacked in the corner like festive prisoners.

He didn't unpack.

He sat on the edge of the bed—stripped to just the essentials—and looked at his hands.

Still wearing the gloves.

He'd been wearing them for eight hours. Driving gloves, technically, butter-soft leather that absorbed the cold without becoming stiff. He wore gloves the way other people wore armor: constantly, deliberately, a barrier between himself and the world.

He took them off now. Slowly. One finger at a time.

His hands were cold underneath.

They were always cold.

He flexed his fingers, watching the tendons move, the pale skin that rarely saw direct light. Functional hands. Competent hands. Hands that fixed systems and signed contracts and never touched anyone who might matter.

*He won't ask for help. He never does.*

The mayor's words again. Persistent. Unwelcome.

Eben looked toward the window. From here, he could see the faint glow of Merryweather Hall across the square. The lights were still on.

4:52 AM now.

Noel Merrick was still in there, still working, still smiling at nobody because he didn't know how to stop.

*That's not the job,* Eben reminded himself. *The job is logistics. The job is systems. The job is twelve days and a clean exit.*

He pulled the blanket over himself without changing clothes.

The ceiling was wood-paneled, warm and old. Someone had painted tiny stars in one corner, barely visible in the dark.

*Tomorrow,* he thought. *Tomorrow, you fix the festival.*

*Just the festival.*

*Not the man.*

He closed his eyes.

Outside, the snow kept falling on Tinsel Town.

And somewhere across the square, a light stayed on all night.
