## BLURBS

### Blurb A: BookFunnel/Amazon (Short, Punchy)

Eben Frost doesn't do small towns.

He does clean contracts, empty apartments, and the kind of efficiency that keeps feelings at arm's length. So when a panicked mayor hires him to save a twelve-day Christmas festival in a town called *Tinsel*, he should say no.

He doesn't.

Because somewhere in that town, there's an event coordinator who won't ask for help. Who's been awake for three days. Who smiles like it's the only thing keeping him upright.

Eben tells himself this is just logistics.

He tells himself the drive through the snow, the lights on the hall at 5 AM, the man visible through the window—none of it means anything.

He tells himself a lot of things.

Then he pushes open the door.

*The Night Before is a free prequel to the Frost & Noel series. For the full story, start with Episode 1: Partridge in a Panic.*

### Blurb B: Shorter (Newsletter/Landing Page)

He wasn't supposed to care.

One call. One contract. Twelve days in a town that thinks Christmas is a personality trait.

Eben Frost said yes anyway.

Now he's standing outside Merryweather Hall at 5:40 AM, watching a man hold a festival together with nothing but spite and a smile.

This is just logistics.

This is definitely just logistics.

**The door opens. What happens next changes everything.**

*Continue with Episode 1: Partridge in a Panic.*
