### TINSEL TOWN WELCOME PACKET

Welcome to Tinsel Town. Where the cocoa is hot, the sidewalks are suspiciously free of ice, and the holiday committee has a clipboard for everyone.

**Don't Miss:**
- **The Garland Cup:** order the peppermint mocha and pretend it's not life-changing.
- **Candle & Crumb Bakery:** pastries that count as emotional support.
- **Everhart Crafts:** enter at your own risk. Glitter is forever.
- **Merryweather Hall:** where plans are made and sanity goes to die.

**Local Tip:**
If you see **Eben Frost**, offer him coffee, not conversation.
If you see **Noel Merrick**, offer him a chair. He won't take it, but it's nice to try.

### The Chair

Noel found the chair outside his office like it had been placed there by an exhausted angel.

Plain wood. Sturdy. No ribbon. No sparkle. No note.

Just a chair, positioned in the exact spot Noel always paced while pretending he wasn't tired.

He stared at it for a full five seconds before he heard footsteps.

Eben appeared at the end of the hall, coat open, scarf half off, looking like winter had learned how to walk indoors without melting.

Noel crossed his arms. "Did you put that there?"

Eben's gaze slid to the chair, then back. "Yes."

Noel lifted his brows. "Why?"

Eben's voice stayed even, like this was a logistics problem with a simple solution. "You haven't sat down in three hours."

Noel scoffed. "I sit."

Eben looked at him.

Noel's mouth snapped shut.

Eben stepped closer, stopping at a polite distance that somehow felt less polite than it should. "Sit."

Noel's pulse tripped. It wasn't the word. It was the certainty under it, the quiet assumption that Noel's body mattered too.

Noel swallowed. "You can't order me around."

Eben's gaze dipped briefly, then returned. "I can. You just don't like admitting you want to listen."

Noel's face went warm. "That's not…"

Eben's voice softened. Barely. "Noel."

The way Eben said it made Noel's spine go still.

Noel exhaled, defeated by a chair and a man who looked like he'd never been defeated by anything in his life. He sat.

The chair held him. The hallway quieted. His shoulders dropped like they'd been waiting for permission.

Eben watched him for a second longer than necessary.

Then Eben reached out, adjusted Noel's collar with two careful fingers, and let his hand fall away like he hadn't just touched Noel like he meant it.

Noel's throat tightened. "This is ridiculous."

Eben's mouth tipped, almost. "Yes."

Noel stared up at him. "Are you going to be like this all season?"

Eben's eyes warmed in a way that should've been illegal in a public building. "If you let me."

Noel's breath caught.

Eben stepped back, giving Noel space like it was a gift. "Five minutes," Eben said. "Then we fix your schedule. Properly."

Noel should've argued.

Instead, he sat there, warm and furious and weirdly safe, thinking about how a chair had become the most intimate thing anyone had given him in months.

And how Eben Frost had done it like it was nothing.
