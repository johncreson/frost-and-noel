## Draft Text

### Scene 1: The First Ribbon (Noel POV)

Noel Merrick had wrapped so many gift baskets he could tie a bow in his sleep.

He had, in fact, tied three bows in his sleep last year and woken up to thin red ribbon stuck to his cheek like evidence.

Tonight, he was awake. Wide awake. The kind of awake that came from too much cocoa and not enough help.

Merryweather Hall looked like a craft store exploded inside it. Evergreen garlands drooped from the railings. Twinkle lights blinked in lazy waves. A thousand tiny pine needles glittered on the floor like the town's version of confetti.

Noel crouched beside a half-finished basket and breathed out slow. "Okay," he whispered, as if the basket were a frightened animal. "You're going to be charming. You're going to be festive. And you are going to stop fighting me."

The basket did not cooperate.

A roll of ribbon slid off the table, bounced once, and sailed across the room.

Noel watched it go with the weary resignation of a man who had given up arguing with gravity.

He started after it.

The hall door opened.

Cold air swept in, sharp and clean, carrying snow and the faintest bite of cedar. A man stepped inside like he owned the concept of winter.

Tall. Broad-shouldered. Dark coat. Dark hair. Dark expression.

Noel straightened, ribbon forgotten. "We're closed."

The man's gaze flicked over the chaos, then back to Noel. Calm. Unimpressed. Assessing. "I can see that."

Noel blinked. "Excuse me?"

The man reached up and removed his gloves one finger at a time, as if even that required discipline. "I'm looking for Noel Merrick."

Noel's heart did that annoying little thing it did when someone said his full name like it mattered. "You found him."

"I'm Eben Frost."

The way he said it made it sound less like a name and more like a weather warning.

Noel forced a smile. "Great. And what can I do for you, Mr. Frost?"

Eben's attention dropped briefly to Noel's hands. The ribbon burn on one finger. The red marks on his palms. The way he was holding himself like he was bracing for impact.

Then Eben looked back up. His eyes were pale and steady.

"Mayor Kringle hired me," Eben said.

Noel's smile tightened. "Of course he did."

"He said you needed help."

Noel laughed, a little too sharp. "Mayor Kringle says a lot of things."

Eben didn't move. Didn't blink. Didn't soften.

"Do you need help?"

Noel opened his mouth.

Two sensible answers fought for dominance.

*No, I'm fine. I'm always fine.*

And the other one, quieter. Truer.

*Yes. Please.*

Noel swallowed. "I'm handling it."

Eben's gaze slid to the crooked garland, the half-strung lights, the baskets leaning like exhausted soldiers.

"That's one word for it," Eben said.

Noel's cheeks warmed. "I didn't invite you here to judge my baskets."

"I'm not judging," Eben replied. "I'm evaluating."

Noel didn't like how that made his pulse jump.

"Evaluating what?"

Eben's eyes held his.

"Whether you're going to burn out before Christmas."

Noel stared.

That was… not what people usually said.

Noel lifted his chin anyway. "I'm not going to burn out."

Eben's gaze didn't waver.

"That's not an answer."

Noel let out a breath he hadn't meant to show. "Are you always like this?"

"Yes."

At least he was honest.

Noel gestured at the chaos. "Well. If you're here, you might as well make yourself useful."

Eben stepped forward, calm as a metronome. "That's the plan."

Noel pointed at the nearest basket. "Start with that. If you can tie a bow, you can stay."

Eben picked up the ribbon.

His fingers were strong and careful. He looped it once, twice, then pulled it tight with a neat efficiency that made Noel's stomach flip for no good reason.

Eben lifted the finished bow and held it out. "Like this?"

Noel stared at the ribbon. Then up at Eben.

"Yeah," Noel managed. "Like that."

Eben's voice dropped, just a fraction. "Good."

Noel's breath caught.

It was a single word.

But it landed like a hand at the small of his back.
