# Chapter 1: Assignment

Eben Frost did not take jobs in small towns.

Small towns had opinions. Small towns had neighbors who brought casseroles and asked about your feelings. Small towns had community events that required enthusiasm and eye contact, both of which Eben had professionally eliminated from his repertoire.

And yet.

His phone sat on the glass dining table of his Chicago apartment, screen lit with an incoming call from a number he didn't recognize. Area code: somewhere pastoral.

He let it ring.

The apartment was exactly the way he preferred it: minimal, efficient, empty. White walls. Gray furniture. A single cactus on the windowsill that required watering once a month and never asked for anything else.

The phone stopped ringing.

Then rang again.

Eben answered.

"Mr. Frost! Oh, thank goodness. I was worried I had the wrong number. Or that you were dead. Or that you'd moved to an island without cell service, which frankly seems appealing but very inconvenient for my current crisis."

Eben held the phone slightly away from his ear. "Who is this?"

"Grant Kringle! Mayor of Tinsel Town! You came highly recommended—Margaret Chen said you were the best, absolutely the best, and that you could fix anything that wasn't actively on fire."

"Mr. Kringle—"

"Mayor Kringle. It's a family name. Very festive."

"I don't take municipal events."

"Yes, yes, she mentioned that. But we're barely a town! Technically a 'census-designated place.' Very charming. Low stakes."

Eben closed his laptop. "What's the job?"

The mayor's voice shifted, losing its manic brightness. "We have a festival. The Twelve Days of Magic. Our signature event. And our event coordinator—Noel—he's wonderful, but he's doing it alone and..."

A pause.

"He won't ask for help," Mayor Kringle said quietly. "He never does. And I'm watching him work himself into the ground because he thinks his job is to hold everything together. I can't let that happen."

Eben looked at his cactus.

"That's management. Not logistics."

"It's twelve days. December fourteenth through the twenty-fifth. I need someone competent enough that Noel can't argue they don't belong there."

"You're hiring me to manage a person."

"I'm hiring you to run systems. If you happen to notice that a very tired man is breaking himself in half, and if you happen to prevent that?" A breath. "Bonus."

Eben should hang up.

He had sensible contracts pending. He had a cactus that didn't require emotional maintenance. He had a very specific rule about small towns and the people in them who inevitably wanted connection.

"Housing?"

"Arranged! Walking distance from everything."

"Contract terms?"

"Standard rates, plus a completion bonus if the festival doesn't collapse into glitter and broken dreams."

December fourteenth was tomorrow.

"I'll arrive in the morning."

"Oh, thank goodness! Noel is probably going to hate you at first—he doesn't like being managed. But he'll come around!"

Eben doubted that.

"Where do I check in?"

"Merryweather Hall. Just look for the man who looks like he hasn't slept in three days and is smiling anyway."

Eben hung up.

He packed in forty-five minutes.

Two suitcases. Charcoal coats. Black boots. A single pair of gloves—leather, butter-soft—that he'd owned for seven years.

Everything he owned fit into two bags. If you never accumulated, you never had to leave anything behind.

He stood at the window, watching Chicago glitter beneath a December moon.

*Clean entry, clean exit.*

That was the rule. Attachment was a structural weakness. Better to never build at all.

The drive would take eight hours. He could make it by morning.

He left without looking back.

There was nothing to look back at.

# Chapter 2: The Drive

The highway unspooled through the dark like frozen logic.

Eben drove the way he did everything: controlled, steady, precise. Cruise control at seven above the limit. Hands at ten and two. No music.

The snow began past the Indiana border. Light at first. Then heavier, a veil of white that blurred the edges of the road.

Somewhere around mile marker 247, his thoughts drifted.

*The best person in this town is working himself into the ground.*

He didn't know why the mayor's words kept replaying. He didn't know Noel Merrick. The file was slim—twenty-seven, event management background, five years running the festival.

Five years. In a small town.

*He won't ask for help. He never does.*

Eben's hands tightened on the wheel.

He'd known people like that. Had been people like that, once.

The first sign appeared around 3 AM.

**TINSEL TOWN: 47 MILES  
WHERE EVERY DAY IS CHRISTMAS!**

Shaped like a candy cane. Twinkle lights despite no audience.

Eben stared at it for a full five seconds.

Then kept driving.

**TINSEL TOWN: 18 MILES  
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU!**

That one had a snowman. Either the motor had frozen or it was designed to look ominous.

The town emerged from the snow like a hallucination.

Every building was decorated. Every single one. The hardware store had a wreath the size of a sedan. Candles burned in windows—dozens of them, flickering in unison like the town had scheduled its coziness.

He parked at the rental just before 5 AM. Slept for ninety minutes. Showered. Put on a fresh coat.

By 5:40 AM, he was walking across Evergreen Square toward Merryweather Hall.

# Chapter 3: The Door

The lights were still on.

Through the tall windows, Eben could see movement. Shadows shifting. Someone still working, still running, still holding everything together by sheer stubborn refusal to stop.

He adjusted his clipboard.

He adjusted his gloves.

He did not adjust the strange tightness in his chest, because that wasn't a thing that could be fixed with logistics.

*Just look for the man who looks like he hasn't slept in three days and is smiling anyway.*

Eben stopped at the main doors.

Through the glass, he could see the chaos. Vendors gesturing. Boxes stacked in wrong places. A man in what appeared to be a cape made entirely of silver tinsel, shouting something about ribbon. A dog investigating a buffet table.

And in the center of it all—

The event coordinator.

Noel Merrick was explaining something with his hands, smiling like his life depended on it, and he looked exactly the way the mayor had described.

Three days without sleep. And smiling anyway.

He was the eye of the storm. And he was beautiful in the way that exhausted, competent people were beautiful—fully lit, burning through fuel he didn't have.

Eben watched for exactly four seconds.

Then five.

Then six.

*That's not the job,* he told himself. *The job is systems. The job is twelve days and a clean exit.*

His hand was on the door.

The cold metal bit through his gloves.

Somewhere inside, Noel Merrick was holding everything together for a town that didn't know how close he was to breaking.

Eben pushed the door open.
