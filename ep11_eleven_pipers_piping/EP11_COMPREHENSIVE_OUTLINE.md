## Chapter 1: Christmas Eve Morning
**POV:** NOEL

2. The bed is still wrong without Eben
3. Internal: *Last day of the festival. Last excuse.*
4. Remembers the unfinished sentence from EP7: "I need—"
5. He never finished it. The interruption. The fear.
6. Decision crystallizes: *Today. I finish the sentence. Whatever happens.*
7. Gets ready with intention, not performance
8. The ribbon is still on his wrist—he doesn't take it off

### Exit Shift
He's going to show up. Not to be useful. To be honest.

10. Noel: stunned. "What?"
11. Eben: "I closed the exit. Before I knew if you'd want me."

9. "Because I'm better when you stay."

## Chapter 7: Repair Intimacy
**POV:** BOTH (alternating or close third)
**Location:** Noel's apartment
**Word Target:** 2,500-3,000

REPAIR SEX. Intimacy as accountability and choice.

### Beat-by-Beat
1. Back at Noel's—intentional, not frantic
2. The first kiss is careful. Rebuilding.
3. Then real. Deep.
4. Explicit emotional language throughout:
   - "Tell me you're staying."
   - "I'm staying."
   - "Say my name."
   - "Noel."
5. Words during: "I'm sorry." "I know." "I'm here." "I know."
6. More verbal than any scene before—they're communicating
7. The apology woven through: "I'm sorry I said—" / "I've got you."
8. Tender, not frantic
9. Eye contact maintained
10. Completion = relief + connection
11. Extended aftercare: holding, breathing, being present
12. "You're staying" as through-line

### Heat Notes

- Aftercare IS the scene

### Exit Shift
They're back. Stronger.

Tomorrow is Christmas. They're going to do it together.

## Continuity Flags

- [ ] "I need you" = callback to EP7's unfinished sentence
- [ ] "I'm choosing you" = Eben's character arc turns
- [ ] January contract reveal = EP10's forward lock pays off
- [ ] "That okay counts" = callback to Wes/Sam
- [ ] Repair sex = full of words (opposite of rupture silence)
- [ ] "I stay" = answers the question from the start
