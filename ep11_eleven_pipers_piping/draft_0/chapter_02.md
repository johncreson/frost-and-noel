# Chapter 2
## POV: Dual (Noel → Eben)

### POV: NOEL

The Garland Cup smelled like cinnamon and desperation.

Noel pushed through the door, the bell chiming overhead, and immediately regretted every decision that had led him here. The café was packed—last-minute shoppers, festival volunteers, tourists who'd decided that Christmas Eve in a small town was exactly the kind of wholesome experience they needed to Instagram. The noise hit him like a wall: laughter, conversation, the hiss of the espresso machine, all of it blending into a cacophony that made his skull ache.

He should have stayed home.

"You look like roadkill."

Noel turned. Wes stood behind the counter, arms crossed, expression somewhere between concern and exasperation. "Thanks," Noel said flatly. "Really needed that this morning."

"I'm serious." Wes leaned forward, lowering his voice just enough that the customers wouldn't hear. "You look like you haven't slept in a week. Which, knowing you, you probably haven't."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You're miserable. And before you try to deflect—" Wes held up a hand, cutting off Noel's automatic protest. "—I'm not letting you. Not today."

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it. Tried again. "Wes—"

"He's miserable too, you know." Wes's voice was gentler now, but no less direct. "Eben. He looks like someone kicked his dog. Except he doesn't have a dog, so I'm pretty sure the thing he's mourning is you."

The words landed like a punch to the sternum. Noel swallowed hard, his throat suddenly tight. "I don't—"

"Stop being idiots," Wes said, not unkindly. "Both of you. Whatever happened, whatever got said—fix it. It's Christmas Eve. You don't get to spend it like this."

"It's not that simple."

"It never is." Wes straightened, grabbing a to-go cup and scribbling something on it. "But you know what's worse than trying and failing? Not trying at all. And I've watched you not try for days now, and I'm done with it."

He shoved the cup across the counter. Noel took it automatically, glancing down at the label: *Noel—Stop Being Tragic*.

Despite everything, a laugh bubbled up in his chest. "Subtle."

"I don't do subtle. I do effective." Wes's expression softened just a fraction. "Talk to him, Noel. Please. The whole town is rooting for you two, and honestly, watching you both mope around is exhausting."

Noel stared at the cup in his hands, the warmth seeping into his palms. "What if he doesn't want to?"

"Then you'll know," Wes said simply. "But I don't think that's the problem."

### POV: EBEN

Eben was halfway through his third lap around the town square when Sam appeared out of nowhere and blocked his path.

"You look like you made a mistake," Sam said without preamble. "Fix it."

Eben stopped short, breath misting in the cold air. "Excuse me?"

"You heard me." Sam crossed his arms, the gesture so reminiscent of Wes that Eben would have laughed if he weren't so tired. "Whatever you did—and I'm guessing it was something stupid, because you've got that look—fix it."

"I'm trying," Eben said, the words coming out sharper than he intended. "It's not—"

"Try harder." Sam's voice was firm but not unkind. "It's Christmas Eve, Frost. You don't get to spend it like this. And more importantly, Noel doesn't deserve to spend it like this."

The use of his last name—formal, pointed—made something twist in Eben's chest. "I know."

"Do you?" Sam stepped closer, his expression serious. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're doing that thing you do. The thing where you decide something's impossible before you even try."

Eben wanted to argue. Wanted to say that Sam didn't understand, that it was more complicated than that, that he'd already tried and failed and made everything worse. But the words stuck in his throat, because Sam was right.

He was always right.

"What if I already ruined it?" Eben asked quietly.

"Then you apologize," Sam said, like it was the simplest thing in the world. "You apologize, and you mean it, and you let him decide what happens next. But you don't get to make that decision for him. That's not fair, and you know it."

Eben closed his eyes, the cold air burning in his lungs. "I don't know if I can—"

"You can." Sam's hand landed on his shoulder, solid and grounding. "And you will. Because the alternative is spending the rest of your life wondering what would have happened if you'd been brave enough to try."

### POV: NOEL

Noel was still standing in the Garland Cup, staring at his coffee cup, when Hugh appeared at his elbow.

"Stop being tragic," Hugh said mildly, echoing the label on Noel's cup. "It doesn't suit you."

Noel blinked at him. "Did Wes put you up to this?"

"No one puts me up to anything. I'm a free agent." Hugh smiled, the expression warm and knowing. "But I am going to tell you the same thing I told Eben ten minutes ago: talk to each other. You're both miserable. The whole town knows it. And frankly, we're all exhausted from watching you two dance around each other."

"You talked to Eben?"

"I did. And he looked about as wrecked as you do." Hugh's smile faded into something more serious. "Whatever happened between you two, it's not unsalvageable. But it will be if you keep avoiding it."

Noel's chest felt too tight. "What if he doesn't want to fix it?"

"Then you'll know," Hugh said, the same words Wes had used. "But I don't think that's the problem. I think you're both scared. And that's okay. Being scared is human. But letting fear make your decisions for you? That's just sad."

He clapped Noel on the shoulder, gentle but firm, and walked away before Noel could respond.

Noel stood there, surrounded by the noise and warmth of the café, and thought about what it meant to be brave.

### POV: EBEN

Eben walked into Merryweather Hall with a plan.

The plan was simple: find Noel. Talk to him. Apologize. Try to fix what he'd broken.

The plan did not account for the sheer chaos of Christmas Eve setup, or the fact that Noel was apparently everywhere and nowhere all at once, directing volunteers and adjusting decorations and moving through the space like he was trying to outrun his own thoughts.

Eben watched him for a moment, standing in the doorway, and felt something crack open in his chest.

He'd done this. He'd made Noel look like that—exhausted, guarded, like he was holding himself together through sheer force of will.

Sam was right. Hugh was right. Hell, even Wes was right.

Eben had to try.

He crossed the hall, weaving through volunteers and tables and garlands, until he was close enough to speak. "Noel."

Noel turned, and for a moment, his expression was unguarded—surprise, hope, fear, all flickering across his face before he locked it down. "Eben."

"Can we talk?"

The question hung between them, fragile and weighted.

Noel's jaw tightened. "About what?"

"About what I said." Eben forced himself to hold Noel's gaze, even though every instinct screamed at him to look away. "About what I meant."

Silence. Noel didn't move, didn't speak, just waited.

Eben swallowed hard. "I panicked."

"You said it was never supposed to last."

The words were quiet, but they hit like a slap. Eben flinched. "I lied."

The admission hung in the air between them. Noel's expression shifted—not forgiveness, not yet, but something softer. Listening.

"Not here," Noel said finally, his voice low. "Too many people."

Eben nodded. "Okay."

Noel glanced around, then jerked his head toward the back hallway. "Come on."

They found a storage room—small, cluttered, lit by a single overhead bulb. The door clicked shut behind them, and suddenly the noise of the hall was gone, replaced by a silence that felt too loud.

Noel leaned against the wall, arms crossed, waiting.

Eben took a breath.

"I need to explain," he said.

"Then explain."

And so he did.
