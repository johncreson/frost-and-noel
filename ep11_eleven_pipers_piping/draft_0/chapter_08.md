# Chapter 8
## POV: Dual (Noel leads)

### POV: NOEL

Noel woke on Christmas morning to snow falling outside the window and Eben's arm around him.

For a moment, he just lay there, watching the flakes drift past the glass, feeling the steady rise and fall of Eben's breathing against his back. The world was quiet—that particular hush that came with fresh snowfall, like the whole town was holding its breath.

It was Christmas. The festival was over. And Eben was still here.

Noel felt something warm and bright unfurl in his chest, something that felt dangerously close to hope.

"You're awake," Eben murmured, his voice rough with sleep.

"So are you," Noel said, smiling.

"Hard to sleep when you're thinking so loud." Eben's arm tightened around him, pulling him closer. "What's going on in that head of yours?"

"Just... processing." Noel turned in Eben's arms so they were face to face. "The festival's over."

"It is."

"Tomorrow is the last day," Noel said, echoing the outline's beat. "Of the twelve days, I mean. And then—"

"And then life goes back to normal," Eben finished. "Whatever that means."

Noel bit his lip, considering. "What does that look like? For us, I mean. What happens after?"

Eben was quiet for a moment, his hand coming up to cup Noel's face. His thumb brushed over Noel's cheekbone, gentle and grounding.

"I stay," Eben said simply.

The words landed like a promise. Noel's breath caught. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." Eben's expression was soft, open, more vulnerable than Noel had ever seen it. "I stay. I figure out what it looks like to build a life here. With you. If you want that."

"I want that," Noel said immediately. "I want that so much."

"Good." Eben leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Noel's forehead. "Because I'm not going anywhere."

They lay there for a while, just holding each other, watching the snow fall outside. Noel felt something settle in his chest—not the anxious, desperate need to hold on tight, but something calmer. More certain.

This was real. This was happening. And for the first time in a long time, Noel wasn't scared of what came next.

### POV: EBEN

"What do you want to do today?" Eben asked eventually, his fingers tracing idle patterns on Noel's shoulder.

"Honestly?" Noel laughed, the sound soft and a little embarrassed. "Nothing. I want to stay in bed with you and pretend the outside world doesn't exist."

"That sounds perfect," Eben said, and meant it.

They did exactly that. Stayed in bed, talking about nothing important—favorite movies, childhood Christmases, the ridiculous number of pipers who'd shown up for yesterday's performance. Normal things. Easy things.

It felt like coming home.

Eventually, hunger drove them out of bed and into the kitchen, where they made breakfast together—or rather, Noel made breakfast while Eben provided commentary and stole bites of pancake batter when Noel wasn't looking.

"You're impossible," Noel said, swatting his hand away.

"You love it," Eben countered.

"I love you," Noel corrected, and Eben's heart did something complicated in his chest.

"I love you too," Eben said, pulling Noel into a kiss that tasted like maple syrup and promise.

They ate breakfast at the small kitchen table, knees bumping underneath, and Eben thought about how many mornings he wanted like this. How many mornings he could have, if he was brave enough to keep choosing it.

"What are you thinking about?" Noel asked, catching him staring.

"Just... this," Eben said honestly. "How much I want it."

Noel's smile was soft, private. "You have it. You have me."

"I know." Eben reached across the table, taking Noel's hand. "I'm still getting used to believing it."

"We have time," Noel said. "All the time in the world."

### POV: NOEL

Later, they bundled up and went for a walk through Frostwick.

The town was quiet on Christmas morning, most people still inside with their families, but there was something magical about it—the fresh snow, the decorated storefronts, the way the whole place looked like a postcard.

They walked hand in hand, not talking much, just being together. Noel felt lighter than he had in weeks, like some weight he'd been carrying had finally been lifted.

"Thank you," Eben said suddenly.

Noel looked at him, surprised. "For what?"

"For giving me another chance." Eben's expression was serious, his eyes bright. "For being brave enough to finish the sentence. For letting me stay."

"You don't have to thank me for that," Noel said softly. "I wanted you to stay. I've always wanted you to stay."

"I know." Eben stopped walking, turning to face Noel fully. "But I'm thanking you anyway. Because you could have told me to leave. You could have decided I wasn't worth the risk. And you didn't."

Noel's throat went tight. "You're worth it," he said. "You're worth the risk. You're worth everything."

Eben kissed him, right there in the middle of Main Street, and Noel kissed him back like it was the most natural thing in the world.

When they pulled apart, both smiling, Noel saw Mrs. Henderson watching from across the street, a knowing look on her face. He waved, and she waved back, her expression fond.

"The whole town knows," Noel said, half-amused, half-mortified.

"Let them know," Eben said, taking his hand again. "I'm not hiding this. I'm not hiding you."

Noel's heart swelled. "Okay."

They walked back to Noel's apartment as the sun started to set, painting the sky in shades of pink and gold. Inside, they made hot chocolate and curled up on the couch, wrapped in blankets, watching the snow fall outside.

"Tomorrow is the last day," Noel said again, quieter this time.

"I know," Eben said.

"What happens after?"

Eben considered the question, his arm tightening around Noel's shoulders. "I stay," he said finally. "I figure out what it looks like to live here. To build a life with you. To stop running."

"That's not a very detailed plan," Noel said, but he was smiling.

"No," Eben agreed. "But it's a start."

Noel thought about that—about starting over, about building something new, about choosing each other every day without guarantees. It was terrifying. It was also the best thing he could imagine.

"Okay," he said.

Eben pulled back slightly, looking at him with something like wonder. "Okay?"

"Okay." Noel leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Eben's lips. "Let's start."

"That okay counts," Eben said, echoing the callback from earlier.

Noel laughed, bright and real. "It counts."

They settled back into the couch, wrapped around each other, and watched the snow fall. Outside, Frostwick was preparing for the final day of the festival. But inside Noel's apartment, warm and safe and together, it felt like they had all the time in the world.

### POV: EBEN

Night fell slowly, the apartment growing dark except for the glow of the streetlights outside.

Eben held Noel close, feeling the steady rhythm of his breathing, and thought about how close he'd come to losing this. How close he'd come to running, to choosing fear over love, to letting his past dictate his future.

But he hadn't. He'd chosen to stay. And Noel had chosen to let him.

"I'm scared," Eben admitted quietly.

Noel shifted, looking up at him. "Of what?"

"Of messing this up," Eben said honestly. "Of falling back into old patterns. Of—"

"Hey." Noel's hand came up to cup his face, gentle and grounding. "We're going to mess up. Both of us. That's part of being human. But we'll figure it out together. Okay?"

"Okay," Eben said, and felt some of the tension ease from his shoulders.

"I'm scared too," Noel admitted. "Of not being enough. Of you realizing you made a mistake. Of—"

"You're enough," Eben interrupted firmly. "You're more than enough. And I'm not going anywhere."

Noel smiled, small and tentative. "Promise?"

"Promise."

They kissed, soft and slow, and Eben felt something settle in his chest. This was what he wanted. This person, this moment, this life they were building together.

"Come on," Noel said eventually, pulling back. "Let's go to bed."

They moved to the bedroom, getting ready for sleep with the easy familiarity of people who'd done this before. When they finally climbed into bed, Noel immediately curled into Eben's side, his head on Eben's chest.

"Merry Christmas," Noel murmured, already half-asleep.

"Merry Christmas," Eben replied, pressing a kiss to the top of Noel's head.

He lay there for a while, listening to Noel's breathing even out, feeling the weight of him warm and solid against his side. Outside, snow continued to fall, blanketing Frostwick in white.

Tomorrow was the last day of the festival. The last day of the twelve days of Christmas. And then... then they'd figure out what came next.

But for now, Eben was content to just be here. To hold Noel. To let himself believe that this was real.

### POV: NOEL

Noel fell asleep on Christmas Eve with Eben's arm around him and thought: *This is what staying feels like.*

It felt like warmth. Like safety. Like coming home after a long journey and finding the door unlocked, the lights on, someone waiting for you inside.

It felt like Eben's heartbeat under his ear, steady and sure. Like the weight of Eben's arm around his shoulders, grounding him. Like the soft press of Eben's lips against his temple, a wordless promise.

It felt like hope.

Noel had spent so long believing that love was something you earned, something you had to work for, something that could be taken away if you weren't useful enough, good enough, perfect enough.

But this—this thing with Eben—wasn't like that. It was messy and complicated and sometimes scary, but it was also real. It was choosing each other, every day, without guarantees. It was being brave enough to be vulnerable. It was staying, even when it was hard.

It was love.

And for the first time in a long time, Noel let himself believe he deserved it.

Outside, snow fell softly over Frostwick, covering the town in a blanket of white. Inside, wrapped in Eben's arms, Noel felt something he hadn't felt in years:

Peace.

Tomorrow would bring new challenges. Tomorrow they'd have to figure out what it looked like to build a life together, to navigate the messy reality of a relationship, to keep choosing each other when things got hard.

But tonight, on Christmas Eve, Noel let himself just be. Just feel. Just stay.

And as he drifted off to sleep, warm and safe and loved, his last thought was simple:

*This is what staying feels like.*
