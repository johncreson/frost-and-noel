# Chapter 6
## POV: Noel

The festival ended at sunset.

Noel stood at the edge of Merryweather Hall, watching the final performance wind down—eleven pipers in full regalia, their music bright and clear in the cold evening air. The crowd was entranced, faces lit with wonder, and Noel felt a swell of pride that had nothing to do with logistics or planning.

They'd done it. Twelve days of chaos, and they'd actually pulled it off.

Eben appeared at his elbow, close enough that their shoulders brushed. "You okay?"

"Yeah." Noel turned to look at him, taking in the soft expression on Eben's face. "I'm good. Just... processing."

"It's a lot."

"It is." Noel glanced back at the performance, then back at Eben. "Can we get out of here? Just for a bit?"

Eben's hand found his, their fingers lacing together. "Where do you want to go?"

"Anywhere that's not here."

They slipped out the side door, into the quiet of the evening. The air was crisp and cold, snow crunching under their feet as they walked. Noel didn't have a destination in mind—just wanted to move, to breathe, to have a moment alone with Eben before the closing ceremony demanded his attention again.

They ended up at the gazebo in the town square, the same one where they'd stood weeks ago during the first festival event. It felt like a lifetime ago. Like they'd been different people then.

Maybe they had been.

Noel sat on the bench, and Eben sat beside him, their thighs pressed together. For a while, neither of them spoke—just sat in the comfortable silence, watching the town move around them.

"In EP7," Noel said eventually, breaking the quiet. "On the ice. I tried to tell you something."

Eben turned to look at him, his expression careful. "I remember."

"I didn't finish it." Noel's fingers twisted together in his lap, restless. "Someone interrupted, and I let them. Because I was scared."

"What were you trying to say?"

Noel took a breath, forcing himself to meet Eben's eyes. "I need you."

The words felt too big, too vulnerable, but Noel pushed through. "Not to fix things. Not to run the festival. Not to be useful. I need you because—"

He stopped. Swallowed hard. Tried again.

"Because I'm better when you stay."

Eben's expression went soft, something complicated flickering across his face. "Noel—"

"I know I can't ask you to stay just because I want you to," Noel continued, the words tumbling out now. "I know that's not fair. But I—"

"Stop." Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's face, his touch gentle. "Stop apologizing for wanting me."

"I don't know how to do this without apologizing."

"I know." Eben's thumb brushed over Noel's cheekbone, and Noel realized with a start that he was crying. "But you don't have to earn this. You don't have to be useful to be wanted. You just have to let me stay."

Noel closed his eyes, overwhelmed. "What if I'm not enough?"

"You are." Eben's voice was firm, certain. "You're more than enough. You always have been."

"I don't know how to believe that."

"Then let me prove it to you." Eben leaned in, pressing his forehead against Noel's. "Every day. For as long as it takes."

Noel's breath hitched. "You mean that?"

"I mean it." Eben pulled back just enough to meet his eyes. "I'm staying, Noel. I'm choosing you. Every day."

"Even when I'm difficult?"

"Especially when you're difficult."

Despite everything, Noel laughed—a wet, shaky sound that was half-sob. "You're insane."

"Probably." Eben smiled, soft and private. "But I'm your kind of insane."

Noel kissed him, pouring everything he couldn't say into it—all the fear and hope and desperate, aching want. Eben kissed him back like he understood, like he felt it too, and for the first time in weeks, Noel let himself believe that maybe, just maybe, this could work.

When they pulled apart, both breathing hard, Noel rested his forehead against Eben's. "I need you," he said again, quieter this time. "I need you to stay."

"I'm staying," Eben said. "I promise."

"Okay."

"That okay counts," Eben said, and Noel heard the echo of Wes and Sam in the words, the callback to a conversation weeks ago.

Noel laughed, real and bright. "It counts."

They sat there for a while longer, wrapped around each other, letting the world move on without them. The festival would end. The town would go back to normal. But this—this thing they were building together—would stay.

"We should probably get back," Noel said eventually, reluctant. "The closing ceremony—"

"Can wait," Eben said, echoing his words from earlier. "Just... give me a few more minutes."

Noel smiled. "Okay."

They stayed in the gazebo, holding each other, and let the world wait.

### Later

The closing ceremony was beautiful.

Noel stood at the edge of the crowd, watching the final speech, the lighting of the Christmas tree, the way the whole town came together to celebrate the end of the festival. Eben was beside him, their hands linked, and Noel felt a swell of something he couldn't quite name.

Gratitude, maybe. Or relief. Or just... happiness.

"You did good," Eben murmured, his voice low enough that only Noel could hear.

"We did good," Noel corrected.

Eben smiled. "Yeah. We did."

The crowd erupted into applause as the tree lit up, thousands of lights sparkling against the dark sky. Noel watched it for a moment, then turned to look at Eben—really look at him, taking in the soft expression on his face, the way he was watching the tree with something like wonder.

"I love you," Noel said, the words slipping out before he could stop them.

Eben's head whipped around, his eyes wide. "What?"

Noel's heart was pounding, but he didn't take it back. "I love you. I'm in love with you. And I know we're not—I know it's too soon, or too fast, or whatever, but I—"

Eben kissed him, cutting off the rambling apology. It was soft and sweet and full of promise, and when he pulled back, his eyes were bright.

"I love you too," Eben said, his voice rough with emotion. "I'm in love with you, Noel."

Noel's breath caught. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." Eben's hand came up to cup his face, thumb brushing over his cheekbone. "I'm staying. I'm choosing you. And I love you."

Noel kissed him again, and this time it was deeper, more certain, like they were both finally letting themselves believe this was real.

Around them, the crowd cheered—for the tree, for the festival, for the magic of Christmas Eve in a small town. But Noel barely heard it. All he could focus on was Eben, and the way he was looking at Noel like he was something precious.

"Come home with me," Noel said when they finally pulled apart.

"I thought you'd never ask."

They slipped away from the crowd, hand in hand, and walked back to Noel's apartment through the quiet streets. The festival was over. The twelve days were done. But this—this thing they were building—was just beginning.

And for the first time in a long time, Noel wasn't scared of what came next.

**[Note: This chapter completes Noel's vulnerability arc by having him finish the sentence from EP7. The "I need you" declaration is paired with the first "I love you" exchange, which feels earned after the repair work of the previous chapters. The chapter ends with them returning to Noel's apartment, setting up the intimacy of Chapter 7.]**
