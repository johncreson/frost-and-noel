# Chapter 5
## POV: Eben

Eben woke to sunlight streaming through unfamiliar windows and Noel's weight warm against his side.

For a moment, he didn't move—just lay there, cataloging the feeling. The softness of Noel's sheets. The sound of Noel's breathing, slow and even. The way Noel's hand was curled against Eben's chest, like even in sleep he was holding on.

*I could get used to this,* Eben thought, and the realization didn't scare him the way it would have a week ago.

Noel stirred, his eyes blinking open slowly. When he saw Eben, his expression went soft—not guarded, not performative, just... happy.

"Morning," Noel murmured, his voice rough with sleep.

"Morning."

They lay there for a while, neither quite ready to move, until Noel shifted and propped himself up on one elbow. "I should probably check my phone. Make sure the festival didn't burn down overnight."

"Probably," Eben agreed, but he didn't let go.

Noel smiled, small and private, and leaned down to kiss him. It was soft, unhurried, the kind of kiss that said *we have time now*. When he pulled back, his eyes were serious.

"Last night," Noel started. "When you said you turned down the contract—"

"I meant it," Eben said immediately. "I'm not going anywhere."

"I know. I just—" Noel bit his lip, considering. "I need to understand. Why did you do it before talking to me? Before knowing if we could fix this?"

Eben sat up, pulling Noel with him so they were facing each other. This conversation deserved eye contact. Deserved honesty.

"Because I needed to choose you first," Eben said. "Not as a backup plan. Not as a 'maybe if this works out.' I needed to close the exit before I knew if you'd want me. Because otherwise, it wouldn't have been a real choice."

Noel's brow furrowed. "I don't understand."

"I've spent my whole life keeping one foot out the door," Eben explained. "Always having an exit strategy. Always making sure I could leave before I got left. And I realized—if I did that with you, if I kept the contract as a safety net, then I'd never really be choosing you. I'd just be... hedging my bets."

"That's terrifying."

"Yeah." Eben's hand found Noel's, their fingers lacing together. "It is. But it was also the only way to prove to myself that I was serious. That this wasn't just... convenient, or temporary, or something I was doing because I didn't have other options."

Noel was quiet for a long moment, his thumb tracing circles on the back of Eben's hand. "What if I'd said no? What if I'd told you to leave?"

"Then I would have dealt with it," Eben said honestly. "I would have been heartbroken. But I wouldn't have regretted choosing you. Because the choice had to come first. Without guarantees."

"You're insane," Noel said, but his voice was soft, awed.

"Probably." Eben smiled, small and tentative. "But I'm your kind of insane, apparently."

Noel laughed, the sound bright and real, and kissed him again. This time it was deeper, more certain, like Noel was finally letting himself believe this was real.

When they pulled apart, Noel's eyes were bright. "Say it again."

"I chose you."

"Again."

"I chose you, Noel. I'm choosing you. I'll keep choosing you."

Noel's breath hitched. "Even though it's scary?"

"Especially because it's scary." Eben cupped Noel's face, his thumb brushing over his cheekbone. "Because the things worth having are always scary. And you're worth it."

"I don't know what I did to deserve you," Noel whispered.

"You don't have to do anything," Eben said firmly. "You don't have to earn this. You just have to let me stay."

Noel closed his eyes, and Eben saw the moment something in him shifted—not breaking, but opening. Letting the truth of it in.

"Okay," Noel said finally. "Okay. Stay."

"I'm staying."

They sat there for a while longer, just holding each other, letting the weight of the last few days settle into something they could carry together. Outside, Frostwick was waking up—the sounds of traffic, of people starting their Christmas Eve, of a town preparing for its final festival event.

But in Noel's bedroom, wrapped in each other, it felt like they had all the time in the world.

### Later

They made breakfast together—or rather, Noel made breakfast while Eben sat at the kitchen counter and watched, occasionally offering commentary that Noel ignored with fond exasperation.

"You're terrible at this," Noel said, flipping a pancake with more force than strictly necessary.

"I'm providing moral support," Eben countered. "That's important."

"You're providing running commentary on my pancake technique. That's annoying."

"You love it."

Noel paused, spatula in hand, and turned to look at Eben. The word hung in the air between them—*love*—not quite said but hovering close enough to touch.

"Yeah," Noel said softly. "I do."

Eben's chest went tight. They weren't there yet—weren't ready to say the word out loud, not when everything was still so new and fragile. But the acknowledgment of it, the permission to feel it, was enough.

"Good," Eben said, his voice rough. "Because I'm not going anywhere."

They ate breakfast at the small kitchen table, knees bumping under the table, and talked about the day ahead. The final festival event. The closing ceremony. The fact that after tonight, the twelve days would be over and they'd have to figure out what came next.

"What do you want to do?" Noel asked. "After the festival, I mean. Do you have plans? Or—"

"I want to stay here," Eben said. "In Frostwick. With you. If that's okay."

Noel's smile was bright enough to rival the sun. "That's more than okay."

"Good." Eben reached across the table, taking Noel's hand. "Because I meant what I said. I'm choosing you. Every day. For as long as you'll have me."

"That's a long time," Noel said, echoing his words from the night before.

"I'm counting on it."

They finished breakfast in comfortable silence, the kind that felt less like running out of things to say and more like not needing to fill every moment with words. When they were done, Noel stood and started clearing the dishes, but Eben caught his wrist.

"Leave them," Eben said. "Come here."

Noel raised an eyebrow. "The dishes—"

"Can wait." Eben tugged him closer, until Noel was standing between his knees. "I want to talk to you about something."

Noel's expression shifted, a flicker of worry crossing his face. "Okay?"

"Nothing bad," Eben said quickly. "I just—I want to make sure we're on the same page. About what this is. About what we're doing."

"What do you mean?"

Eben took a breath, trying to organize his thoughts. "I don't want this to be temporary. I don't want to wake up in six months and realize we never actually talked about what we want, and we're just... drifting. I want to be intentional about this. About us."

Noel's expression softened. "What do you want, Eben?"

"You," Eben said simply. "I want you. I want to build something with you. I want to figure out what it looks like when I stay, and you let me, and we stop being scared of what that means."

"I want that too," Noel said, his voice barely above a whisper.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." Noel's hand came up to cup Eben's face, his touch gentle. "I want you to stay. I want to stop waiting for you to leave. I want to believe that this is real."

"It is real," Eben said. "I'm making it real. We're making it real."

Noel kissed him, slow and deep, and Eben felt the last of his fear dissolve into something warmer. Something that felt like hope.

When they pulled apart, Noel rested his forehead against Eben's. "We should probably get ready. The festival—"

"Can wait," Eben said again. "Just... give me a few more minutes. Please."

Noel smiled. "Okay."

They stood there in the kitchen, wrapped around each other, and let the world wait.

### Afternoon

By the time they made it to Merryweather Hall, the setup was already in full swing. Volunteers rushed around with decorations and sound equipment, and the energy was electric—the kind of barely-controlled chaos that came with the final event of a twelve-day festival.

Wes spotted them first. His eyes went wide, then narrowed, and then he was crossing the hall with purpose.

"You two," he said, pointing at them. "You fixed it."

It wasn't a question.

"We're working on it," Noel said, but he was smiling, and Eben saw Wes's expression soften.

"Good," Wes said. "Because watching you two mope around was exhausting. Don't do it again."

"We'll try," Eben said dryly.

Wes looked between them, then nodded once, satisfied. "Sam's going to be insufferable when he finds out he was right."

"He was right?" Noel asked.

"He said you'd figure it out by Christmas Eve. I said it would take at least another week." Wes sighed dramatically. "I owe him twenty bucks now."

Despite everything, Eben laughed. "You bet on us?"

"The whole town bet on you," Wes said matter-of-factly. "You're not exactly subtle."

Noel groaned, burying his face in his hands. "Oh my God."

"Don't worry about it," Wes said, clapping him on the shoulder. "We're all rooting for you. Now get to work. This event isn't going to run itself."

He walked away, leaving Eben and Noel standing in the middle of the hall, both slightly stunned.

"The whole town," Noel said faintly.

"Apparently," Eben agreed.

They looked at each other, and then they were both laughing, the sound bright and free and full of relief.

"Come on," Noel said, taking Eben's hand. "Let's go make sure the pipers don't set anything on fire."

"Together?"

"Together."

And for the first time in a long time, Eben believed it.

It shows them moving from repair into building something intentional together, with the found family (Wes) providing comic relief and validation. The chapter balances emotional weight with lighter moments.]**
