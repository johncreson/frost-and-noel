# Chapter 7
## POV: Both (Alternating)

### POV: NOEL

The door to Noel's apartment closed behind them with a soft click, and suddenly the world narrowed to just the two of them.

Noel's heart was pounding—not with anxiety, but with anticipation. With want. With the knowledge that this time, it would be different. This time, they were choosing each other with full knowledge of what that meant.

Eben was watching him, his expression soft and open in a way Noel had rarely seen. "Are you sure about this?"

"I'm sure." Noel stepped closer, his hands coming up to rest on Eben's chest. "I want this. I want you."

"I want you too," Eben said, his voice rough. "God, Noel, I—"

Noel kissed him, cutting off whatever he'd been about to say. The kiss was slow, deliberate, full of intention. Not frantic or desperate like before, but certain. *I'm choosing this. I'm choosing you.*

Eben's hands came up to cup Noel's face, his touch gentle, and Noel felt something in his chest crack open. This was what he'd been missing. This tenderness. This care.

"Tell me you're staying," Noel whispered against Eben's lips.

"I'm staying," Eben said immediately. "I'm not going anywhere."

"Say it again."

"I'm staying, Noel. I'm here. I'm yours."

Noel's breath hitched, and he kissed Eben again, deeper this time. Eben responded in kind, his hands sliding down to Noel's waist, pulling him closer until there was no space left between them.

They moved to the bedroom without breaking apart, a tangle of limbs and breathless laughter when they nearly tripped over Noel's shoes. When they finally made it to the bed, Eben pulled back just enough to look at Noel's face.

"I love you," Eben said, the words simple and devastating.

"I love you too," Noel replied, and it felt like the easiest thing in the world to say.

### POV: EBEN

Eben had imagined this moment more times than he could count.

But the reality was so much better than anything his imagination had conjured. Because this wasn't just physical—it was emotional, vulnerable, real in a way that made his chest ache.

He kissed Noel slowly, taking his time, memorizing the taste of him, the sound of his breathing, the way he arched into Eben's touch like he was starving for it. And maybe he was. Maybe they both were.

"Tell me what you want," Eben murmured against Noel's skin.

"You," Noel said, his voice breathless. "Just you."

"You have me." Eben's hands moved over Noel's body, learning the planes and angles of him, the places that made him gasp. "You've always had me."

Noel's hands were equally busy, pulling at Eben's shirt, his touch both reverent and urgent. "I need—"

"I know," Eben said, helping him with the buttons. "I've got you."

They undressed each other slowly, carefully, like they were unwrapping something precious. When they were finally skin to skin, Eben paused, just looking at Noel—flushed and wanting and beautiful in the soft lamplight.

"You're staring," Noel said, but there was no heat in it. Just fondness.

"Can't help it," Eben said honestly. "You're—"

"Don't," Noel interrupted, his cheeks going pink. "Don't get sappy on me."

"Too late." Eben leaned down, pressing a kiss to Noel's collarbone. "I'm already gone."

Noel laughed, the sound bright and free, and pulled Eben down into another kiss.

### POV: NOEL

They took their time.

There was no rush, no frantic urgency like there had been before. Just slow, deliberate touches, whispered words, the kind of intimacy that came from knowing they had all the time in the world.

Eben's hands were everywhere—gentle, careful, like Noel was something to be cherished. And maybe he was. Maybe that was what this felt like: being cherished.

"I'm sorry," Eben whispered at one point, his lips against Noel's shoulder. "For what I said. For making you think I didn't want this."

"I know," Noel said, his fingers threading through Eben's hair. "I've got you."

"Say my name," Eben said, his voice rough.

"Eben," Noel breathed, and felt Eben shudder against him.

They moved together, finding a rhythm that felt natural, inevitable. Noel had never felt so present, so connected, so *seen*. Every touch, every kiss, every whispered word was a promise: *I'm here. I'm staying. I choose you.*

"I love you," Noel said again, because he couldn't say it enough. "I love you, Eben."

"I love you too," Eben replied, his voice breaking on the words. "God, Noel, I love you so much."

### POV: EBEN

Eben had never been good with words.

But here, now, with Noel beneath him, he found himself saying things he'd never said to anyone. "You're everything," he whispered against Noel's skin. "You're everything I didn't know I wanted."

Noel's hands tightened on his shoulders, pulling him closer. "Don't stop," he said, and Eben wasn't sure if he meant the words or the touch, but it didn't matter. He wasn't stopping either way.

They built toward completion slowly, the tension coiling tighter and tighter until it finally broke. Noel's voice, breathless and wrecked, saying Eben's name like a prayer. Eben's own release following moments later, overwhelming and perfect.

Afterward, they lay tangled together, both breathing hard, neither quite ready to move. Eben pressed a kiss to Noel's temple, then his cheek, then his lips.

"You okay?" Eben asked softly.

"More than okay," Noel said, his voice drowsy and content. "That was—"

"Yeah," Eben agreed, because there weren't really words for what that had been.

They shifted, getting comfortable, and Eben pulled Noel close, wrapping his arms around him. Noel's head rested on Eben's chest, his breathing evening out, and Eben felt something settle in his chest.

This was what he wanted. This person, this moment, this life they were building together.

"I'm staying," Eben said again, because Noel needed to hear it. Because he needed to say it.

"I know," Noel murmured, already half-asleep. "I believe you."

And that, Eben thought, was everything.

### POV: NOEL

Noel woke sometime later to find Eben still awake, his fingers tracing idle patterns on Noel's shoulder.

"Can't sleep?" Noel asked, his voice rough.

"Just thinking," Eben said.

"About what?"

"About how lucky I am." Eben's hand stilled, coming to rest over Noel's heart. "About how close I came to losing this."

Noel shifted, propping himself up so he could see Eben's face. "You didn't lose it."

"I could have," Eben said quietly. "If you hadn't been brave enough to give me another chance—"

"Stop," Noel interrupted gently. "We both made mistakes. We both had to be brave. And we're here now. That's what matters."

Eben's eyes were too bright. "I don't deserve you."

"That's not how this works," Noel said firmly. "You don't have to deserve me. You just have to choose me. And you did."

"I did," Eben agreed. "I do. Every day."

Noel kissed him, soft and sweet, and felt Eben relax beneath him. "We're going to be okay," Noel said. "We're going to figure this out together."

"Together," Eben echoed, like he was testing the word. "I like the sound of that."

"Good." Noel settled back down, his head on Eben's chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. "Because you're stuck with me now."

"Best thing that ever happened to me," Eben murmured, his fingers resuming their gentle patterns on Noel's skin.

Noel smiled, his eyes drifting closed. "Go to sleep, Eben."

"In a minute," Eben said. "I just want to—"

But whatever he wanted to say was lost as sleep finally claimed him. Noel felt the moment Eben's breathing evened out, felt the way his body relaxed completely, and thought: *This is what home feels like.*

He fell asleep with that thought, warm and safe and loved, and didn't dream of anything but tomorrow.
