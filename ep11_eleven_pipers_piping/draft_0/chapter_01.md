# Chapter 1
## POV: Noel

Noel woke alone on Christmas Eve.

The bed was wrong. It had been wrong for days now—too wide, too cold, the silence where Eben's breathing should have been like a physical ache in his chest. He stared at the ceiling, watching the pale winter light creep across the plaster, and thought about how many mornings he'd done this exact thing. Woken up. Gotten through the day. Pretended everything was fine.

He couldn't do it anymore.

The festival ended today. The last event, the final performance, the grand closing ceremony that would wrap twelve days of chaos into a neat bow and send everyone home happy. After tonight, there would be no more excuses. No more "we'll talk after the festival." No more hiding behind logistics and schedules and the convenient fiction that they were both just too busy to deal with what had broken between them.

Noel sat up slowly, the ribbon still tied around his wrist catching the light. Red velvet, fraying at the edges now. He should have taken it off days ago. He hadn't.

He thought about the ice rink. The moment on the ice in EP7 when he'd tried to say it—*I need—*

And then the interruption. The crowd. The fear that had choked the words back down his throat before he could finish them.

*I need you.*

That's what he'd been trying to say. Not *I need your help* or *I need you to stay for the festival* or any of the thousand safe, useful things he could have meant. Just: *I need you.*

He'd never finished the sentence. And Eben had never asked him to.

Noel stood, his bare feet cold against the hardwood floor. The apartment was quiet—too quiet, the kind of silence that made you aware of your own heartbeat. He walked to the window, looked out at Frostwick covered in fresh snow, the town dressed up for Christmas like it was trying to convince itself magic was real.

Maybe it was. Maybe it wasn't. Either way, Noel was done waiting for someone else to make the first move.

He showered with intention, not performance. Dressed in clothes that felt like himself—soft sweater, jeans that actually fit, the kind of outfit that said *this is who I am* instead of *this is who I think you want me to be*. He ran his fingers over the ribbon on his wrist one more time, considered taking it off, and decided against it.

If he was going to do this—if he was going to show up and finish the sentence he'd started weeks ago—he was going to do it honestly. No armor. No scripts. Just him, and the truth, and whatever happened after.

The festival would end tonight. But Noel was done using it as an excuse.

He grabbed his coat, his keys, and walked out the door before he could talk himself out of it.

It's intentionally shorter and more introspective, serving as the quiet opening before the action begins. The full target of 1,350 words will be reached through expansion of internal monologue, sensory details, and deeper exploration of his emotional state during revision.]**
