9. Ensure chapter numbering is consistent

### For Final Polish

## Key Thematic Elements

1. **Repair over perfection:** The relationship isn't fixed perfectly; they're choosing to work on it
2. **Verbal intimacy:** Chapter 7 emphasizes words during intimacy (opposite of rupture)
3. **Choice without guarantees:** Eben chose before knowing the outcome
4. **Earned vulnerability:** Both characters articulate their core wounds
5. **Found family support:** The town actively pushes them together
6. **Staying as active choice:** Not passive default, but daily decision
