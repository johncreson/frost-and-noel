# Chapter 3
## POV: Eben

The storage room smelled like dust and old tinsel.

Eben stood in the middle of it, acutely aware of how small the space was, how close Noel was, how there was nowhere to hide from this conversation. The single overhead bulb cast harsh shadows, making Noel's face difficult to read—but Eben could see the tension in his shoulders, the way he held himself like he was bracing for impact.

"I need to explain," Eben said again, because he didn't know how else to start.

"Then explain." Noel's voice was flat, carefully neutral. Not helping. Not making this easy.

Eben deserved that.

He took a breath, trying to organize the chaos in his head into something coherent. "When I said... what I said. About this never being supposed to last. I didn't mean it."

"You said it, though."

"I know." Eben's hands clenched at his sides. "I know I did. And I can't take it back. But I need you to understand—I didn't mean it. I was scared, and I—"

"Scared of what?" Noel pushed off the wall, taking a step closer. His eyes were too bright, his voice too controlled. "Scared of me? Scared of this? What were you so scared of that you had to—"

He cut himself off, jaw tight, and Eben saw the moment Noel decided not to finish that sentence. Decided not to give voice to how much it had hurt.

"Scared of wanting you to stay," Eben said quietly.

The words fell into the silence like stones into water. Noel went very still.

"I've spent my whole life believing that attachment ends in loss," Eben continued, forcing himself to keep going even though every instinct screamed at him to stop. "Everyone leaves. Everyone moves on. That's just... that's how it works. So I learned not to get attached. Not to want people to stay. Because wanting them to stay just makes it hurt more when they go."

Noel's expression shifted—something complicated flickering across his face. Not forgiveness. Not yet. But understanding, maybe. Or at least the beginning of it.

"And then you—" Eben's voice cracked. He swallowed hard, tried again. "You made me want you to stay. And I didn't know what to do with that. So when you started talking about the future, about what happens after the festival, I—"

"You panicked," Noel finished, his voice softer now.

"I panicked," Eben agreed. "And I said the worst thing I could think of. To make you leave first. Before you could—"

"Before I could leave on my own."

"Yeah."

The silence stretched between them, heavy with everything unsaid. Eben could hear his own heartbeat, too loud in the quiet space.

"That doesn't make it okay," Noel said finally.

"I know." Eben met his eyes, held his gaze even though it felt like standing in front of a firing squad. "I'm not asking you to forget it. I'm not asking you to pretend it didn't happen. I just—"

He stopped. Started over.

"I'm asking if you can believe I didn't mean it."

Noel looked at him for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then: "What do you want, Eben?"

The use of his first name landed like permission. Like an opening. Like maybe, just maybe, there was still a chance to fix this.

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Tried to find the words for something he'd never let himself want before.

"I don't know how to answer that," he admitted.

"Try."

It wasn't a suggestion. It was a challenge. A demand. *Be brave enough to tell me the truth.*

Eben thought about the contract in his pocket—the one he'd declined two days ago, the one that would have given him an exit, a way out, a convenient excuse to leave before things got too complicated. He thought about Sam's words: *You don't get to make that decision for him.*

He thought about what it meant to choose something, someone, without guarantees.

"You," Eben said, the word barely more than a whisper. "I want you."

Noel's breath hitched. He didn't move, didn't speak, just waited.

"I want you to stay," Eben continued, the words coming faster now, like a dam breaking. "I want to wake up next to you. I want to argue about coffee and listen to you stress about logistics and watch you organize things that don't need organizing. I want—"

He stopped, overwhelmed by the enormity of it. By how much he wanted. By how terrifying it was to say it out loud.

"I want you," he said again, simpler this time. "I'm scared. I'm choosing you anyway."

The silence that followed felt different. Lighter, somehow. Like something had shifted.

Noel's eyes were too bright. "Say it again."

"I'm choosing you."

"Again."

"I'm choosing you, Noel."

Noel closed his eyes, and Eben saw the moment something in him broke—not shattered, but cracked open, letting light in. When he opened them again, there were tears on his lashes.

"I turned down the January contract," Eben said, because if he was doing this, he was doing it all the way. "Two days ago. Before I knew if you'd—if we could—"

"What?" Noel's eyes went wide. "The contract? The one in January?"

"I closed the exit," Eben said. "Before I knew if you'd want me. Because I needed to choose first. Without guarantees."

The weight of that hung in the air between them. Eben watched Noel process it—the timeline, the implications, the fact that Eben had made the choice before the conversation, before the apology, before any of this.

"You already chose," Noel said, his voice barely audible.

"I already chose."

Noel made a sound that was half-laugh, half-sob. "You're an idiot."

"I know."

"You should have told me."

"I know."

"I thought—" Noel's voice broke. "I thought you wanted to leave."

"I don't." Eben took a step closer, close enough to touch if he was brave enough. "I don't want to leave. I want to stay. With you. If you'll—"

He didn't get to finish the sentence. Noel closed the distance between them, his hand coming up to cup Eben's face, and kissed him.

It wasn't desperate. It wasn't frantic. It was careful, tentative, like they were both learning how to do this again. Like they were both afraid of breaking something fragile.

When they pulled apart, Noel's forehead rested against Eben's, their breath mingling in the small space between them.

"We're not done talking about this," Noel said.

"I know."

"But I—" Noel swallowed hard. "I need to tell you something too."

Eben pulled back just enough to meet his eyes. "Okay."

"Not here," Noel said. "Somewhere private. Somewhere that's not a storage room."

Despite everything, Eben felt a smile tug at his lips. "Your place?"

"My place."

They stood there for another moment, neither quite ready to let go, before Noel stepped back and reached for the door.

"Come on," he said. "Let's get out of here before someone finds us and puts us to work."

Eben followed him out of the storage room, into the noise and chaos of the hall, and thought: *This is what choosing feels like.*

The contract reveal happens here, establishing that Eben chose Noel before knowing if Noel would choose him back. The chapter ends with them moving toward a more private space for Noel's turn to be vulnerable.]**
