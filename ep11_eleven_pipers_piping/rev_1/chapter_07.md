# Chapter 7
## POV: Both (Alternating)

### POV: NOEL

The door to Noel's apartment closed behind them with a soft click, and suddenly the world narrowed to just the two of them.

The noise of the festival, the crowd, the cold December air—all of it faded away, replaced by the warm quiet of Noel's apartment and the sound of their breathing, slightly unsteady, slightly too fast. The only light came from the streetlamps outside, casting soft shadows across the floor.

Noel's heart was pounding—not with anxiety, but with anticipation. With want. With the knowledge that this time, it would be different. This time, they were choosing each other with full knowledge of what that meant.

Eben was watching him, his expression soft and open in a way Noel had rarely seen. All the walls were down. All the defenses stripped away. Just Eben, looking at Noel like he was something precious.

"Are you sure about this?" Eben asked, his voice quiet in the stillness.

"I'm sure." Noel stepped closer, eliminating the distance between them, his hands coming up to rest on Eben's chest. He could feel Eben's heart beating beneath his palms—fast, matching his own. "I want this. I want you."

"I want you too," Eben said, his voice rough. "God, Noel, I—"

Noel kissed him, cutting off whatever he'd been about to say. The kiss was slow, deliberate, full of intention. Not frantic or desperate like it might have been before, but certain. *I'm choosing this. I'm choosing you.*

Eben's hands came up to cup Noel's face, his touch gentle and reverent, and Noel felt something in his chest crack open. This was what he'd been missing. This tenderness. This care. The feeling of being held like he mattered, not for what he could do, but for who he was.

"Tell me you're staying," Noel whispered against Eben's lips.

"I'm staying," Eben said immediately, no hesitation. "I'm not going anywhere."

"Say it again."

"I'm staying, Noel. I'm here. I'm yours."

Noel's breath hitched, something hot and overwhelming building behind his eyes. He kissed Eben again, deeper this time, pouring all the words he couldn't say into the press of his lips, the slide of his tongue. Eben responded in kind, his hands sliding down to Noel's waist, pulling him closer until there was no space left between them.

They moved toward the bedroom without breaking apart, a tangle of limbs and breathless laughter when Noel nearly tripped over his own shoes by the door. Eben caught him, steadied him, pressed a smile against his temple.

"Careful," Eben murmured, and there was so much tenderness in that single word that Noel felt his throat go tight.

When they finally made it to the bed, Eben pulled back just enough to look at Noel's face. The streetlight from outside painted half his features in gold, the other half in shadow, and his eyes were dark with want.

"I love you," Eben said, the words simple and devastating.

"I love you too," Noel replied, and it felt like the easiest thing in the world to say.

### POV: EBEN

Eben had imagined this moment more times than he could count.

Late at night, when he couldn't sleep. In the stolen moments between one festival crisis and the next. In the days since their fight, when he'd lain awake staring at unfamiliar ceilings and wondering if he'd ruined everything.

But the reality was so much better than anything his imagination had conjured. Because this wasn't just physical—it was emotional, vulnerable, real in a way that made his chest ache with something that felt terrifyingly close to hope.

He kissed Noel slowly, taking his time, memorizing the taste of him—coffee and something sweet, maybe hot chocolate from the festival. Memorizing the sound of his breathing, slightly ragged now. The way he arched into Eben's touch like he was starving for it.

And maybe he was. Maybe they both were.

"Tell me what you want," Eben murmured against Noel's skin, pressing kisses along his jaw, his throat, the sensitive spot just below his ear that made Noel shiver.

"You," Noel said, his voice breathless. "Just you."

"You have me." Eben's hands moved over Noel's body, learning him, relearning him—the planes and angles, the soft places and the firm ones, the spots that made him gasp. "You've always had me."

Noel's hands were equally busy, pulling at Eben's shirt with fingers that trembled slightly—not from cold, but from something else. Something that felt like relief and want and a desperation to be close. "I need—"

"I know," Eben said, helping him with the buttons. "I've got you."

They undressed each other slowly, carefully, like they were unwrapping something precious. Each article of clothing fell away, and with it, another layer of defense. By the time they were skin to skin, Eben felt more exposed than he ever had in his life—and more safe.

He paused, just looking at Noel spread out beneath him—flushed and wanting and beautiful in the soft light. His hair was mussed, his lips swollen from kissing, and his eyes...

His eyes were looking at Eben like he was home.

"You're staring," Noel said, but there was no heat in it. Just fondness. Just love.

"Can't help it," Eben said honestly. "You're—"

"Don't," Noel interrupted, his cheeks going pink. "Don't get sappy on me."

"Too late." Eben leaned down, pressing a kiss to Noel's collarbone, then another lower, then another. "I'm already gone."

Noel laughed, the sound bright and free and full of joy, and pulled Eben down into another kiss.

### POV: NOEL

They took their time.

There was no rush, no frantic urgency like there might have been before. Just slow, deliberate touches, whispered words, the kind of intimacy that came from knowing they had all the time in the world.

Eben's hands were everywhere—gentle, careful, reverent. Like Noel was something to be cherished. And maybe he was. Maybe that was what this felt like: being cherished. Being wanted not for what he could do, but for who he was.

It was terrifying. It was wonderful. It was everything Noel had never let himself hope for.

"I'm sorry," Eben whispered at one point, his lips against Noel's shoulder, his fingers tracing patterns on Noel's hip. "For what I said. For making you think I didn't want this."

"I know," Noel said, his fingers threading through Eben's hair, holding him close. "I've got you."

"Say my name," Eben said, his voice rough.

"Eben," Noel breathed, and felt Eben shudder against him—a full-body tremor that had nothing to do with cold and everything to do with this, with them, with the way they fit together like puzzle pieces that had finally found their match.

They moved together, finding a rhythm that felt natural, inevitable. Noel had never felt so present, so connected, so *seen*. Every touch, every kiss, every whispered word was a promise: *I'm here. I'm staying. I choose you.*

"Tell me you're staying," Noel said, needing to hear it again.

"I'm staying."

"Tell me you want this."

"I want this. I want you. Only you."

"Tell me—" Noel's voice broke, overwhelmed by sensation and emotion. "Tell me I'm enough."

Eben stilled, pulling back just enough to look into Noel's eyes. His expression was fierce, tender, so full of love that Noel felt tears prick at his eyes.

"You're enough," Eben said, each word deliberate. "You're more than enough. You're everything."

Noel kissed him, swallowing the words, tasting them on his tongue. And then they were moving again, building toward something that felt like completion, like coming home.

"I love you," Noel said, because he couldn't say it enough. "I love you, Eben."

"I love you too," Eben replied, his voice breaking on the words. "God, Noel, I love you so much."

### POV: EBEN

Eben had never been good with words.

He was a fixer, a planner, a man who showed his feelings through action rather than speech. But here, now, with Noel beneath him, he found himself saying things he'd never said to anyone. Couldn't stop saying them. Like the walls he'd built around his heart had crumbled completely, leaving nothing but raw, vulnerable truth.

"You're everything," he whispered against Noel's skin, pressing the words into his shoulder, his chest, the hollow of his throat. "You're everything I didn't know I wanted."

Noel's hands tightened on his shoulders, pulling him closer. "Don't stop," he said, and Eben wasn't sure if he meant the words or the touch, but it didn't matter. He wasn't stopping either way.

"I was so scared," Eben confessed, the words spilling out between kisses. "So scared of wanting you. Of needing you. Of— of becoming someone who couldn't leave."

"Then stay," Noel said simply. "Stay and become that person. With me."

"I am." Eben's voice cracked. "I'm staying. I'm choosing this. I'm choosing you."

They built toward completion slowly, the tension coiling tighter and tighter, pleasure building in waves that crested and receded and crested again. When it finally broke, it was like a dam releasing—Noel's voice, breathless and wrecked, saying Eben's name like a prayer. Eben's own release following moments later, a surrender as much as a triumph.

For a long moment afterward, neither of them moved. Just lay there, tangled together, breathing hard, hearts pounding in sync.

"You okay?" Eben asked softly.

"More than okay," Noel said, his voice drowsy and content. "That was—"

"Yeah," Eben agreed, because there weren't really words for what that had been.

He pressed a kiss to Noel's temple, then his cheek, then his lips. Gentle now. Tender. The urgency was gone, replaced by something softer. Something that felt like peace.

### POV: NOEL

They shifted, getting comfortable, and Eben pulled Noel close, wrapping his arms around him like he never wanted to let go. Noel's head rested on Eben's chest, rising and falling with each breath, and he could hear Eben's heartbeat slowly returning to normal.

This was the part he'd always been afraid of—the after. The moment when the passion faded and you were left with just yourselves, exposed and vulnerable. The moment when the other person might decide you weren't worth the trouble after all.

But Eben wasn't pulling away. Wasn't checking his phone or making excuses to leave. He was just... holding Noel. Like this was exactly where he wanted to be.

"I'm staying," Eben said again, unprompted, like he knew Noel needed to hear it. Because he needed to say it.

"I know," Noel murmured, already half-asleep. "I believe you."

He felt Eben's arms tighten around him, felt the press of lips against his hair, and something in his chest that had been wound tight for years finally started to loosen.

This was what being loved felt like. Not earning love through service. Not performing worthiness. Just... being held. Being wanted. Being enough.

### POV: EBEN

Noel woke sometime later to find Eben still awake, his fingers tracing idle patterns on Noel's shoulder.

"Can't sleep?" Noel asked, his voice rough.

"Just thinking," Eben said.

"About what?"

"About how lucky I am." Eben's hand stilled, coming to rest over Noel's heart. "About how close I came to losing this."

Noel shifted, propping himself up so he could see Eben's face in the dim light. "You didn't lose it."

"I could have," Eben said quietly. "If you hadn't been brave enough to give me another chance—"

"Stop," Noel interrupted gently. "We both made mistakes. We both had to be brave. And we're here now. That's what matters."

Eben's eyes were too bright, and Noel realized with a start that he was seeing Eben cry for the first time. Not sobs—just a single tear tracking down his cheek, catching the light from outside.

"I don't deserve you," Eben whispered.

"That's not how this works," Noel said firmly. "You don't have to deserve me. You just have to choose me. And you did."

"I did," Eben agreed. "I do. Every day."

Noel kissed him, soft and sweet, and felt Eben relax beneath him. "We're going to be okay," Noel said. "We're going to figure this out together."

"Together," Eben echoed, like he was testing the word on his tongue. "I like the sound of that."

"Good." Noel settled back down, his head on Eben's chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. "Because you're stuck with me now."

"Best thing that ever happened to me," Eben murmured, his fingers resuming their gentle patterns on Noel's skin.

Noel smiled, his eyes drifting closed. "Go to sleep, Eben."

"In a minute," Eben said. "I just want to—"

But whatever he wanted to say was lost as sleep finally claimed him. Noel felt the moment Eben's breathing evened out, felt the way his body relaxed completely, and thought: *This is what home feels like.*

He fell asleep with that thought, warm and safe and loved, and didn't dream of anything but tomorrow.
