# Chapter 4
## POV: Dual (Eben leads)

### POV: EBEN

Noel's apartment was exactly as Eben remembered it—neat, organized, everything in its place. The books on the shelves were arranged by color. The throw pillows on the couch were perfectly fluffed. Even the shoes by the door were lined up with military precision.

But there was something different about it now, something he couldn't quite name. Maybe it was the way Noel moved through the space, less performative than usual—no cheerful bustling, no *let me be the perfect host* energy. Or maybe it was just that Eben was seeing it differently, now that he'd admitted he wanted to stay.

They stood in the living room, the door closed behind them, and the silence felt different than it had in the storage room. Less fraught. More... waiting.

"Do you want coffee?" Noel asked, his voice carefully neutral. "Or tea, or—"

"Noel." Eben caught his hand, gentle but firm. "You don't have to host me. We're past that."

Noel's shoulders sagged slightly, like he'd been holding himself up through sheer force of will and Eben had just given him permission to stop. "Okay."

They sat on the couch—not touching, but close enough that Eben could feel the warmth of Noel's body next to his. Close enough that it would be easy to reach out, if he was brave enough.

"You said you needed to tell me something," Eben prompted gently.

Noel nodded, his gaze fixed on his hands. The ribbon was still tied around his wrist, frayed and faded now. Eben wanted to ask about it—why he'd kept it, what it meant to him—but he didn't. Not yet.

"On the ice," Noel started, his voice quiet. "Weeks ago. I tried to say something to you."

Eben's chest tightened. "I remember."

"I didn't finish it." Noel's fingers twisted together, restless. "Someone interrupted—that group of kids who fell, remember?—and I let them. Let the interruption be an excuse. Because I was scared of what would happen if I said it out loud."

"What were you trying to say?"

Noel looked up, meeting Eben's eyes for the first time since they'd sat down. His expression was raw, unguarded in a way Eben had rarely seen. The performance was gone. The *everything's fine* mask had cracked.

"I need you," Noel said.

The words hung in the air between them, simple and devastating.

"Not to fix things," Noel continued, his voice gaining strength. "Not to run the festival. Not to be useful. I need you because—"

He stopped. Swallowed hard. Tried again.

"Because I'm better when you stay."

Eben felt something crack open in his chest. "Noel—"

"I know it's not fair," Noel said quickly, like he was afraid Eben would interrupt. "I know I can't ask you to stay just because I want you to. I know that's not how this works. But I—"

"Stop." Eben reached out, his hand cupping Noel's face, thumb brushing away a tear Noel probably didn't realize had fallen. "Stop apologizing for wanting me."

Noel's breath hitched. "I don't know how to do this without apologizing."

"I know." Eben's voice was soft, aching. "But you don't have to be useful to be wanted. You don't have to earn this."

"I don't know how to believe that."

"Then let me prove it to you."

The kiss was different this time—slower, deeper, less about desperation and more about *I'm here, I'm staying, I choose you*. Eben poured everything he couldn't say into it, every apology and promise and terrified hope, and felt Noel kiss him back like he was drowning and Eben was air.

When they pulled apart, both breathing hard, Noel's forehead rested against Eben's.

"I'm staying," Eben said, the words a vow. "I'm staying, Noel."

"Say it again."

"I'm staying."

"Again."

"I'm staying. I'm not going anywhere. I'm choosing you, and I'm staying."

Noel made a sound that was half-laugh, half-sob, and kissed him again.

### POV: NOEL

Noel had spent his whole life being useful.

He'd learned early that being needed was the closest thing to being wanted. His mother had been overwhelmed, his father distant, and the only time anyone seemed to notice him was when he was helping with something—setting the table, organizing the garage, making sure everyone else's lives ran smoothly.

So he'd gotten good at it. Made himself indispensable. Became the person who anticipated needs before anyone voiced them, who solved problems before they became problems, who was always there with the right answer, the right smile, the right *of course I don't mind, I'm happy to help*.

And if that meant he never got to fall apart himself? If it meant swallowing his own needs because there was always someone who needed him more? That was just the price of being loved.

Except it wasn't love, was it? It was dependency. It was being kept around because he was useful, not because anyone actually wanted him.

And then Eben had looked at him and said: *You don't have to be useful to be wanted.*

Noel didn't know how to believe that. But God, he wanted to.

They were still on the couch, Eben's arm around his shoulders, Noel's head resting against his chest. He could hear Eben's heartbeat, steady and real, and thought about what it meant to be chosen without having to earn it.

"I turned down the contract," Eben said again, like he needed Noel to understand. "Before I knew if you'd want me back. I chose you first."

"Why?"

"Because I needed to." Eben's hand moved through Noel's hair, gentle and grounding. "Because I couldn't keep one foot out the door and expect you to believe I was serious. Because choosing you had to come first, not second."

Noel closed his eyes, overwhelmed. "What if I'd said no?"

"Then I would have dealt with it." Eben's voice was quiet but certain. "But I wouldn't have regretted choosing you. Even if you didn't choose me back."

"That's terrifying."

"Yeah." Eben's chest rose and fell beneath Noel's cheek. "It is."

They sat in silence for a while, just breathing together, letting the weight of the last few days settle into something manageable. Something they could carry together instead of struggling under alone.

"I'm sorry," Eben said eventually. "For what I said. For making you think I didn't want this."

"I'm sorry too," Noel said. "For not finishing the sentence. For letting you think I only needed you to be useful."

"We're both idiots."

"Wes said the same thing."

Eben laughed, the sound rumbling through his chest. "Of course he did. He's been giving me pointed looks for days. I'm pretty sure he was about to stage an intervention if we didn't figure it out ourselves."

Noel shifted, pulling back just enough to look at Eben's face. "What happens now?"

"Now?" Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's cheek, his thumb brushing over Noel's cheekbone with a tenderness that made Noel's chest ache. "Now we figure it out. Together."

"That's not a plan."

"No," Eben agreed. "It's not. But it's a start."

Noel thought about that—about starting over, about building something new from the wreckage of what they'd almost lost. About choosing each other, every day, without guarantees.

It was terrifying.

It was also the only thing he wanted.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay?"

"Okay." Noel leaned in, kissing Eben soft and slow. "Let's start."

### POV: EBEN

They talked for hours.

Not about logistics or plans or what the future looked like in concrete terms. Just... talked. About fear and want and all the ways they'd both been trying to protect themselves by pushing the other away. About Eben's belief that everyone leaves and Noel's belief that he had to earn love through service. About the ways they'd hurt each other and the ways they wanted to do better.

It wasn't easy. There were moments when Eben wanted to retreat, to pull back into the safety of silence, to build up walls again. Moments when Noel's voice went tight with old pain, when the conversation touched on wounds that hadn't fully healed.

But they kept going. Because this—this honesty, this vulnerability, this willingness to be seen in all their broken, messy, imperfect glory—was what repair looked like. Not perfect. Not painless. But real.

"I don't know how to do this," Noel admitted at one point, his voice small. "I don't know how to be in a relationship where I'm not constantly trying to prove I'm worth keeping."

"Then we'll figure it out together," Eben said. "I don't know how to do this either. I don't know how to stay without waiting for the other shoe to drop. But I want to learn."

"With me?"

"With you."

Noel's smile was tentative but real. "Okay."

The sun was setting by the time they ran out of words, the apartment bathed in the soft golden light of late afternoon. Orange and pink streaked across the sky outside the window, and the snow on the rooftops glowed like it had been touched with fire.

Eben looked at Noel—really looked at him, taking in the exhaustion around his eyes, the way he was still holding himself a little too carefully, like he was afraid of breaking—and felt something settle in his chest.

This was what he wanted. This person, this moment, this messy, complicated, terrifying thing they were building together.

"Stay for dinner," Noel said, and it wasn't a question.

"I'm staying," Eben said. "For dinner. For tonight. For as long as you'll have me."

Noel's eyes went bright. "That's a long time."

"Good."

They ordered takeout—Thai food from the place on Main Street that Noel loved and Eben had never tried. They ate on the couch, legs tangled together, and talked about nothing important: the festival, the weather, the ridiculous number of pipers who'd shown up for today's performance. Normal things. Easy things.

It felt like coming home.

Later, when the food was gone and the containers were in the trash and the apartment had gone dark except for the glow of the streetlights outside, Noel turned to Eben and said: "Stay tonight?"

Eben's heart kicked in his chest. "Are you sure?"

"I'm sure." Noel's hand found his, fingers lacing together. "I don't want to wake up alone tomorrow."

"Okay," Eben said. "I'll stay."

They moved to the bedroom—not frantic, not desperate, just... together. Eben watched Noel move through the space, turning on the bedside lamp, pulling back the covers, and thought about how many times he'd imagined this. How many times he'd told himself it was impossible.

And now here he was. Choosing it. Choosing him.

"Come here," Noel said, and Eben went.

They lay down together, Noel's head on Eben's chest, Eben's arm around Noel's shoulders. The fit of it was perfect—like they'd been designed to slot together like this, like this was where they were always meant to end up.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly. "For choosing me."

"Thank you for letting me," Eben replied.

They fell asleep like that, wrapped around each other, and for the first time in weeks, Eben didn't dream about leaving.
