# Chapter 2
## POV: Dual (Noel → Eben)

### POV: NOEL

The Garland Cup smelled like cinnamon and desperation.

Noel pushed through the door, the bell chiming overhead with its familiar, cheerful jingle, and immediately regretted every decision that had led him here. The café was packed—last-minute shoppers clutching shopping bags, festival volunteers in their matching red scarves, tourists who'd decided that Christmas Eve in a small town was exactly the kind of wholesome experience they needed to post about. The noise hit him like a wall: laughter, conversation, the hiss of the espresso machine, the clatter of cups on saucers, all of it blending into a cacophony that made his skull ache.

The air was thick with the scent of fresh-baked pastries and spiced lattes, and any other day Noel would have found it comforting. Today it just reminded him that Christmas was supposed to feel warm and welcoming, and he felt neither.

He should have stayed home.

"You look like roadkill."

Noel turned. Wes stood behind the counter, arms crossed over his flour-dusted apron, his expression somewhere between concern and exasperation. His dark hair was pulled back in its usual messy knot, and there was a smear of what looked like buttercream on his cheek that he either didn't know about or didn't care about.

"Thanks," Noel said flatly. "Really needed that this morning."

"I'm serious." Wes leaned forward, lowering his voice just enough that the customers wouldn't hear. "You look like you haven't slept in a week. Which, knowing you, you probably haven't. Your under-eye circles have under-eye circles."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You're miserable." Wes's brown eyes narrowed. "And before you try to deflect—" He held up a hand, cutting off Noel's automatic protest. "—I'm not letting you. Not today. I've watched you mope around this town for two days, and I'm done pretending I don't see it."

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it. Tried again. "Wes—"

"He's miserable too, you know." Wes's voice was gentler now, but no less direct. "Eben. He looks like someone kicked his dog. Except he doesn't have a dog, so I'm pretty sure the thing he's mourning is you."

The words landed like a punch to the sternum. Noel swallowed hard, his throat suddenly tight. "I don't—"

"Stop being idiots," Wes said, not unkindly. "Both of you. Whatever happened, whatever got said—fix it. It's Christmas Eve, Noel. You don't get to spend it wallowing in separate corners of town like a pair of lovesick teenagers who don't know how to use their words."

"It's not that simple."

"It never is." Wes straightened, grabbing a to-go cup and scribbling something on it with a Sharpie. "But you know what's worse than trying and failing? Not trying at all. And I've watched you not try for days now, and honestly? It's exhausting. For everyone. The whole town can feel you two pining from opposite ends of Main Street."

He shoved the cup across the counter. Noel took it automatically, glancing down at the label. In Wes's messy handwriting, it read: *Noel—Stop Being Tragic*.

Despite everything, a laugh bubbled up in his chest. It wasn't a happy laugh, but it was something. "Subtle."

"I don't do subtle. I do effective." Wes's expression softened just a fraction, something almost tender flickering in his eyes. "Talk to him, Noel. Please. The whole town is rooting for you two, and honestly, watching you both mope around is exhausting. Some of us have holiday baking to do."

Noel stared at the cup in his hands, the warmth seeping into his palms. The coffee smelled like vanilla and hope, two things he wasn't sure he deserved right now. "What if he doesn't want to?"

"Then you'll know," Wes said simply. "But I don't think that's the problem. I think you're both too scared to admit you're scared. And that's—" He waved a hand. "That's just sad, honestly. So go. Fix it. Before I have to watch you tragically drink that latte in the corner like a Victorian widow."

### POV: EBEN

Eben was halfway through his third lap around the town square when Sam appeared out of nowhere and blocked his path.

"You look like you made a mistake," Sam said without preamble, his breath misting in the cold air. He was in his deputy uniform, hands shoved in his pockets, his expression the kind of patient exasperation that suggested he'd been waiting for this moment. "Fix it."

Eben stopped short, his own breath coming fast from the walking—or maybe from the way his chest had been tight for days. "Excuse me?"

"You heard me." Sam crossed his arms, the gesture so reminiscent of Wes that Eben would have laughed if he weren't so tired. They'd been married long enough that their mannerisms had started to blend together. "Whatever you did—and I'm guessing it was something stupid, because you've got that look—fix it."

"I'm trying," Eben said, the words coming out sharper than he intended. He'd been walking for an hour, trying to clear his head, trying to figure out what to say, and all he'd accomplished was making his feet cold and his thoughts more tangled. "It's not—"

"Try harder." Sam's voice was firm but not unkind. "It's Christmas Eve, Frost. You don't get to spend it like this—walking circles around the square like a ghost haunting the place where you screwed up. And more importantly, Noel doesn't deserve to spend it like this either."

The use of his last name—formal, pointed—made something twist in Eben's chest. "I know."

"Do you?" Sam stepped closer, his expression serious. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're doing that thing you do. The thing where you decide something's impossible before you even try. Where you convince yourself the door's already closed so you don't have to be brave enough to knock."

Eben wanted to argue. Wanted to say that Sam didn't understand, that it was more complicated than that, that he'd already tried and failed and made everything worse by opening his stupid mouth and saying the worst possible thing. But the words stuck in his throat, because Sam was right.

He was always right. It was infuriating.

"What if I already ruined it?" Eben asked quietly.

"Then you apologize," Sam said, like it was the simplest thing in the world. "You apologize, and you mean it, and you let him decide what happens next. But you don't get to make that decision for him, Eben. That's not fair, and you know it."

Eben closed his eyes, the cold air burning in his lungs. "I don't know if I can—"

"You can." Sam's hand landed on his shoulder, solid and grounding. "And you will. Because the alternative is spending the rest of your life wondering what would have happened if you'd been brave enough to try. And trust me—" He squeezed once, then let go. "—that's a hell of a lot worse than rejection."

### POV: NOEL

Noel was still standing in the Garland Cup, staring at his coffee cup like it held the answers to the universe, when Hugh appeared at his elbow.

"Stop being tragic," Hugh said mildly, echoing the label on Noel's cup. "It doesn't suit you."

Noel blinked at him. Hugh Everhart was wearing a sweater covered in actual glitter—because of course he was—and his silver hair was artfully tousled in a way that suggested he'd spent far more time on it than he'd ever admit. "Did Wes put you up to this?"

"No one puts me up to anything. I'm a free agent." Hugh smiled, the expression warm and knowing. "But I am going to tell you the same thing I told Eben ten minutes ago: talk to each other. You're both miserable. The whole town knows it. And frankly, we're all exhausted from watching you two dance around each other like you're auditioning for a very sad ballet."

"You talked to Eben?"

"I did. Ran into him on my way here, looking like a man who'd lost something precious and didn't know how to get it back." Hugh's smile faded into something more serious. "Whatever happened between you two, it's not unsalvageable. But it will be if you keep avoiding it. Wounds fester when you ignore them. You of all people should know that."

Noel's chest felt too tight. "What if he doesn't want to fix it?"

"Then you'll know," Hugh said, the same words Wes had used. "But I don't think that's the problem. I think you're both scared. And that's okay—being scared is human. But letting fear make your decisions for you?" He shook his head, something almost sad in his eyes. "That's just a recipe for regret."

He clapped Noel on the shoulder, gentle but firm, and walked away before Noel could respond.

Noel stood there, surrounded by the noise and warmth of the café, and thought about what it meant to be brave.

### POV: EBEN

Eben walked into Merryweather Hall with a plan.

The plan was simple: find Noel. Talk to him. Apologize. Try to fix what he'd broken with his own cowardly, desperate words.

The plan did not account for the sheer chaos of Christmas Eve setup, or the fact that Noel was apparently everywhere and nowhere all at once. Eben spotted him across the hall directing a group of volunteers, then lost him behind a massive pile of chair covers. Caught a glimpse of him near the stage adjusting a microphone stand, then watched him disappear through a side door. It was like trying to catch smoke.

Eventually, Eben stopped trying to intercept him and just... watched. Stood in the doorway and let himself look at the man he'd been trying not to think about for two days.

Noel looked exhausted. The kind of bone-deep tired that no amount of coffee could fix. But he was still moving, still smiling, still holding the whole event together through sheer force of will and the kind of stubborn determination that Eben had always admired about him.

Something cracked open in Eben's chest.

He'd done this. He'd made Noel look like that—worn down, guarded, running on fumes. Because he'd been too scared to admit what he wanted, so he'd said the cruelest thing he could think of instead.

Sam was right. Hugh was right. Hell, even Wes was probably right, and they hadn't even spoken.

Eben had to try.

He crossed the hall, weaving through volunteers and tables and garlands of fake pine, until he was close enough to speak. "Noel."

Noel turned, and for a moment, his expression was unguarded—surprise, hope, fear, all flickering across his face before he locked it down into something carefully neutral. "Eben."

"Can we talk?"

The question hung between them, fragile and weighted.

Noel's jaw tightened. "About what?"

"About what I said." Eben forced himself to hold Noel's gaze, even though every instinct screamed at him to look away. "About what I meant."

Silence. Noel didn't move, didn't speak, just waited. Not helping. Not making this easy.

Good. Eben didn't deserve easy.

"I panicked," he said, the words rough in his throat.

"You said it was never supposed to last." Noel's voice was quiet, but the words hit like a slap. "You said this was never supposed to be real."

Eben flinched. "I lied."

The admission hung in the air between them. Noel's expression shifted—not forgiveness, not yet, but something softer. Listening. Waiting for more.

"Not here," Noel said finally, his voice low. "Too many people. Too many ears."

Eben nodded. "Okay."

Noel glanced around, then jerked his head toward the back hallway. "Come on."

They found a storage room—small, cluttered with boxes of decorations and stacks of folding chairs, lit by a single overhead bulb that cast harsh shadows. The door clicked shut behind them, and suddenly the noise of the hall was gone, replaced by a silence that felt too loud.

Noel leaned against the wall, arms crossed, waiting.

Eben took a breath.

"I need to explain," he said.

"Then explain."

And so he did.
