# Chapter 6
## POV: Noel

The festival ended at sunset.

Noel stood at the edge of Merryweather Hall, watching the final performance wind down—eleven pipers in full regalia, their kilts swaying as they played, their music bright and clear in the cold evening air. The crowd was entranced, faces lit with wonder and the warm glow of a thousand string lights, and Noel felt a swell of pride that had nothing to do with logistics or planning.

They'd done it. Twelve days of chaos, of impossible deadlines and last-minute disasters and sponsors who kept changing their minds. Twelve days of barely holding it together. And they'd actually pulled it off.

The final note of the pipers' song hung in the air for a moment, pure and perfect, before the crowd erupted into applause. Noel clapped along, feeling something ease in his chest for the first time in weeks. It was over. The festival was over.

And somehow, miraculously, he hadn't lost everything in the process.

Eben appeared at his elbow, close enough that their shoulders brushed. "You okay?"

"Yeah." Noel turned to look at him, taking in the soft expression on Eben's face—the way his eyes crinkled at the corners, the way he was looking at Noel like he was something precious. "I'm good. Just... processing."

"It's a lot."

"It is." Noel glanced back at the performance, then back at Eben. "We did it."

"We did." Eben's hand found his, their fingers lacing together. The touch was warm, grounding. Public, in a way it hadn't been before. "You held this whole thing together, Noel. You should be proud."

"I didn't do it alone." Noel squeezed his hand. "Couldn't have done it without you."

Eben smiled—that small, private smile that made Noel's chest ache. "You would have figured it out."

"Maybe. But it would have been a lot harder." Noel hesitated, then added: "And a lot lonelier."

They stood there for a moment, watching the crowd begin to shift as people prepared for the closing ceremony. The sky had gone from orange to purple, stars beginning to peek through the clouds. The air smelled like cinnamon and woodsmoke and the particular magic of Christmas Eve.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly. "For staying."

"Thank you for letting me." Eben's thumb traced a circle on the back of Noel's hand. "I know I made it hard."

"We both made it hard." Noel leaned into him, just slightly—enough to feel the warmth of Eben's body against his side. "But we figured it out."

"Yeah." Eben pressed a kiss to Noel's temple, quick and soft. "We did."

Around them, the crowd was moving toward Evergreen Square for the tree lighting. The final event. The last moment of the Twelve Days Festival before Christmas arrived in earnest.

"Come on," Noel said, tugging Eben's hand. "We should be there for this."

"Lead the way."

### The Closing Ceremony

The massive Christmas tree dominated Evergreen Square, dark for now but waiting—a promise of light about to be fulfilled.

Noel stood at the edge of the crowd, watching the final speech—Mayor Kringle in his element, all beaming smiles and grand gestures—and felt something settle in his chest. This was the moment. The culmination of everything they'd worked for.

Eben was beside him, their hands linked, and Noel felt a swell of something he couldn't quite name.

Gratitude, maybe. Or relief. Or just... happiness. The kind of simple, uncomplicated happiness he'd almost forgotten how to feel.

"You did good," Eben murmured, his voice low enough that only Noel could hear.

"We did good," Noel corrected.

Eben smiled. "Yeah. We did."

The crowd erupted into applause as the tree blazed to life, the light cascading down from the star at the top to the lowest branches, bathing everyone in a warm golden glow. Noel watched it for a moment, then turned to look at Eben—really look at him, taking in the soft expression on his face, the way he was watching the tree with something like wonder.

The words came without planning. Without rehearsal. Just—truth.

"I love you," Noel said.

Eben's head whipped around, his eyes wide. "What?"

Noel's heart was pounding, adrenaline spiking through his veins, but he didn't take it back. He'd spent too long not saying the things that mattered. "I love you. I'm in love with you. And I know it's fast, and I know we just—but I can't not say it anymore."

Eben kissed him, cutting off the rambling. It was soft and sweet and full of promise, and when he pulled back, his eyes were bright with something that looked a lot like tears.

"I love you too," Eben said, his voice rough with emotion. "I'm in love with you, Noel."

Noel's breath caught. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." Eben's hand came up to cup his face, thumb brushing over his cheekbone. "I'm staying. I'm choosing you. And I love you."

Noel kissed him again, and this time it was deeper, more certain, like they were both finally letting themselves believe this was real. Around them, the crowd cheered—for the tree, for the festival, for the magic of Christmas Eve in a small town. But Noel barely heard it. All he could focus on was Eben, and the way Eben was looking at him like he was everything.

"Come home with me," Noel said when they finally pulled apart.

Eben smiled. "I thought you'd never ask."

They slipped away from the crowd, hand in hand, and walked back to Noel's apartment through the quiet streets. The festival was over. The twelve days were done. But this—this thing they were building—was just beginning.

And for the first time in a long time, Noel wasn't scared of what came next.

He was ready for it.
