# Chapter 1
## POV: Noel

Noel woke alone on Christmas Eve.

The bed was wrong. It had been wrong for days now—too wide, too cold, the silence where Eben's breathing should have been like a physical ache in his chest. He lay there for a long moment, staring at the ceiling, watching the pale winter light creep across the plaster in slow, indifferent bands. The radiator clicked and hummed in the corner, the only sound in an apartment that felt hollow without another heartbeat in it.

Two days. That's how long it had been since Eben had looked at him across Merryweather Hall and said the words that had cracked something open in Noel's chest: *This was never supposed to last.*

Noel closed his eyes, but the memory was right there, waiting for him. The shock of it. The way his whole body had gone cold, like someone had dumped ice water down his spine. The desperate, scrambling need to hold his face steady, to not let Eben see how much it hurt, because if he fell apart in front of everyone—

He hadn't fallen apart. He'd smiled. He'd nodded. He'd said something—he couldn't even remember what—and then he'd walked away on legs that felt like they belonged to someone else, and he'd kept walking until he was alone in the storage room behind the stage, and only then had he let himself sink to the floor and press his palms against his eyes until the world stopped spinning.

Two days of pretending everything was fine. Two days of running the festival on autopilot, plastering on his best *everything's under control* smile while something inside him bled quietly where no one could see. Two days of waking up alone in this too-big bed, reaching for a warmth that wasn't there anymore.

He couldn't do it anymore.

Noel sat up slowly, his bare feet cold against the hardwood floor. The apartment was quiet—too quiet, the kind of silence that made you aware of your own heartbeat, the soft hiss of your own breathing. He looked around the room: the clothes he'd left draped over the chair, the half-empty coffee mug on the nightstand from two days ago, the small pile of festival paperwork he'd been ignoring because every time he looked at it, he thought of Eben.

The ribbon caught his eye. Red velvet, tied loosely around his left wrist, fraying at the edges now. Eben had given it to him during the craft fair—a joke, or so Eben had claimed, plucking it from a display of holiday ribbons and tying it around Noel's wrist with those careful, precise fingers. *"So you don't forget which wrist is left,"* he'd said, deadpan, and Noel had laughed, and for a moment everything had been simple and warm and good.

He should have taken it off days ago. He hadn't.

He couldn't.

Noel stood, padding across the cold floor to the window. Outside, Tinsel Town was dressed up for Christmas Eve—fresh snow blanketing the rooftops, lights twinkling in the windows, the town square visible in the distance with its massive tree already lit and ready for tonight's closing ceremony. It looked like a postcard. It looked like a promise. The whole town seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for something magical to happen.

Maybe it would. Maybe it wouldn't. Either way, Noel was done waiting for someone else to make the first move.

He thought about the ice rink. The moment on the ice, weeks ago now, when he'd tried to say something to Eben—something real, something true, something that had been building in his chest for days. *I need—*

And then the interruption. The crowd. The fear that had choked the words back down his throat before he could finish them.

*I need you.*

That's what he'd been trying to say. Not *I need your help* or *I need you to stay for the festival* or any of the thousand safe, useful things he could have meant. Just: *I need you.*

He'd never finished the sentence. And Eben had never asked him to.

But today was different. Today was the last day of the festival—the final event, the closing ceremony, the grand finale that would wrap twelve days of chaos and wonder into a neat bow and send everyone home happy. After tonight, there would be no more excuses. No more *we'll talk after the festival.* No more hiding behind logistics and schedules and the convenient fiction that they were both just too busy to deal with what had broken between them.

If Noel didn't say something today, he never would.

The thought terrified him. The thought of walking up to Eben and finishing that sentence, of laying himself bare and risking—what? Rejection? He'd already been rejected. Eben had made that clear enough. *This was never supposed to last.*

But what if Eben had been lying?

The thought slipped in unbidden, dangerous and hopeful.

What if Eben had been scared too?

Noel pressed his palm flat against the cold window glass, watching his breath fog against it. He didn't know if Eben had been lying. He didn't know if any of this was salvageable. But he knew one thing with absolute certainty: he couldn't spend the rest of his life wondering what would have happened if he'd been brave enough to try.

He showered with intention, not performance. The water was hot, almost scalding, and he stood under it for a long time, letting the heat seep into his bones, letting the steam fill his lungs. By the time he stepped out, something in his chest had shifted—not healed, not fixed, but... ready. Ready to face whatever came next.

He dressed in clothes that felt like himself—a soft sweater in deep green, jeans that actually fit, comfortable shoes for a day that would probably involve a lot of standing and walking and trying not to fall apart. He looked at himself in the mirror and saw someone who looked exhausted but determined. Someone who was about to do something terrifying.

The ribbon was still around his wrist. He ran his fingers over it one more time, considered taking it off, and decided against it.

If he was going to do this—if he was going to show up and finish the sentence he'd started weeks ago—he was going to do it honestly. No armor. No scripts. Just him, and the truth, and whatever happened after.

The festival would end tonight. The twelve days of Christmas would be over. But Noel was done using either of those things as an excuse.

He grabbed his coat from the hook by the door, his keys from the bowl on the table, and walked out into the December morning before he could talk himself out of it.

The cold hit him like a slap—sharp and clean and bracing. Fresh snow crunched under his boots as he made his way toward Main Street, his breath misting in the air. The town was already stirring, early risers heading to the Garland Cup for coffee, volunteers making last-minute preparations for tonight's events.

Somewhere out there, Eben was probably doing the same thing. Going through the motions. Pretending everything was fine.

*Not anymore,* Noel thought. *Not today.*

Today, he was going to be brave. Whatever that cost him.
