# Chapter 8
## POV: Dual (Noel leads)

### POV: NOEL

Noel fell asleep on Christmas Eve with Eben's arm around him and thought: *This is what staying feels like.*

It felt like warmth. Like safety. Like coming home after a long journey and finding the door unlocked, the lights on, someone waiting for you inside.

It felt like Eben's heartbeat under his ear, steady and sure. Like the weight of Eben's arm across his waist, grounding him. Like the soft press of Eben's lips against his temple before they'd both drifted off—a wordless promise.

It felt like hope.

Outside, snow fell softly over Tinsel Town. The festival lights still glowed along Main Street, one last night before the decorations came down. The massive tree in Evergreen Square still sparkled, though the square itself was empty now, everyone home for Christmas.

Inside Noel's apartment, wrapped in Eben's arms, the two days of heartbreak felt like a distant memory. Not forgotten—never forgotten, because they'd learned from it—but healed. Stitched together with honesty and vulnerability and the kind of brave, terrifying love that came from choosing each other anyway.

Noel had spent so long believing that love was something you earned. Something you had to work for, every day, through service and usefulness and never asking for anything in return.

But this—this thing with Eben—wasn't like that.

It was messy and complicated and sometimes scary, but it was also real. It was choosing each other, not because they had to, but because they wanted to. It was staying, even when it was hard. It was being brave enough to be vulnerable.

It was love.

And for the first time in a long time, Noel let himself believe he deserved it.

### POV: EBEN

Eben lay awake for a while after Noel fell asleep, listening to the rhythm of his breathing in the dark.

The apartment was quiet. The snow had muffled everything—the distant sounds of the town, the occasional car passing on the street, even the hum of the radiator seemed softer. The only thing Eben could hear clearly was Noel, warm and solid against his side, finally at peace.

He thought about the last twelve days. The chaos and the crises and the constant, low-grade panic of keeping a festival from falling apart. The gradual, terrifying realization that he was falling for someone in a way he'd never let himself fall before.

The moment he'd almost ruined everything.

And the moment Noel had let him try again.

*I'm staying,* Eben thought, the words settling into his chest like a vow. *I'm choosing this. I'm choosing him.*

It was still terrifying. Probably always would be—that fear didn't disappear just because you decided to be brave. But it was getting easier. Every hour they spent together, every moment of vulnerability they shared, the fear got a little smaller and the hope got a little bigger.

Tomorrow was Christmas. Tomorrow they'd wake up together and figure out what the next chapter looked like. Tomorrow, the festival would officially be over, and they'd have to navigate the reality of building a relationship without the convenient excuse of professional proximity.

But tonight—tonight, on Christmas Eve, in this quiet apartment with snow falling outside and Noel sleeping peacefully in his arms—Eben let himself just be present. Just be grateful. Just be here.

He pressed a kiss to Noel's hair, breathing in the familiar scent of him.

"I love you," he whispered, even though Noel couldn't hear him. It felt important to say it. To put the words out into the universe, even in the dark.

Noel stirred slightly, pressing closer in his sleep, and Eben smiled.

Tomorrow would bring whatever it brought. But tonight, they had this.

It was enough.

It was more than enough.

Eben closed his eyes and let sleep take him, and for the first time in longer than he could remember, he didn't dream about leaving.

He dreamed about staying.
