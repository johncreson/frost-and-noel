## BLURB

He's coming back.

Not because it's easy. Not because it's the smart choice. But because Eben Frost finally understands something he's been running from his entire life:

Some things are worth staying for.

When his car pulls into Tinsel Town on day eleven, Noel isn't waiting. Noel is at the festival, doing what he always does—holding everything together, pretending he's fine, refusing to hope.

Eben has to find him. Has to apologize. Has to prove that this time, "staying" isn't just a word.

The conversation that follows is the hardest thing either of them has ever done.

But repair is possible. Forgiveness is possible. And maybe—just maybe—the man who never stayed can learn to build something permanent.

**Day eleven of twelve. Repair begins with showing up.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring reunion, relationship repair, grumpy-sunshine dynamics, explicit heat, and a guaranteed HEA.*
