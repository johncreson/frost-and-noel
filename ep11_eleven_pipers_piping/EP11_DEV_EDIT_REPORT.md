**Analysis Date:** December 30, 2024

## PASS 1: Technical & Structural Analysis

### Critical Issues Found

#### 1. Meta-References in Prose (CRITICAL)
Several chapters contain out-of-universe references that break immersion:
- **Chapter 1, Line 14:** "The moment on the ice in EP7" — should be "The moment on the ice weeks ago" or similar
- **Chapter 4, Line 22:** "In EP7" — should reference the scene naturally
- **Chapter 6, Line 30:** "In EP7" — same issue
- **Chapter 8, Line 24:** "echoing the outline's beat" — meta-reference to outline

#### 2. Town Name Inconsistency (CRITICAL)
- **Draft uses:** "Frostwick"
- **Series Bible says:** "Tinsel Town"
- **Resolution:** All instances of "Frostwick" must be changed to "Tinsel Town"

#### 3. Word Count Gaps
| Chapter | Current | Target | Gap |
|---------|---------|--------|-----|
| Ch 1 | ~470 | 1,350 | -880 |
| Ch 2 | ~1,420 | 1,650 | -230 |
| Ch 3 | ~1,320 | 1,650 | -330 |
| Ch 4 | ~1,850 | 2,250 | -400 |
| Ch 5 | ~1,850 | 1,750 | +100 ✓ |
| Ch 6 | ~1,320 | 1,750 | -430 |
| Ch 7 | ~1,450 | 2,750 | -1,300 |
| Ch 8 | ~2,050 | 1,100 | +950 ✓ |

### Structural Analysis

#### Plot Arc: ✓ STRONG
- Clear beginning (decision to be brave), middle (repair work), end (resolution)
- Central conflict (broken relationship) is compelling
- Resolution is satisfying and earned

#### Character Development: ✓ STRONG
- Both protagonists experience significant growth
- Core wounds are articulated: Eben (attachment = loss), Noel (love must be earned)
- Arc completion feels authentic

#### Pacing Issues
- Chapter 1 is too short for its emotional weight — needs expansion
- Chapter 7 needs much more content for the repair intimacy scene
- Chapter 8 has good length but could trim some repetition

## PASS 3: Style & Quality Checks

### Dialogue Analysis: ✓ STRONG
- Each character has distinct voice
- Wes is appropriately blunt and caring
- Sam is direct but kind
- Hugh is warm and knowing
- Eben and Noel's dialogue carries emotional weight

### POV Consistency: ✓ GOOD
- Clear POV markers in each section
- Dual POV chapters are well-handled
- No head-hopping issues

### Continuity Checks
- [x] Ribbon on wrist (Ch1, Ch4) — consistent
- [x] Contract decline (revealed Ch3, reinforced Ch4-5) — consistent
- [x] "I need you" sentence from EP7 — properly set up and paid off
- [x] "That okay counts" callback — used effectively
- [ ] **ISSUE:** Need to verify the exact scene from EP7 to ensure accurate callback

### Thematic Consistency: ✓ EXCELLENT
- "Staying" as active choice runs throughout
- "You don't have to earn love" is properly developed
- Repair vs rupture contrast is clear
- Found family support is integrated naturally

### Heat Level Check
Per series bible: "open-door explicit, 2-4 on-page scenes per episode"
- Current: 1 scene (Ch7)
- This is appropriate for this episode's focus on emotional repair
- Scene needs expansion but heat level is correct
