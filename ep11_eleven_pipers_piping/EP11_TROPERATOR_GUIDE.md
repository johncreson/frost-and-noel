Slow, reflective. This is the inhale before action.

### Style Suggestions

3. Eben struggling with words (growth under pressure)

3. **Proof Before Promise** — Action preceded words

### Style Suggestions
- Build to "I want you. I'm scared. I'm choosing you anyway."
- The contract reveal should feel earned, not theatrical
- "Say it again" = Noel asking to believe it
- The proof (contract) validates the words

**Vulnerability Exchange / Completion**

### Tropes (2-3)
1. **Finishing the Sentence** — Callback payoff

3. **Permission Through Touch** — Hand on face, gentle kiss

### Style Suggestions
- Noel POV for his vulnerability
- The unfinished sentence from EP7 explicitly completed
- "Because I'm better when you stay" = saying love without saying love
- Physical tenderness follows verbal vulnerability

### Tracked Elements
1. EP7 callback (on the ice, interrupted)
2. "Not to be useful" — wound inversion
3. "I'm staying" — declaration matched
4. The kiss as permission, not desperation

### Pacing
Release. The tension resolves into connection.

2. "I'm sorry" integrated naturally
