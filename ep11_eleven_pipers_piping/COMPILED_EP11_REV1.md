# Chapter 1
## POV: Noel

Noel woke alone on Christmas Eve.

The bed was wrong. It had been wrong for days nowâ€”too wide, too cold, the silence where Eben's breathing should have been like a physical ache in his chest. He lay there for a long moment, staring at the ceiling, watching the pale winter light creep across the plaster in slow, indifferent bands. The radiator clicked and hummed in the corner, the only sound in an apartment that felt hollow without another heartbeat in it.

Four days. That's how long it had been since Eben had looked at him across Merryweather Hall and said the words that had cracked something open in Noel's chest: *This was never supposed to last.*

Noel closed his eyes, but the memory was right there, waiting for him. The shock of it. The way his whole body had gone cold, like someone had dumped ice water down his spine. The desperate, scrambling need to hold his face steady, to not let Eben see how much it hurt, because if he fell apart in front of everyoneâ€”

He hadn't fallen apart. He'd smiled. He'd nodded. He'd said somethingâ€”he couldn't even remember whatâ€”and then he'd walked away on legs that felt like they belonged to someone else, and he'd kept walking until he was alone in the storage room behind the stage, and only then had he let himself sink to the floor and press his palms against his eyes until the world stopped spinning.

Four days of pretending everything was fine. Four days of running the festival on autopilot, plastering on his best *everything's under control* smile while something inside him bled quietly where no one could see. Four days of waking up alone in this too-big bed, reaching for a warmth that wasn't there anymore.

He couldn't do it anymore.

Noel sat up slowly, his bare feet cold against the hardwood floor. The apartment was quietâ€”too quiet, the kind of silence that made you aware of your own heartbeat, the soft hiss of your own breathing. He looked around the room: the clothes he'd left draped over the chair, the half-empty coffee mug on the nightstand from two days ago, the small pile of festival paperwork he'd been ignoring because every time he looked at it, he thought of Eben.

The ribbon caught his eye. Red velvet, tied loosely around his left wrist, fraying at the edges now. Eben had given it to him during the craft fairâ€”a joke, or so Eben had claimed, plucking it from a display of holiday ribbons and tying it around Noel's wrist with those careful, precise fingers. *"So you don't forget which wrist is left,"* he'd said, deadpan, and Noel had laughed, and for a moment everything had been simple and warm and good.

He should have taken it off days ago. He hadn't.

He couldn't.

Noel stood, padding across the cold floor to the window. Outside, Tinsel Town was dressed up for Christmas Eveâ€”fresh snow blanketing the rooftops, lights twinkling in the windows, the town square visible in the distance with its massive tree already lit and ready for tonight's closing ceremony. It looked like a postcard. It looked like a promise. The whole town seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for something magical to happen.

Maybe it would. Maybe it wouldn't. Either way, Noel was done waiting for someone else to make the first move.

He thought about the ice rink. The moment on the ice, weeks ago now, when he'd tried to say something to Ebenâ€”something real, something true, something that had been building in his chest for days. *I needâ€”*

And then the interruption. The crowd. The fear that had choked the words back down his throat before he could finish them.

*I need you.*

That's what he'd been trying to say. Not *I need your help* or *I need you to stay for the festival* or any of the thousand safe, useful things he could have meant. Just: *I need you.*

He'd never finished the sentence. And Eben had never asked him to.

But today was different. Today was the last day of the festivalâ€”the final event, the closing ceremony, the grand finale that would wrap twelve days of chaos and wonder into a neat bow and send everyone home happy. After tonight, there would be no more excuses. No more *we'll talk after the festival.* No more hiding behind logistics and schedules and the convenient fiction that they were both just too busy to deal with what had broken between them.

If Noel didn't say something today, he never would.

The thought terrified him. The thought of walking up to Eben and finishing that sentence, of laying himself bare and riskingâ€”what? Rejection? He'd already been rejected. Eben had made that clear enough. *This was never supposed to last.*

But what if Eben had been lying?

The thought slipped in unbidden, dangerous and hopeful.

What if Eben had been scared too?

Noel pressed his palm flat against the cold window glass, watching his breath fog against it. He didn't know if Eben had been lying. He didn't know if any of this was salvageable. But he knew one thing with absolute certainty: he couldn't spend the rest of his life wondering what would have happened if he'd been brave enough to try.

He showered with intention, not performance. The water was hot, almost scalding, and he stood under it for a long time, letting the heat seep into his bones, letting the steam fill his lungs. By the time he stepped out, something in his chest had shiftedâ€”not healed, not fixed, but... ready. Ready to face whatever came next.

He dressed in clothes that felt like himselfâ€”a soft sweater in deep green, jeans that actually fit, comfortable shoes for a day that would probably involve a lot of standing and walking and trying not to fall apart. He looked at himself in the mirror and saw someone who looked exhausted but determined. Someone who was about to do something terrifying.

The ribbon was still around his wrist. He ran his fingers over it one more time, considered taking it off, and decided against it.

If he was going to do thisâ€”if he was going to show up and finish the sentence he'd started weeks agoâ€”he was going to do it honestly. No armor. No scripts. Just him, and the truth, and whatever happened after.

The festival would end tonight. The twelve days of Christmas would be over. But Noel was done using either of those things as an excuse.

He grabbed his coat from the hook by the door, his keys from the bowl on the table, and walked out into the December morning before he could talk himself out of it.

The cold hit him like a slapâ€”sharp and clean and bracing. Fresh snow crunched under his boots as he made his way toward Main Street, his breath misting in the air. The town was already stirring, early risers heading to the Garland Cup for coffee, volunteers making last-minute preparations for tonight's events.

Somewhere out there, Eben was probably doing the same thing. Going through the motions. Pretending everything was fine.

*Not anymore,* Noel thought. *Not today.*

Today, he was going to be brave. Whatever that cost him.
# Chapter 2
## POV: Dual (Noel â†’ Eben)

### POV: NOEL

The Garland Cup smelled like cinnamon and desperation.

Noel pushed through the door, the bell chiming overhead with its familiar, cheerful jingle, and immediately regretted every decision that had led him here. The cafÃ© was packedâ€”last-minute shoppers clutching shopping bags, festival volunteers in their matching red scarves, tourists who'd decided that Christmas Eve in a small town was exactly the kind of wholesome experience they needed to post about. The noise hit him like a wall: laughter, conversation, the hiss of the espresso machine, the clatter of cups on saucers, all of it blending into a cacophony that made his skull ache.

The air was thick with the scent of fresh-baked pastries and spiced lattes, and any other day Noel would have found it comforting. Today it just reminded him that Christmas was supposed to feel warm and welcoming, and he felt neither.

He should have stayed home.

"You look like roadkill."

Noel turned. Wes stood behind the counter, arms crossed over his flour-dusted apron, his expression somewhere between concern and exasperation. His dark hair was pulled back in its usual messy knot, and there was a smear of what looked like buttercream on his cheek that he either didn't know about or didn't care about.

"Thanks," Noel said flatly. "Really needed that this morning."

"I'm serious." Wes leaned forward, lowering his voice just enough that the customers wouldn't hear. "You look like you haven't slept in a week. Which, knowing you, you probably haven't. Your under-eye circles have under-eye circles."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You're miserable." Wes's brown eyes narrowed. "And before you try to deflectâ€”" He held up a hand, cutting off Noel's automatic protest. "â€”I'm not letting you. Not today. I've watched you mope around this town for four days, and I'm done pretending I don't see it."

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it. Tried again. "Wesâ€”"

"He's miserable too, you know." Wes's voice was gentler now, but no less direct. "Eben. He looks like someone kicked his dog. Except he doesn't have a dog, so I'm pretty sure the thing he's mourning is you."

The words landed like a punch to the sternum. Noel swallowed hard, his throat suddenly tight. "I don'tâ€”"

"Stop being idiots," Wes said, not unkindly. "Both of you. Whatever happened, whatever got saidâ€”fix it. It's Christmas Eve, Noel. You don't get to spend it wallowing in separate corners of town like a pair of lovesick teenagers who don't know how to use their words."

"It's not that simple."

"It never is." Wes straightened, grabbing a to-go cup and scribbling something on it with a Sharpie. "But you know what's worse than trying and failing? Not trying at all. And I've watched you not try for days now, and honestly? It's exhausting. For everyone. The whole town can feel you two pining from opposite ends of Main Street."

He shoved the cup across the counter. Noel took it automatically, glancing down at the label. In Wes's messy handwriting, it read: *Noelâ€”Stop Being Tragic*.

Despite everything, a laugh bubbled up in his chest. It wasn't a happy laugh, but it was something. "Subtle."

"I don't do subtle. I do effective." Wes's expression softened just a fraction, something almost tender flickering in his eyes. "Talk to him, Noel. Please. The whole town is rooting for you two, and honestly, watching you both mope around is exhausting. Some of us have holiday baking to do."

Noel stared at the cup in his hands, the warmth seeping into his palms. The coffee smelled like vanilla and hope, two things he wasn't sure he deserved right now. "What if he doesn't want to?"

"Then you'll know," Wes said simply. "But I don't think that's the problem. I think you're both too scared to admit you're scared. And that'sâ€”" He waved a hand. "That's just sad, honestly. So go. Fix it. Before I have to watch you tragically drink that latte in the corner like a Victorian widow."

### POV: EBEN

Eben was halfway through his third lap around the town square when Sam appeared out of nowhere and blocked his path.

"You look like you made a mistake," Sam said without preamble, his breath misting in the cold air. He was in his deputy uniform, hands shoved in his pockets, his expression the kind of patient exasperation that suggested he'd been waiting for this moment. "Fix it."

Eben stopped short, his own breath coming fast from the walkingâ€”or maybe from the way his chest had been tight for days. "Excuse me?"

"You heard me." Sam crossed his arms, the gesture so reminiscent of Wes that Eben would have laughed if he weren't so tired. They'd been married long enough that their mannerisms had started to blend together. "Whatever you didâ€”and I'm guessing it was something stupid, because you've got that lookâ€”fix it."

"I'm trying," Eben said, the words coming out sharper than he intended. He'd been walking for an hour, trying to clear his head, trying to figure out what to say, and all he'd accomplished was making his feet cold and his thoughts more tangled. "It's notâ€”"

"Try harder." Sam's voice was firm but not unkind. "It's Christmas Eve, Frost. You don't get to spend it like thisâ€”walking circles around the square like a ghost haunting the place where you screwed up. And more importantly, Noel doesn't deserve to spend it like this either."

The use of his last nameâ€”formal, pointedâ€”made something twist in Eben's chest. "I know."

"Do you?" Sam stepped closer, his expression serious. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're doing that thing you do. The thing where you decide something's impossible before you even try. Where you convince yourself the door's already closed so you don't have to be brave enough to knock."

Eben wanted to argue. Wanted to say that Sam didn't understand, that it was more complicated than that, that he'd already tried and failed and made everything worse by opening his stupid mouth and saying the worst possible thing. But the words stuck in his throat, because Sam was right.

He was always right. It was infuriating.

"What if I already ruined it?" Eben asked quietly.

"Then you apologize," Sam said, like it was the simplest thing in the world. "You apologize, and you mean it, and you let him decide what happens next. But you don't get to make that decision for him, Eben. That's not fair, and you know it."

Eben closed his eyes, the cold air burning in his lungs. "I don't know if I canâ€”"

"You can." Sam's hand landed on his shoulder, solid and grounding. "And you will. Because the alternative is spending the rest of your life wondering what would have happened if you'd been brave enough to try. And trust meâ€”" He squeezed once, then let go. "â€”that's a hell of a lot worse than rejection."

### POV: NOEL

Noel was still standing in the Garland Cup, staring at his coffee cup like it held the answers to the universe, when Hugh appeared at his elbow.

"Stop being tragic," Hugh said mildly, echoing the label on Noel's cup. "It doesn't suit you."

Noel blinked at him. Hugh Everhart was wearing a sweater covered in actual glitterâ€”because of course he wasâ€”and his silver hair was artfully tousled in a way that suggested he'd spent far more time on it than he'd ever admit. "Did Wes put you up to this?"

"No one puts me up to anything. I'm a free agent." Hugh smiled, the expression warm and knowing. "But I am going to tell you the same thing I told Eben ten minutes ago: talk to each other. You're both miserable. The whole town knows it. And frankly, we're all exhausted from watching you two dance around each other like you're auditioning for a very sad ballet."

"You talked to Eben?"

"I did. Ran into him on my way here, looking like a man who'd lost something precious and didn't know how to get it back." Hugh's smile faded into something more serious. "Whatever happened between you two, it's not unsalvageable. But it will be if you keep avoiding it. Wounds fester when you ignore them. You of all people should know that."

Noel's chest felt too tight. "What if he doesn't want to fix it?"

"Then you'll know," Hugh said, the same words Wes had used. "But I don't think that's the problem. I think you're both scared. And that's okayâ€”being scared is human. But letting fear make your decisions for you?" He shook his head, something almost sad in his eyes. "That's just a recipe for regret."

He clapped Noel on the shoulder, gentle but firm, and walked away before Noel could respond.

Noel stood there, surrounded by the noise and warmth of the cafÃ©, and thought about what it meant to be brave.

---

### POV: EBEN

Eben walked into Merryweather Hall with a plan.

The plan was simple: find Noel. Talk to him. Apologize. Try to fix what he'd broken with his own cowardly, desperate words.

The plan did not account for the sheer chaos of Christmas Eve setup, or the fact that Noel was apparently everywhere and nowhere all at once. Eben spotted him across the hall directing a group of volunteers, then lost him behind a massive pile of chair covers. Caught a glimpse of him near the stage adjusting a microphone stand, then watched him disappear through a side door. It was like trying to catch smoke.

Eventually, Eben stopped trying to intercept him and just... watched. Stood in the doorway and let himself look at the man he'd been trying not to think about for four days.

Noel looked exhausted. The kind of bone-deep tired that no amount of coffee could fix. But he was still moving, still smiling, still holding the whole event together through sheer force of will and the kind of stubborn determination that Eben had always admired about him.

Something cracked open in Eben's chest.

He'd done this. He'd made Noel look like thatâ€”worn down, guarded, running on fumes. Because he'd been too scared to admit what he wanted, so he'd said the cruelest thing he could think of instead.

Sam was right. Hugh was right. Hell, even Wes was probably right, and they hadn't even spoken.

Eben had to try.

He crossed the hall, weaving through volunteers and tables and garlands of fake pine, until he was close enough to speak. "Noel."

Noel turned, and for a moment, his expression was unguardedâ€”surprise, hope, fear, all flickering across his face before he locked it down into something carefully neutral. "Eben."

"Can we talk?"

The question hung between them, fragile and weighted.

Noel's jaw tightened. "About what?"

"About what I said." Eben forced himself to hold Noel's gaze, even though every instinct screamed at him to look away. "About what I meant."

Silence. Noel didn't move, didn't speak, just waited. Not helping. Not making this easy.

Good. Eben didn't deserve easy.

"I panicked," he said, the words rough in his throat.

"You said it was never supposed to last." Noel's voice was quiet, but the words hit like a slap. "You said this was never supposed to be real."

Eben flinched. "I lied."

The admission hung in the air between them. Noel's expression shiftedâ€”not forgiveness, not yet, but something softer. Listening. Waiting for more.

"Not here," Noel said finally, his voice low. "Too many people. Too many ears."

Eben nodded. "Okay."

Noel glanced around, then jerked his head toward the back hallway. "Come on."

They found a storage roomâ€”small, cluttered with boxes of decorations and stacks of folding chairs, lit by a single overhead bulb that cast harsh shadows. The door clicked shut behind them, and suddenly the noise of the hall was gone, replaced by a silence that felt too loud.

Noel leaned against the wall, arms crossed, waiting.

Eben took a breath.

"I need to explain," he said.

"Then explain."

And so he did.
# Chapter 3
## POV: Eben

The storage room smelled like dust and old tinsel and something vaguely floralâ€”probably from the dried flower arrangements stacked in the corner.

Eben stood in the middle of it, acutely aware of how small the space was, how close Noel was, how there was nowhere to hide from this conversation. The single overhead bulb cast harsh shadows, making Noel's face difficult to read, but Eben could see the tension in his shoulders, the way he held himself like he was bracing for impact.

Like he expected Eben to hurt him again.

Fair. Eben had earned that.

"I need to explain," Eben said again, because he didn't know how else to start. The words felt inadequate, but they were all he had.

"Then explain." Noel's voice was flat, carefully neutral. Not helping. Not making this easy.

Eben deserved that too.

He took a breath, trying to organize the chaos in his head into something coherent. He'd spent four days trying to figure out what to say, and now that the moment was here, every rehearsed speech had evaporated, leaving him with nothing but raw, terrifying honesty.

"When I said... what I said. About this never being supposed to last." He forced the words out past the tightness in his throat. "I didn't mean it."

"You said it, though."

"I know." Eben's hands clenched at his sides, fingernails digging into his palms. "I know I did. And I can't take it back. But I need you to understandâ€”I didn't mean it. I was scared, and Iâ€”"

"Scared of what?" Noel pushed off the wall, taking a step closer. His eyes were too bright, his voice too controlled, like he was holding himself together through sheer force of will. "Scared of me? Scared of this? What were you so scared of that you had toâ€”"

He cut himself off, jaw tight, and Eben saw the moment Noel decided not to finish that sentence. Decided not to give voice to how much it had hurt.

*Scared of what you had to destroy us?*

That's what he'd been about to say. Eben could hear it in the silence between them.

"Scared of wanting you to stay," Eben said quietly.

The words fell into the silence like stones into water. Noel went very still.

"I've spent my whole life believing that attachment ends in loss," Eben continued, forcing himself to keep going even though every instinct screamed at him to stop, to retreat, to protect himself the way he always had. "Everyone leaves. Everyone moves on. That's just... that's how it works. My mother left when I was six. My father checked out emotionally long before he died. Every relationship I've ever had has ended the same wayâ€”with me watching someone walk away and wondering what I did wrong."

Noel's expression shiftedâ€”something complicated flickering across his face. Not forgiveness. Not yet. But understanding, maybe. Or at least the beginning of it.

"So I learned not to get attached," Eben said. "Not to want people to stay. Because wanting them to stay just makes it hurt more when they go. And I was good at it. I was so good at keeping people at arm's length, at making sure I could walk away first if I needed to. And then youâ€”"

His voice cracked. He swallowed hard, tried again.

"You made me want you to stay. And I didn't know what to do with that." He met Noel's eyes, held them, even though it felt like standing in front of a firing squad. "So when you started talking about the future, about what happens after the festival, I panicked. I felt the walls closing in, and I couldn't breathe, and I saidâ€”"

"The worst thing you could think of," Noel finished, his voice softer now.

"Yeah." The admission burned in Eben's throat. "To make you leave first. Before you couldâ€”"

"Before I could leave on my own."

"Yeah."

The silence stretched between them, heavy with everything unsaid. Eben could hear his own heartbeat, too loud in the quiet space, could feel the sweat on his palms and the tremor in his hands that he was desperately trying to hide.

"That doesn't make it okay," Noel said finally.

"I know." Eben met his eyes, held his gaze. "I'm not asking you to forget it. I'm not asking you to pretend it didn't happen. I justâ€”"

He stopped. Started over.

"I'm asking if you can believe I didn't mean it."

Noel looked at him for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then: "What do you want, Eben?"

The use of his first name landed like permission. Like an opening. Like maybe, just maybe, there was still a chance to fix this.

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Tried to find the words for something he'd never let himself want before.

"I don't know how to answer that," he admitted.

"Try."

It wasn't a suggestion. It was a challenge. A demand. *Be brave enough to tell me the truth.*

Eben thought about the contract in his pocketâ€”the letter he'd received from a security firm in Vancouver, offering him a six-week job starting in January. An exit strategy. A way out. A convenient excuse to leave before things got too complicated.

He'd declined it two days ago. Sent the email before he could talk himself out of it.

He thought about Sam's words: *You don't get to make that decision for him.*

He thought about what it meant to choose something, someone, without guarantees.

"You," Eben said, the word barely more than a whisper. "I want you."

Noel's breath hitched. He didn't move, didn't speak, just waited.

"I want you to stay," Eben continued, the words coming faster now, like a dam breaking, like something inside him had finally cracked open and all the things he'd been holding back were pouring out. "I want to wake up next to you. I want to argue about coffee and listen to you stress about logistics and watch you organize things that don't need organizing. I want to know what you look like in the summer. I want to learn your favorite foods and your worst habits and all the things that make you difficult to live with. I wantâ€”"

He stopped, overwhelmed by the enormity of it. By how much he wanted. By how terrifying it was to say it out loud.

"I want you," he said again, simpler this time. "I'm scared. I'm choosing you anyway."

The silence that followed felt different. Lighter, somehow. Like something had shifted.

Noel's eyes were too bright. "Say it again."

"I'm choosing you."

"Again."

"I'm choosing you, Noel."

Noel closed his eyes, and Eben saw the moment something in him brokeâ€”not shattered, but cracked open, letting light in. When he opened them again, there were tears on his lashes.

"I turned down the January contract," Eben said, because if he was doing this, he was doing it all the way. No more exit strategies. No more safety nets. "Two days ago. Before I knew if you'dâ€”if we couldâ€”"

"What?" Noel's eyes went wide. "The contract? The security job?"

"I closed the exit," Eben said. "Before I knew if you'd want me. Because I needed to choose first. Without guarantees."

The weight of that hung in the air between them. Eben watched Noel process itâ€”the timeline, the implications, the fact that Eben had made the choice before the conversation, before the apology, before any of this. He'd burned the lifeboat before knowing if anyone would rescue him.

"You already chose," Noel said, his voice barely audible.

"I already chose."

Noel made a sound that was half-laugh, half-sob. "You're an idiot."

"I know."

"You should have told me."

"I know."

"I thoughtâ€”" Noel's voice broke. "I thought you wanted to leave."

"I don't." Eben took a step closer, close enough to touch if he was brave enough. "I don't want to leave. I want to stay. With you. If you'llâ€”"

He didn't get to finish the sentence. Noel closed the distance between them, his hand coming up to cup Eben's face, and kissed him.

It wasn't desperate. It wasn't frantic. It was careful, tentative, like they were both learning how to do this again. Like they were both afraid of breaking something fragile.

When they pulled apart, Noel's forehead rested against Eben's, their breath mingling in the small space between them.

"We're not done talking about this," Noel said.

"I know."

"But Iâ€”" Noel swallowed hard. "I need to tell you something too."

Eben pulled back just enough to meet his eyes. "Okay."

"Not here," Noel said. "Somewhere private. Somewhere that's not a storage room that smells like mothballs and regret."

Despite everything, Eben felt a smile tug at his lips. "Your place?"

"My place."

They stood there for another moment, neither quite ready to let go, before Noel stepped back and reached for the door.

"Come on," he said. "Let's get out of here before someone finds us and puts us to work."

Eben followed him out of the storage room, into the noise and chaos of the hall, and thought: *This is what choosing feels like.*

It was terrifying.

It was also the first thing that had felt right in days.
# Chapter 4
## POV: Dual (Eben leads)

### POV: EBEN

Noel's apartment was exactly as Eben remembered itâ€”neat, organized, everything in its place. The books on the shelves were arranged by color. The throw pillows on the couch were perfectly fluffed. Even the shoes by the door were lined up with military precision.

But there was something different about it now, something he couldn't quite name. Maybe it was the way Noel moved through the space, less performative than usualâ€”no cheerful bustling, no *let me be the perfect host* energy. Or maybe it was just that Eben was seeing it differently, now that he'd admitted he wanted to stay.

They stood in the living room, the door closed behind them, and the silence felt different than it had in the storage room. Less fraught. More... waiting.

"Do you want coffee?" Noel asked, his voice carefully neutral. "Or tea, orâ€”"

"Noel." Eben caught his hand, gentle but firm. "You don't have to host me. We're past that."

Noel's shoulders sagged slightly, like he'd been holding himself up through sheer force of will and Eben had just given him permission to stop. "Okay."

They sat on the couchâ€”not touching, but close enough that Eben could feel the warmth of Noel's body next to his. Close enough that it would be easy to reach out, if he was brave enough.

"You said you needed to tell me something," Eben prompted gently.

Noel nodded, his gaze fixed on his hands. The ribbon was still tied around his wrist, frayed and faded now. Eben wanted to ask about itâ€”why he'd kept it, what it meant to himâ€”but he didn't. Not yet.

"On the ice," Noel started, his voice quiet. "Weeks ago. I tried to say something to you."

Eben's chest tightened. "I remember."

"I didn't finish it." Noel's fingers twisted together, restless. "Someone interruptedâ€”that group of kids who fell, remember?â€”and I let them. Let the interruption be an excuse. Because I was scared of what would happen if I said it out loud."

"What were you trying to say?"

Noel looked up, meeting Eben's eyes for the first time since they'd sat down. His expression was raw, unguarded in a way Eben had rarely seen. The performance was gone. The *everything's fine* mask had cracked.

"I need you," Noel said.

The words hung in the air between them, simple and devastating.

"Not to fix things," Noel continued, his voice gaining strength. "Not to run the festival. Not to be useful. I need you becauseâ€”"

He stopped. Swallowed hard. Tried again.

"Because I'm better when you stay."

Eben felt something crack open in his chest. "Noelâ€”"

"I know it's not fair," Noel said quickly, like he was afraid Eben would interrupt. "I know I can't ask you to stay just because I want you to. I know that's not how this works. But Iâ€”"

"Stop." Eben reached out, his hand cupping Noel's face, thumb brushing away a tear Noel probably didn't realize had fallen. "Stop apologizing for wanting me."

Noel's breath hitched. "I don't know how to do this without apologizing."

"I know." Eben's voice was soft, aching. "But you don't have to be useful to be wanted. You don't have to earn this."

"I don't know how to believe that."

"Then let me prove it to you."

The kiss was different this timeâ€”slower, deeper, less about desperation and more about *I'm here, I'm staying, I choose you*. Eben poured everything he couldn't say into it, every apology and promise and terrified hope, and felt Noel kiss him back like he was drowning and Eben was air.

When they pulled apart, both breathing hard, Noel's forehead rested against Eben's.

"I'm staying," Eben said, the words a vow. "I'm staying, Noel."

"Say it again."

"I'm staying."

"Again."

"I'm staying. I'm not going anywhere. I'm choosing you, and I'm staying."

Noel made a sound that was half-laugh, half-sob, and kissed him again.

---

### POV: NOEL

Noel had spent his whole life being useful.

He'd learned early that being needed was the closest thing to being wanted. His mother had been overwhelmed, his father distant, and the only time anyone seemed to notice him was when he was helping with somethingâ€”setting the table, organizing the garage, making sure everyone else's lives ran smoothly.

So he'd gotten good at it. Made himself indispensable. Became the person who anticipated needs before anyone voiced them, who solved problems before they became problems, who was always there with the right answer, the right smile, the right *of course I don't mind, I'm happy to help*.

And if that meant he never got to fall apart himself? If it meant swallowing his own needs because there was always someone who needed him more? That was just the price of being loved.

Except it wasn't love, was it? It was dependency. It was being kept around because he was useful, not because anyone actually wanted him.

And then Eben had looked at him and said: *You don't have to be useful to be wanted.*

Noel didn't know how to believe that. But God, he wanted to.

They were still on the couch, Eben's arm around his shoulders, Noel's head resting against his chest. He could hear Eben's heartbeat, steady and real, and thought about what it meant to be chosen without having to earn it.

"I turned down the contract," Eben said again, like he needed Noel to understand. "Before I knew if you'd want me back. I chose you first."

"Why?"

"Because I needed to." Eben's hand moved through Noel's hair, gentle and grounding. "Because I couldn't keep one foot out the door and expect you to believe I was serious. Because choosing you had to come first, not second."

Noel closed his eyes, overwhelmed. "What if I'd said no?"

"Then I would have dealt with it." Eben's voice was quiet but certain. "But I wouldn't have regretted choosing you. Even if you didn't choose me back."

"That's terrifying."

"Yeah." Eben's chest rose and fell beneath Noel's cheek. "It is."

They sat in silence for a while, just breathing together, letting the weight of the last few days settle into something manageable. Something they could carry together instead of struggling under alone.

"I'm sorry," Eben said eventually. "For what I said. For making you think I didn't want this."

"I'm sorry too," Noel said. "For not finishing the sentence. For letting you think I only needed you to be useful."

"We're both idiots."

"Wes said the same thing."

Eben laughed, the sound rumbling through his chest. "Of course he did. He's been giving me pointed looks for days. I'm pretty sure he was about to stage an intervention if we didn't figure it out ourselves."

Noel shifted, pulling back just enough to look at Eben's face. "What happens now?"

"Now?" Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's cheek, his thumb brushing over Noel's cheekbone with a tenderness that made Noel's chest ache. "Now we figure it out. Together."

"That's not a plan."

"No," Eben agreed. "It's not. But it's a start."

Noel thought about thatâ€”about starting over, about building something new from the wreckage of what they'd almost lost. About choosing each other, every day, without guarantees.

It was terrifying.

It was also the only thing he wanted.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay?"

"Okay." Noel leaned in, kissing Eben soft and slow. "Let's start."

### POV: EBEN

They talked for hours.

Not about logistics or plans or what the future looked like in concrete terms. Just... talked. About fear and want and all the ways they'd both been trying to protect themselves by pushing the other away. About Eben's belief that everyone leaves and Noel's belief that he had to earn love through service. About the ways they'd hurt each other and the ways they wanted to do better.

It wasn't easy. There were moments when Eben wanted to retreat, to pull back into the safety of silence, to build up walls again. Moments when Noel's voice went tight with old pain, when the conversation touched on wounds that hadn't fully healed.

But they kept going. Because thisâ€”this honesty, this vulnerability, this willingness to be seen in all their broken, messy, imperfect gloryâ€”was what repair looked like. Not perfect. Not painless. But real.

"I don't know how to do this," Noel admitted at one point, his voice small. "I don't know how to be in a relationship where I'm not constantly trying to prove I'm worth keeping."

"Then we'll figure it out together," Eben said. "I don't know how to do this either. I don't know how to stay without waiting for the other shoe to drop. But I want to learn."

"With me?"

"With you."

Noel's smile was tentative but real. "Okay."

The sun was setting by the time they ran out of words, the apartment bathed in the soft golden light of late afternoon. Orange and pink streaked across the sky outside the window, and the snow on the rooftops glowed like it had been touched with fire.

Eben looked at Noelâ€”really looked at him, taking in the exhaustion around his eyes, the way he was still holding himself a little too carefully, like he was afraid of breakingâ€”and felt something settle in his chest.

This was what he wanted. This person, this moment, this messy, complicated, terrifying thing they were building together.

"Stay for dinner," Noel said, and it wasn't a question.

"I'm staying," Eben said. "For dinner. For tonight. For as long as you'll have me."

Noel's eyes went bright. "That's a long time."

"Good."

They ordered takeoutâ€”Thai food from the place on Main Street that Noel loved and Eben had never tried. They ate on the couch, legs tangled together, and talked about nothing important: the festival, the weather, the ridiculous number of pipers who'd shown up for today's performance. Normal things. Easy things.

It felt like coming home.

Later, when the food was gone and the containers were in the trash and the apartment had gone dark except for the glow of the streetlights outside, Noel turned to Eben and said: "Stay tonight?"

Eben's heart kicked in his chest. "Are you sure?"

"I'm sure." Noel's hand found his, fingers lacing together. "I don't want to wake up alone tomorrow."

"Okay," Eben said. "I'll stay."

They moved to the bedroomâ€”not frantic, not desperate, just... together. Eben watched Noel move through the space, turning on the bedside lamp, pulling back the covers, and thought about how many times he'd imagined this. How many times he'd told himself it was impossible.

And now here he was. Choosing it. Choosing him.

"Come here," Noel said, and Eben went.

They lay down together, Noel's head on Eben's chest, Eben's arm around Noel's shoulders. The fit of it was perfectâ€”like they'd been designed to slot together like this, like this was where they were always meant to end up.

"Thank you," Noel said quietly. "For choosing me."

"Thank you for letting me," Eben replied.

They fell asleep like that, wrapped around each other, and for the first time in weeks, Eben didn't dream about leaving.
# Chapter 5
## POV: Eben

Eben woke to sunlight streaming through unfamiliar windows and Noel's weight warm against his side.

For a moment, he didn't moveâ€”just lay there, cataloging the feeling. The softness of Noel's sheets, which smelled faintly of lavender. The sound of Noel's breathing, slow and even, his chest rising and falling in a rhythm that Eben wanted to memorize. The way Noel's hand was curled against Eben's chest, like even in sleep he was holding on.

*I could get used to this,* Eben thought, and the realization didn't scare him the way it would have a week ago.

Noel stirred, his eyes blinking open slowly. When he saw Eben, his expression went softâ€”not guarded, not performative, just... happy. The kind of unguarded happiness that made something in Eben's chest ache with want.

"Morning," Noel murmured, his voice rough with sleep.

"Morning."

They lay there for a while, neither quite ready to move, watching the dust motes drift through the sunlight. Outside, Eben could hear the sounds of Tinsel Town waking upâ€”the distant bells of the church, the rumble of a snowplow on the main street, the muffled laughter of children already out playing in the snow.

Eventually, Noel shifted and propped himself up on one elbow. "I should probably check my phone. Make sure the festival didn't burn down overnight."

"Probably," Eben agreed, but he didn't let go.

Noel smiled, small and private, and leaned down to kiss him. It was soft, unhurried, the kind of kiss that said *we have time now*. When he pulled back, his eyes were serious.

"Last night," Noel started. "When you said you turned down the contractâ€”"

"I meant it," Eben said immediately. "I'm not going anywhere."

"I know. I justâ€”" Noel bit his lip, considering. "I need to understand. Why did you do it before talking to me? Before knowing if we could fix this?"

Eben sat up, pulling Noel with him so they were facing each other. This conversation deserved eye contact. Deserved honesty.

"Because I needed to choose you first," Eben said. "Not as a backup plan. Not as a 'maybe if this works out.' I needed to close the exit before I knew if you'd want me. Because otherwise, it wouldn't have been a real choice."

Noel's brow furrowed. "I don't understand."

"I've spent my whole life keeping one foot out the door," Eben explained, his voice steady even as his heart raced. "Always having an exit strategy. Always making sure I could leave before I got left. And I realizedâ€”if I did that with you, if I kept the contract as a safety net, then I'd never really be choosing you. I'd just be... hedging my bets. Keeping my options open."

"That's terrifying."

"Yeah." Eben's hand found Noel's, their fingers lacing together. "It is. But it was also the only way to prove to myself that I was serious. That this wasn't just... convenient, or temporary, or something I was doing because I didn't have better options. I needed to burn the boats before the battle."

"You're quoting Sun Tzu at me," Noel said, but he was smiling.

"I'm quoting common sense. If you want to win, you have to commit. And Iâ€”" Eben swallowed hard. "I want to win this, Noel. I want to make this work. With you."

Noel was quiet for a long moment, his thumb tracing circles on the back of Eben's hand. "What if I'd said no? What if I'd told you to leave?"

"Then I would have dealt with it," Eben said honestly. "I would have been heartbroken. But I wouldn't have regretted choosing you. Because the choice had to come first. Without guarantees."

"You're insane," Noel said, but his voice was soft, awed.

"Probably." Eben smiled, small and tentative. "But I'm your kind of insane, apparently."

Noel laughed, the sound bright and real, and kissed him again. This time it was deeper, more certain, like Noel was finally letting himself believe this was real.

When they pulled apart, Noel's eyes were bright. "Say it again."

"I chose you."

"Again."

"I chose you, Noel. I'm choosing you. I'll keep choosing you."

Noel's breath hitched. "Even though it's scary?"

"Especially because it's scary." Eben cupped Noel's face, his thumb brushing over his cheekbone. "Because the things worth having are always scary. And you're worth it. You're worth all of it."

"I don't know what I did to deserve you," Noel whispered.

"You don't have to do anything," Eben said firmly. "You don't have to earn this. You just have to let me stay."

Noel closed his eyes, and Eben saw the moment something in him shiftedâ€”not breaking, but opening. Letting the truth of it in.

"Okay," Noel said finally. "Okay. Stay."

"I'm staying."

They sat there for a while longer, just holding each other, letting the weight of the last few days settle into something they could carry together. Outside, Tinsel Town was in full Christmas Eve swingâ€”the sounds of traffic, of people starting their holiday, of a town preparing for its final festival event.

But in Noel's bedroom, wrapped in each other, it felt like they had all the time in the world.

---

### Later

They made breakfast togetherâ€”or rather, Noel made breakfast while Eben sat at the kitchen counter and watched, occasionally offering commentary that Noel ignored with fond exasperation.

"You're terrible at this," Noel said, flipping a pancake with more force than strictly necessary.

"I'm providing moral support," Eben countered. "That's important."

"You're providing running commentary on my pancake technique. That's annoying."

"Your pancake technique is objectively fascinating. The way you flip them with such... aggression."

"You love it."

Noel paused, spatula in hand, and turned to look at Eben. The word hung in the air between themâ€”*love*â€”not quite said but hovering close enough to touch.

"Yeah," Noel said softly, something vulnerable flickering in his eyes. "I do."

Eben's chest went tight. They weren't there yetâ€”weren't ready to say the word out loud, not when everything was still so new and fragile and terrifying. But the acknowledgment of it, the permission to feel it, was enough.

"Good," Eben said, his voice rough. "Because I'm not going anywhere."

They ate breakfast at the small kitchen table, knees bumping underneath, and talked about the day ahead. The final festival event. The closing ceremony. The fact that after tonight, the twelve days would be over and they'd have to figure out what came next.

"What do you want to do?" Noel asked. "After the festival, I mean. Do you have plans? Orâ€”"

"I want to stay here," Eben said. "In Tinsel Town. With you. If that's okay."

Noel's smile was bright enough to rival the sun. "That's more than okay."

"Good." Eben reached across the table, taking Noel's hand. "Because I meant what I said. I'm choosing you. Every day. For as long as you'll have me."

"That's a long time," Noel said, echoing his words from the night before.

"I'm counting on it."

They finished breakfast in comfortable silence, the kind that felt less like running out of things to say and more like not needing to fill every moment with words. When they were done, Noel stood and started clearing the dishes, but Eben caught his wrist.

"Leave them," Eben said. "Come here."

Noel raised an eyebrow. "The dishesâ€”"

"Can wait." Eben tugged him closer, until Noel was standing between his knees. "I want to talk to you about something."

Noel's expression shifted, a flicker of worry crossing his face. "Okay?"

"Nothing bad," Eben said quickly. "I justâ€”I want to make sure we're on the same page. About what this is. About what we're doing."

"What do you mean?"

Eben took a breath, trying to organize his thoughts. "I don't want this to be temporary. I don't want to wake up in six months and realize we never actually talked about what we want, and we're just... drifting. I want to be intentional about this. About us."

Noel's expression softened. "What do you want, Eben?"

"You," Eben said simply. "I want you. I want to build something with you. I want to figure out what it looks like when I stay, and you let me, and we stop being scared of what that means."

"I want that too," Noel said, his voice barely above a whisper.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." Noel's hand came up to cup Eben's face, his touch gentle. "I want you to stay. I want to stop waiting for you to leave. I want to believe that this is real."

"It is real," Eben said. "I'm making it real. We're making it real."

Noel kissed him, slow and deep, and Eben felt the last of his fear dissolve into something warmer. Something that felt like hope.

When they pulled apart, Noel rested his forehead against Eben's. "We should probably get ready. The festivalâ€”"

"Can wait," Eben said again. "Just... give me a few more minutes. Please."

Noel smiled. "Okay."

They stood there in the kitchen, wrapped around each other, and let the world wait.

---

### Afternoon

By the time they made it to Merryweather Hall, the setup was already in full swing. Volunteers rushed around with decorations and sound equipment, and the energy was electricâ€”the kind of barely-controlled chaos that came with the final event of a twelve-day festival.

Wes spotted them first. His eyes went wide, then narrowed, and then he was crossing the hall with purpose, a mixing bowl still tucked under one arm.

"You two," he said, pointing at them with a flour-covered finger. "You fixed it."

It wasn't a question.

"We're working on it," Noel said, but he was smiling, and Eben saw Wes's expression soften into something that looked almost like relief.

"Good," Wes said. "Because watching you two mope around was exhausting. Don't do it again."

"We'll try," Eben said dryly.

Wes looked between them, then nodded once, satisfied. "Sam's going to be insufferable when he finds out he was right."

"He was right?" Noel asked.

"He said you'd figure it out by Christmas Eve. I said it would take at least another week." Wes sighed dramatically, the effect somewhat ruined by the smear of chocolate on his cheek. "I owe him twenty bucks now. And a pie."

Despite everything, Eben laughed. "You bet on us?"

"The whole town bet on you," Wes said matter-of-factly. "You're not exactly subtle. The pining was visible from space."

Noel groaned, burying his face in his hands. "Oh my God."

"Don't worry about it," Wes said, clapping him on the shoulder. "We're all rooting for you. Now get to work. This event isn't going to run itself, and I have six dozen cookies that need to be plated."

He walked away, leaving Eben and Noel standing in the middle of the hall, both slightly stunned.

"The whole town," Noel said faintly.

"Apparently," Eben agreed.

They looked at each other, and then they were both laughing, the sound bright and free and full of relief.

"Come on," Noel said, taking Eben's hand. "Let's go make sure the pipers don't set anything on fire."

"Together?"

"Together."

And for the first time in a long time, Eben believed it.
# Chapter 6
## POV: Noel

The festival ended at sunset.

Noel stood at the edge of Merryweather Hall, watching the final performance wind downâ€”eleven pipers in full regalia, their kilts swaying as they played, their music bright and clear in the cold evening air. The crowd was entranced, faces lit with wonder and the warm glow of a thousand string lights, and Noel felt a swell of pride that had nothing to do with logistics or planning.

They'd done it. Twelve days of chaos, of impossible deadlines and last-minute disasters and sponsors who kept changing their minds. Twelve days of barely holding it together. And they'd actually pulled it off.

The final note of the pipers' song hung in the air for a moment, pure and perfect, before the crowd erupted into applause. Noel clapped along, feeling something ease in his chest for the first time in weeks. It was over. The festival was over.

And somehow, miraculously, he hadn't lost everything in the process.

Eben appeared at his elbow, close enough that their shoulders brushed. "You okay?"

"Yeah." Noel turned to look at him, taking in the soft expression on Eben's faceâ€”the way his eyes crinkled at the corners, the way he was looking at Noel like he was something precious. "I'm good. Just... processing."

"It's a lot."

"It is." Noel glanced back at the performance, then back at Eben. "Can we get out of here? Just for a bit? I needâ€”" He didn't know how to finish the sentence. He just knew he needed to be somewhere quiet, somewhere private, somewhere he could breathe without an audience.

Eben's hand found his, their fingers lacing together. The touch was warm, grounding to Noel. "Where do you want to go?"

"Anywhere that's not here."

They slipped out the side door, into the quiet of the evening. The air was crisp and cold, biting at Noel's cheeks and nose, but it felt good after the warmth and press of bodies inside. Snow crunched under their feet as they walked, the sound oddly peaceful in the stillness.

They ended up at the gazebo in Evergreen Square, the same one where they'd stood weeks ago during the first festival eventâ€”the tree lighting ceremony that felt like a lifetime ago now. Noel remembered standing here, barely tolerating Eben's presence, convinced he was going to ruin everything.

How things had changed.

Noel sat on the bench, and Eben sat beside him, their thighs pressed together. For a while, neither of them spokeâ€”just sat in the comfortable silence, watching the town move around them. Families walked by with children in tow, couples strolled hand in hand, everyone wrapped up against the cold and glowing with holiday cheer.

"Weeks ago," Noel said eventually, breaking the quiet. "On the ice. I tried to tell you something."

Eben turned to look at him, his expression careful. "I remember."

"I didn't finish it." Noel's fingers twisted together in his lap, restless. "Someone interruptedâ€”those kids who fellâ€”and I let them. Let it be an excuse to stop. Because I was scared."

"What were you trying to say?"

Noel took a breath, forcing himself to meet Eben's eyes. This was it. The moment he'd been building toward for weeks. The sentence he'd started and never finished, the words that had been stuck in his throat for so long they'd started to feel like stones.

"I need you," Noel said.

The words felt too big, too vulnerable, but Noel pushed through. He'd come this far. He wasn't going to stop now.

"Not to fix things," he continued, his voice stronger now. "Not to run the festival. Not to be useful. I need you becauseâ€”"

He stopped. Swallowed hard against the tightness in his throat. Tried again.

"Because I'm better when you stay."

Eben's expression went soft, something complicated flickering across his face. "Noelâ€”"

"I know I can't ask you to stay just because I want you to," Noel continued, the words tumbling out now, all the things he'd been holding back for weeks finally breaking free. "I know that's not fair. I know that's not how relationships work. But Iâ€”"

"Stop." Eben's hand came up to cup Noel's face, his touch gentle. "Stop apologizing for wanting me."

"I don't know how to do this without apologizing."

"I know." Eben's thumb brushed over Noel's cheekbone, and Noel realized with a start that he was cryingâ€”tears tracking down his cheeks, warm against the cold air. "But you don't have to earn this. You don't have to be useful to be wanted. You just have to let me stay."

Noel closed his eyes, overwhelmed. All his life, he'd believed the opposite. That his worth was measured in service, in usefulness, in how much he could give. The idea that someone might want him just for himself, not for what he could do...

"What if I'm not enough?" he whispered.

"You are." Eben's voice was firm, certain. "You're more than enough. You always have been."

"I don't know how to believe that."

"Then let me prove it to you." Eben leaned in, pressing his forehead against Noel's. "Every day. For as long as it takes."

Noel's breath hitched. "You mean that?"

"I mean it." Eben pulled back just enough to meet his eyes. "I'm staying, Noel. I'm choosing you. Every day."

"Even when I'm difficult?"

"Especially when you're difficult."

Despite everything, Noel laughedâ€”a wet, shaky sound that was half-sob. "You're insane."

"Probably." Eben smiled, soft and private. "But I'm your kind of insane."

Noel kissed him, pouring everything he couldn't say into itâ€”all the fear and hope and desperate, aching want. Eben kissed him back like he understood, like he felt it too, and for the first time in weeks, Noel let himself believe that maybe, just maybe, this could work.

When they pulled apart, both breathing hard, Noel rested his forehead against Eben's. "I need you," he said again, quieter this time. "I need you to stay."

"I'm staying," Eben said. "I promise."

"Okay."

"That okay counts," Eben said, and Noel heard the echo of Wes and Sam in the words, the callback to conversations he'd overheard, to the way the whole town had been watching them dance around each other for weeks.

Noel laughed, real and bright. "It counts."

They sat there for a while longer, wrapped around each other, letting the world move on without them. The sky had gone from orange to purple to deep blue, stars beginning to peek through the clouds. The festival would end. The town would go back to normal. But thisâ€”this thing they were building togetherâ€”would stay.

"We should probably get back," Noel said eventually, reluctant. "The closing ceremonyâ€”"

"Can wait," Eben said, echoing his words from earlier. "Just... give me a few more minutes."

Noel smiled. "Okay."

They stayed in the gazebo, holding each other, and let the world wait.

---

### Later

The closing ceremony was beautiful.

Noel stood at the edge of the crowd, watching the final speechâ€”Mayor Kringle in his element, all beaming smiles and grand gesturesâ€”and then the lighting of the massive Christmas tree in Evergreen Square. The whole town had gathered, it seemed, bundled in coats and scarves, faces upturned to watch as the tree blazed to life, thousands of lights sparkling against the dark sky like earth-bound stars.

Eben was beside him, their hands linked, and Noel felt a swell of something he couldn't quite name.

Gratitude, maybe. Or relief. Or just... happiness. The kind of simple, uncomplicated happiness he'd almost forgotten how to feel.

"You did good," Eben murmured, his voice low enough that only Noel could hear.

"We did good," Noel corrected.

Eben smiled. "Yeah. We did."

The crowd erupted into applause as the tree lit up fully, the light cascading down from the star at the top to the lowest branches, bathing everyone in a warm golden glow. Noel watched it for a moment, then turned to look at Ebenâ€”really look at him, taking in the soft expression on his face, the way he was watching the tree with something like wonder.

"I love you," Noel said, the words slipping out before he could stop them.

Eben's head whipped around, his eyes wide. "What?"

Noel's heart was pounding, adrenaline spiking through his veins, but he didn't take it back. He'd spent too long not saying the things that mattered. "I love you. I'm in love with you. And I know we're notâ€”I know it's too soon, or too fast, or whatever, but Iâ€”"

Eben kissed him, cutting off the rambling apology. It was soft and sweet and full of promise, and when he pulled back, his eyes were bright with something that looked a lot like tears.

"I love you too," Eben said, his voice rough with emotion. "I'm in love with you, Noel."

Noel's breath caught. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." Eben's hand came up to cup his face, thumb brushing over his cheekbone. "I'm staying. I'm choosing you. And I love you."

Noel kissed him again, and this time it was deeper, more certain, like they were both finally letting themselves believe this was real. Around them, the crowd cheeredâ€”for the tree, for the festival, for the magic of Christmas Eve in a small town. But Noel barely heard it. All he could focus on was Eben, and the way Eben was looking at him like he was everything.

"Come home with me," Noel said when they finally pulled apart.

Eben smiled. "I thought you'd never ask."

They slipped away from the crowd, hand in hand, and walked back to Noel's apartment through the quiet streets. The festival was over. The twelve days were done. But thisâ€”this thing they were buildingâ€”was just beginning.

And for the first time in a long time, Noel wasn't scared of what came next.

He was ready for it.
# Chapter 7
## POV: Both (Alternating)

### POV: NOEL

The door to Noel's apartment closed behind them with a soft click, and suddenly the world narrowed to just the two of them.

The noise of the festival, the crowd, the cold December airâ€”all of it faded away, replaced by the warm quiet of Noel's apartment and the sound of their breathing, slightly unsteady, slightly too fast. The only light came from the streetlamps outside, casting soft shadows across the floor.

Noel's heart was poundingâ€”not with anxiety, but with anticipation. With want. With the knowledge that this time, it would be different. This time, they were choosing each other with full knowledge of what that meant.

Eben was watching him, his expression soft and open in a way Noel had rarely seen. All the walls were down. All the defenses stripped away. Just Eben, looking at Noel like he was something precious.

"Are you sure about this?" Eben asked, his voice quiet in the stillness.

"I'm sure." Noel stepped closer, eliminating the distance between them, his hands coming up to rest on Eben's chest. He could feel Eben's heart beating beneath his palmsâ€”fast, matching his own. "I want this. I want you."

"I want you too," Eben said, his voice rough. "God, Noel, Iâ€”"

Noel kissed him, cutting off whatever he'd been about to say. The kiss was slow, deliberate, full of intention. Not frantic or desperate like it might have been before, but certain. *I'm choosing this. I'm choosing you.*

Eben's hands came up to cup Noel's face, his touch gentle and reverent, and Noel felt something in his chest crack open. This was what he'd been missing. This tenderness. This care. The feeling of being held like he mattered, not for what he could do, but for who he was.

"Tell me you're staying," Noel whispered against Eben's lips.

"I'm staying," Eben said immediately, no hesitation. "I'm not going anywhere."

"Say it again."

"I'm staying, Noel. I'm here. I'm yours."

Noel's breath hitched, something hot and overwhelming building behind his eyes. He kissed Eben again, deeper this time, pouring all the words he couldn't say into the press of his lips, the slide of his tongue. Eben responded in kind, his hands sliding down to Noel's waist, pulling him closer until there was no space left between them.

They moved toward the bedroom without breaking apart, a tangle of limbs and breathless laughter when Noel nearly tripped over his own shoes by the door. Eben caught him, steadied him, pressed a smile against his temple.

"Careful," Eben murmured, and there was so much tenderness in that single word that Noel felt his throat go tight.

When they finally made it to the bed, Eben pulled back just enough to look at Noel's face. The streetlight from outside painted half his features in gold, the other half in shadow, and his eyes were dark with want.

"I love you," Eben said, the words simple and devastating.

"I love you too," Noel replied, and it felt like the easiest thing in the world to say.

---

### POV: EBEN

Eben had imagined this moment more times than he could count.

Late at night, when he couldn't sleep. In the stolen moments between one festival crisis and the next. In the days since their fight, when he'd lain awake staring at unfamiliar ceilings and wondering if he'd ruined everything.

But the reality was so much better than anything his imagination had conjured. Because this wasn't just physicalâ€”it was emotional, vulnerable, real in a way that made his chest ache with something that felt terrifyingly close to hope.

He kissed Noel slowly, taking his time, memorizing the taste of himâ€”coffee and something sweet, maybe hot chocolate from the festival. Memorizing the sound of his breathing, slightly ragged now. The way he arched into Eben's touch like he was starving for it.

And maybe he was. Maybe they both were.

"Tell me what you want," Eben murmured against Noel's skin, pressing kisses along his jaw, his throat, the sensitive spot just below his ear that made Noel shiver.

"You," Noel said, his voice breathless. "Just you."

"You have me." Eben's hands moved over Noel's body, learning him, relearning himâ€”the planes and angles, the soft places and the firm ones, the spots that made him gasp. "You've always had me."

Noel's hands were equally busy, pulling at Eben's shirt with fingers that trembled slightlyâ€”not from cold, but from something else. Something that felt like relief and want and a desperation to be close. "I needâ€”"

"I know," Eben said, helping him with the buttons. "I've got you."

They undressed each other slowly, carefully, like they were unwrapping something precious. Each article of clothing fell away, and with it, another layer of defense. By the time they were skin to skin, Eben felt more exposed than he ever had in his lifeâ€”and more safe.

He paused, just looking at Noel spread out beneath himâ€”flushed and wanting and beautiful in the soft light. His hair was mussed, his lips swollen from kissing, and his eyes...

His eyes were looking at Eben like he was home.

"You're staring," Noel said, but there was no heat in it. Just fondness. Just love.

"Can't help it," Eben said honestly. "You'reâ€”"

"Don't," Noel interrupted, his cheeks going pink. "Don't get sappy on me."

"Too late." Eben leaned down, pressing a kiss to Noel's collarbone, then another lower, then another. "I'm already gone."

Noel laughed, the sound bright and free and full of joy, and pulled Eben down into another kiss.

### POV: NOEL

They took their time.

There was no rush, no frantic urgency like there might have been before. Just slow, deliberate touches, whispered words, the kind of intimacy that came from knowing they had all the time in the world.

Eben's hands were everywhereâ€”gentle, careful, reverent. Like Noel was something to be cherished. And maybe he was. Maybe that was what this felt like: being cherished. Being wanted not for what he could do, but for who he was.

It was terrifying. It was wonderful. It was everything Noel had never let himself hope for.

"I'm sorry," Eben whispered at one point, his lips against Noel's shoulder, his fingers tracing patterns on Noel's hip. "For what I said. For making you think I didn't want this."

"I know," Noel said, his fingers threading through Eben's hair, holding him close. "I've got you."

"Say my name," Eben said, his voice rough.

"Eben," Noel breathed, and felt Eben shudder against himâ€”a full-body tremor that had nothing to do with cold and everything to do with this, with them, with the way they fit together like puzzle pieces that had finally found their match.

They moved together, finding a rhythm that felt natural, inevitable. Noel had never felt so present, so connected, so *seen*. Every touch, every kiss, every whispered word was a promise: *I'm here. I'm staying. I choose you.*

"Tell me you're staying," Noel said, needing to hear it again.

"I'm staying."

"Tell me you want this."

"I want this. I want you. Only you."

"Tell meâ€”" Noel's voice broke, overwhelmed by sensation and emotion. "Tell me I'm enough."

Eben stilled, pulling back just enough to look into Noel's eyes. His expression was fierce, tender, so full of love that Noel felt tears prick at his eyes.

"You're enough," Eben said, each word deliberate. "You're more than enough. You're everything."

Noel kissed him, swallowing the words, tasting them on his tongue. And then they were moving again, building toward something that felt like completion, like coming home.

"I love you," Noel said, because he couldn't say it enough. "I love you, Eben."

"I love you too," Eben replied, his voice breaking on the words. "God, Noel, I love you so much."

### POV: EBEN

Eben had never been good with words.

He was a fixer, a planner, a man who showed his feelings through action rather than speech. But here, now, with Noel beneath him, he found himself saying things he'd never said to anyone. Couldn't stop saying them. Like the walls he'd built around his heart had crumbled completely, leaving nothing but raw, vulnerable truth.

"You're everything," he whispered against Noel's skin, pressing the words into his shoulder, his chest, the hollow of his throat. "You're everything I didn't know I wanted."

Noel's hands tightened on his shoulders, pulling him closer. "Don't stop," he said, and Eben wasn't sure if he meant the words or the touch, but it didn't matter. He wasn't stopping either way.

"I was so scared," Eben confessed, the words spilling out between kisses. "So scared of wanting you. Of needing you. Ofâ€” of becoming someone who couldn't leave."

"Then stay," Noel said simply. "Stay and become that person. With me."

"I am." Eben's voice cracked. "I'm staying. I'm choosing this. I'm choosing you."

They built toward completion slowly, the tension coiling tighter and tighter, pleasure building in waves that crested and receded and crested again. When it finally broke, it was like a dam releasingâ€”Noel's voice, breathless and wrecked, saying Eben's name like a prayer. Eben's own release following moments later, a surrender as much as a triumph.

For a long moment afterward, neither of them moved. Just lay there, tangled together, breathing hard, hearts pounding in sync.

"You okay?" Eben asked softly.

"More than okay," Noel said, his voice drowsy and content. "That wasâ€”"

"Yeah," Eben agreed, because there weren't really words for what that had been.

He pressed a kiss to Noel's temple, then his cheek, then his lips. Gentle now. Tender. The urgency was gone, replaced by something softer. Something that felt like peace.

### POV: NOEL

They shifted, getting comfortable, and Eben pulled Noel close, wrapping his arms around him like he never wanted to let go. Noel's head rested on Eben's chest, rising and falling with each breath, and he could hear Eben's heartbeat slowly returning to normal.

This was the part he'd always been afraid ofâ€”the after. The moment when the passion faded and you were left with just yourselves, exposed and vulnerable. The moment when the other person might decide you weren't worth the trouble after all.

But Eben wasn't pulling away. Wasn't checking his phone or making excuses to leave. He was just... holding Noel. Like this was exactly where he wanted to be.

"I'm staying," Eben said again, unprompted, like he knew Noel needed to hear it. Because he needed to say it.

"I know," Noel murmured, already half-asleep. "I believe you."

He felt Eben's arms tighten around him, felt the press of lips against his hair, and something in his chest that had been wound tight for years finally started to loosen.

This was what being loved felt like. Not earning love through service. Not performing worthiness. Just... being held. Being wanted. Being enough.

### POV: EBEN

Noel woke sometime later to find Eben still awake, his fingers tracing idle patterns on Noel's shoulder.

"Can't sleep?" Noel asked, his voice rough.

"Just thinking," Eben said.

"About what?"

"About how lucky I am." Eben's hand stilled, coming to rest over Noel's heart. "About how close I came to losing this."

Noel shifted, propping himself up so he could see Eben's face in the dim light. "You didn't lose it."

"I could have," Eben said quietly. "If you hadn't been brave enough to give me another chanceâ€”"

"Stop," Noel interrupted gently. "We both made mistakes. We both had to be brave. And we're here now. That's what matters."

Eben's eyes were too bright, and Noel realized with a start that he was seeing Eben cry for the first time. Not sobsâ€”just a single tear tracking down his cheek, catching the light from outside.

"I don't deserve you," Eben whispered.

"That's not how this works," Noel said firmly. "You don't have to deserve me. You just have to choose me. And you did."

"I did," Eben agreed. "I do. Every day."

Noel kissed him, soft and sweet, and felt Eben relax beneath him. "We're going to be okay," Noel said. "We're going to figure this out together."

"Together," Eben echoed, like he was testing the word on his tongue. "I like the sound of that."

"Good." Noel settled back down, his head on Eben's chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. "Because you're stuck with me now."

"Best thing that ever happened to me," Eben murmured, his fingers resuming their gentle patterns on Noel's skin.

Noel smiled, his eyes drifting closed. "Go to sleep, Eben."

"In a minute," Eben said. "I just want toâ€”"

But whatever he wanted to say was lost as sleep finally claimed him. Noel felt the moment Eben's breathing evened out, felt the way his body relaxed completely, and thought: *This is what home feels like.*

He fell asleep with that thought, warm and safe and loved, and didn't dream of anything but tomorrow.
# Chapter 8
## POV: Dual (Noel leads)

### POV: NOEL

Noel woke on Christmas morning to snow falling outside the window and Eben's arm around him.

For a moment, he just lay there, watching the flakes drift past the glass like they had all the time in the world. The sky was that particular shade of gray-white that came with heavy snowfall, and the light filtering into the bedroom was soft and diffuse, painting everything in gentle shadows.

He could feel the steady rise and fall of Eben's breathing against his back, the warmth of Eben's body curled around his. The weight of Eben's arm across his waist, grounding him. Keeping him close.

It was Christmas. The festival was over. And Eben was still here.

Noel felt something warm and bright unfurl in his chest, something that felt dangerously close to hope. To joy. To the kind of uncomplicated happiness he'd almost forgotten how to feel.

"You're awake," Eben murmured, his voice rough with sleep.

"So are you," Noel said, smiling even though Eben couldn't see it.

"Hard to sleep when you're thinking so loud." Eben's arm tightened around him, pulling him closer. "What's going on in that head of yours?"

"Just... processing." Noel turned in Eben's arms so they were face to face, drinking in the sight of himâ€”sleep-rumpled and soft, his hair a disaster, his eyes still heavy-lidded and warm. "The festival's over."

"It is."

"It's Christmas Day." Noel bit his lip, something complicated moving through his chest. "And thenâ€”what? What happens after?"

Eben was quiet for a moment, his hand coming up to cup Noel's face. His thumb brushed over Noel's cheekbone, gentle and grounding.

"I stay," Eben said simply.

The words landed like a promise. Like a vow. Noel's breath caught. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." Eben's expression was soft, open, more vulnerable than Noel had ever seen it in the daylight. "I stay. I figure out what it looks like to build a life here. With you. If you want that."

"I want that," Noel said immediately. "I want that so much."

"Good." Eben leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Noel's forehead. "Because I'm not going anywhere."

They lay there for a while, just holding each other, watching the snow fall outside. The world was quietâ€”that particular hush that came with Christmas morning, like everyone was tucked inside with their families, savoring the stillness before the day began in earnest.

Noel felt something settle in his chestâ€”not the anxious, desperate need to hold on tight, but something calmer. More certain. This was real. This was happening. And for the first time in a long time, Noel wasn't scared of what came next.

He was ready for it.

### POV: EBEN

"What do you want to do today?" Eben asked eventually, his fingers tracing idle patterns on Noel's shoulder.

"Honestly?" Noel laughed, the sound soft and a little embarrassed. "Nothing. I want to stay in bed with you and pretend the outside world doesn't exist."

"That sounds perfect," Eben said, and meant it.

They did exactly that. Stayed in bed, tangled together under the covers, talking about nothing importantâ€”favorite movies, childhood Christmases, embarrassing stories they'd never told anyone else. Normal things. Easy things.

It felt like coming home.

Eventually, hunger drove them out of bed and into the kitchen, where they made breakfast together. Or rather, Noel made breakfastâ€”pancakes and eggs and baconâ€”while Eben sat at the counter and provided moral support, which mostly consisted of stealing pieces of bacon when Noel wasn't looking and offering running commentary on his cooking technique.

"You're impossible," Noel said, swatting his hand away from the bacon plate.

"You love it," Eben countered.

"I love you," Noel corrected, and Eben's heart did something complicated in his chestâ€”a flutter of joy and disbelief that he got to have this. That he was allowed to want it.

"I love you too," Eben said, pulling Noel into a kiss that tasted like maple syrup and promise.

They ate breakfast at the small kitchen table, knees bumping underneath, and Eben thought about how many mornings he wanted like this. How many mornings he could have, if he was brave enough to keep choosing it.

"What are you thinking about?" Noel asked, catching him staring.

"Just... this," Eben said honestly. "How much I want it. How scared I was that I'd never get it."

Noel's smile was soft, private. "You have it. You have me."

"I know." Eben reached across the table, taking Noel's hand. "I'm still getting used to believing it."

"We have time," Noel said. "All the time in the world."

### POV: NOEL

Later, they bundled up and went for a walk through Tinsel Town.

The town was quiet on Christmas morning, most people still inside with their families, but there was something magical about itâ€”the fresh snow blanketing everything in white, the decorated storefronts, the way the whole place looked like something out of a holiday card. Wreaths on every door. Lights still twinkling on every porch. The massive Christmas tree in Evergreen Square still glowing, even in the daylight.

They walked hand in hand, not talking much, just being together. Noel felt lighter than he had in weeksâ€”like some weight he'd been carrying had finally been lifted from his shoulders.

"Thank you," Eben said suddenly.

Noel looked at him, surprised. "For what?"

"For giving me another chance." Eben's expression was serious, his eyes bright with something that looked like gratitude. "For being brave enough to finish the sentence. For letting me stay."

"You don't have to thank me for that," Noel said softly. "I wanted you to stay. I've always wanted you to stay."

"I know." Eben stopped walking, turning to face Noel fully. "But I'm thanking you anyway. Because you could have told me to leave. You could have decided I wasn't worth the risk. And you didn't."

Noel's throat went tight. "You're worth it," he said. "You're worth the risk. You're worth everything."

Eben kissed him, right there in the middle of Main Street where anyone could see, and Noel kissed him back like it was the most natural thing in the world. Because it was.

When they pulled apart, both smiling, Noel saw Mrs. Henderson watching from across the street, a knowing look on her face and a mug of something steaming in her hands. He waved, and she waved back, her expression fond.

"The whole town knows," Noel said, half-amused, half-mortified.

"Let them know," Eben said, taking his hand again. "I'm not hiding this. I'm not hiding you."

Noel's heart swelled. "Okay."

They walked back to Noel's apartment as the sun started to set, painting the sky in shades of pink and gold and deep purple. Inside, they made hot chocolate and curled up on the couch, wrapped in blankets, watching the snow fall outside in the gathering dusk.

"What happens now?" Noel asked, quieter this time.

"Now?" Eben considered the question, his arm tightening around Noel's shoulders. "I stay. I figure out what it looks like to live here. To build a life with you. To stop running."

"That's not a very detailed plan," Noel said, but he was smiling.

"No," Eben agreed. "But it's a start."

Noel thought about thatâ€”about starting over, about building something new, about choosing each other every day without guarantees. It was terrifying. It was also the only thing he wanted.

"Okay," he said.

Eben pulled back slightly, looking at him with something like wonder. "Okay?"

"Okay." Noel leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Eben's lips. "Let's start."

"That okay counts," Eben said, a callback to their earlier conversation, to Wes and Sam, to all the moments where *okay* had meant something more.

Noel laughed, bright and real. "It counts."

They settled back into the couch, wrapped around each other, and watched the snow fall. Outside, Tinsel Town was settling into Christmas nightâ€”lights in windows, families gathered around tables, the whole town wrapped in the quiet magic of the holiday.

But inside Noel's apartment, warm and safe and together, it felt like they had all the time in the world.

### POV: EBEN

Night fell slowly, the apartment growing dark except for the glow of the streetlights outside and the Christmas tree in the corner that Noel had insisted on decorating, even though he'd been alone when he did it. Now, with Eben beside him, the lights seemed to glow brighter.

Eben held Noel close, feeling the steady rhythm of his breathing, and thought about how close he'd come to losing this. How close he'd come to running, to choosing fear over love, to letting his past dictate his future.

But he hadn't. He'd chosen to stay. And Noel had chosen to let him.

"I'm scared," Eben admitted quietly into the stillness.

Noel shifted, looking up at him. "Of what?"

"Of messing this up," Eben said honestly. "Of falling back into old patterns. Ofâ€”"

"Hey." Noel's hand came up to cup his face, gentle and grounding. "We're going to mess up. Both of us. That's part of being human. But we'll figure it out together. Okay?"

"Okay," Eben said, and felt some of the tension ease from his shoulders.

"I'm scared too," Noel admitted. "Of messing this up. Ofâ€”"

"I know." Eben pulled him closer. "Me too. But we'll figure it out."

Noel smiled against his chest. "Together?"

"Together."

They kissed, soft and slow, and Eben felt something settle in his chest. This was what he wanted. This person, this moment, this life they were building together.

"Come on," Noel said eventually, pulling back. "Let's go to bed."

They moved to the bedroom, getting ready for sleep with the easy familiarity of people who belonged together. When they finally climbed into bed, Noel immediately curled into Eben's side, his head on Eben's chest.

"Merry Christmas," Noel murmured, already half-asleep.

"Merry Christmas," Eben replied, pressing a kiss to the top of Noel's head.

He lay there for a while, listening to Noel's breathing even out, feeling the weight of him warm and solid against his side. Outside, snow continued to fall, blanketing Tinsel Town in white.

Tomorrow would bring new challenges. Tomorrow they'd have to figure out what came nextâ€”where Eben would live, what he'd do for work, how they'd navigate the messy reality of building a life together. There would be hard conversations and compromises and moments of doubt.

But for now, Eben was content to just be here. To hold Noel. To let himself believe that this was real.

### POV: NOEL

Noel fell asleep on Christmas night with Eben's arm around him and thought: *This is what staying feels like.*

It felt like warmth. Like safety. Like coming home after a long journey and finding the door unlocked, the lights on, someone waiting for you inside.

It felt like Eben's heartbeat under his ear, steady and sure. Like the weight of Eben's arm around his shoulders, grounding him. Like the soft press of Eben's lips against his temple, a wordless promise.

It felt like hope.

Noel had spent so long believing that love was something you earned, something you had to work for, something that could be taken away if you weren't useful enough, good enough, perfect enough.

But thisâ€”this thing with Ebenâ€”wasn't like that. It was messy and complicated and sometimes scary, but it was also real. It was choosing each other, every day, without guarantees. It was being brave enough to be vulnerable. It was staying, even when it was hard.

It was love.

And for the first time in a long time, Noel let himself believe he deserved it.

Outside, snow fell softly over Tinsel Town, covering the town in a blanket of white. The Christmas tree in Evergreen Square had finally been turned off for the night, and the streets were empty and peaceful, the whole town sleeping.

Inside, wrapped in Eben's arms, Noel felt something he hadn't felt in years:

Peace.

Tomorrow would bring new challenges. Tomorrow they'd have to figure out what it looked like to build a life together, to navigate the messy reality of a relationship, to keep choosing each other when things got hard.

But tonight, on Christmas night, Noel let himself just be. Just feel. Just stay.

And as he drifted off to sleep, warm and safe and loved, his last thought was simple:

*This is what staying feels like.*
