## Heat Content

**Level:** Tease / Charged Tension (no physical contact beyond accidental)

**Key moments:**
- Lingering eye contact
- Accidental touches
- Awareness of each other's presence
- Eben's glove removal (deliberate, controlled)
- Arms brush; neither moves away

---

## Key Dialogue

| Character | Line | Context |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Eben | "Do you need help?" | First question |
| Noel | "I'm handling it." | Denial |
| Eben | "That's one word for it." | Assessment |
| Eben | "Temporary." | The lie begins |

---

## Motifs to Establish

- **Ribbon/bows:** Noel's domain, festival work
- **Gloves:** Eben's armor/control (removal = vulnerability)
- **"Temporary":** The central lie

---

## Cozy Textures

- **Smell:** Cold pine, coffee, cinnamon
- **Tactile:** Eben's gloves, cold air, Noel's chapped hands
- **Light:** Morning dark → evening twinkle lights
- **Food:** Wes's pastries, coffee throughout

---

## Supporting Cast Appearances

| Character | Function | Key Line |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Mayor Kringle | Pressure source | Assigned Eben without telling Noel |
| Wes Candle | Gossip/support | "He's been staring at you for ten minutes." |
| Hugh Everhart | Comic chaos | "You two make a very efficient picture." |

---

## Continuity Notes

**Establish:**
- Eben removes gloves one finger at a time (callback potential)
- "Temporary" promise (pays off EP12)
- Noel's refusal to ask for help (wound pattern)
- Eben clocks Noel's exhaustion (establishes caretaking impulse)

**Avoid:**
- No kiss
- No explicit touching beyond accidental
- Don't reveal Eben's backstory yet

## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"Noel Merrick had been awake for thirty-seven hours and was handling it fine. This was a lie, but it was a festive lie, so it counted."*
- *"There are two types of people in Tinsel Town: those who believe in Christmas magic, and Eben Frost."*
- *"The Merryweather Festival had survived two world wars, one very aggressive squirrel, and the Great Tinsel Shortage of 1987. It had never, however, survived Noel Merrick running on four hours of sleep and pure spite."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **Mayor Kringle's panic spiral** - He speaks entirely in holiday metaphors when stressed
2. **Hugh + glitter = inevitable** - First appearance should involve sparkle disaster
3. **Eben's clipboard** - He has one. He takes notes. Noel hates this.
4. **Wes as chaos narrator** - Running commentary from the coffee counter
5. **The vendor crisis** - Something catches fire? Someone brings the wrong animal? Peak festival chaos

### Snarky Character Observations
- Eben on Noel: *"He smiled like someone who had learned to do it from a book and then practiced until it stopped looking terrifying. It almost worked."*
- Noel on Eben: *"He had the energy of a man who alphabetized his underwear and judged people silently for not doing the same."*
- Narrator on both: *"They hated each other immediately. It was going to be a beautiful disaster."*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"I don't need a handler."
"I'm not a handler. I'm logistics."
"You're holding a clipboard with my name on it."
"That's organizational. Completely different."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold
- The moment Eben removes his gloves, one finger at a time, while making direct eye contact
- Noel's internal monologue during crisis: *"This is fine. This is fine. This is very much not fine. This is—oh god, is that actual fire?"*
- Wes, observing: *"They're going to either kiss or commit murder. Either way, I'm making popcorn."*

### Holiday Coziness Moments
- First glimpse of Evergreen Square fully lit
- Wes handing Noel coffee without being asked
- The quiet after the chaos when the lights come on
- Snow starting to fall as they agree to continue "temporarily"
