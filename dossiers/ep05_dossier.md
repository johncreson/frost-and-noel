## Motifs Active

- **Rings (title):** Commitment imagery

## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"The sponsor assumed they were a couple. To be fair, they were standing too close together, had matching exhaustion, and were covered in traces of mutual glitter. An understandable mistake."*
- *"Fake dating was supposed to be simple. Noel had read about it. There were rules. None of those rules prepared him for the moment someone flirted with him and Eben's entire face went cold."*
- *"Jealousy, Eben had decided, was a ridiculous emotion. He wasn't jealous. He was simply... observing. Intensely. With his jaw clenched."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **The sponsor assumption** - Just two dudes, standing too close, with heart eyes
2. **Fake dating rules** - They make a list. They break every single one.
3. **Eben's jealousy face** - He thinks he's hiding it. He is not hiding it.
4. **Hugh: "This is fascinating"** - Watching the disaster unfold with glee
5. **The photo pose** - "Look natural!" Neither of them knows how.

### Snarky Character Observations
- Noel on fake dating: *"They were professionals pretending to be a couple for professional reasons. The fact that they had already slept together was irrelevant. Probably."*
- Eben on jealousy: *"He was not jealous. The man talking to Noel was simply standing too close, speaking too loudly, and existing too aggressively."*
- Narrator on the photos: *"They smiled for the sponsor. It looked almost convincing if you ignored that their eyes were doing something complicated and probably illegal."*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"You're jealous."
"I'm not jealous."
"Your hand is on my back."
"That's positioning."
"It wasn't there before he started talking to me."
"...Coincidence."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold
- The first "Sit. Good." moment. Just—all of it.
- Eben realizing he's blown his cover: *"Well. That was embarrassing."*
- Noel, breathless: *"Unless you don't want it to be fake."*

### Holiday Coziness Moments  
- Reception lights making everything golden
- Hand-holding for the cameras (and then not letting go)
- The quiet after the sponsor leaves
- Snow falling as they walk home (still too close)
