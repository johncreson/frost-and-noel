## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"Christmas morning. Tangled in someone you almost lost, in sheets that smell like relief, watching snow fall through the window. Hallmark could never."*
- *"They saved the festival twelve times in twelve days. The thirteenth save was saving each other. That one stuck."*
- *"Eben Frost removed his gloves in front of the entire town. For those keeping score at home, this was the romantic equivalent of a public proposal."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **Mayor Kringle: "You fixed it."** - The TENSION. His digestion.
2. **Hugh's commentary on the gloves** - "Oh, he's serious."
3. **The crowd erupting** - Tinsel Town ships them HARD
4. **"Move in with me" / "Better water pressure"** - Peak Eben romance
5. **Celebration sex includes laughing** - Joy as intimacy

### Snarky Character Observations
- Mayor on the situation: *"'Oh thank goodness. You fixed it.' The 'it' was unclear. The tension? Their relationship? His acid reflux? All of the above, probably."*
- On glove removal: *"He removed his gloves like he was defusing a bomb. One finger at a time. The crowd held its breath. Hugh whispered, 'Oh, he's serious.' He was."*
- Celebration sex: *"It was joyful sex. Laughing sex. 'Remember when I hated you?' 'You never hated me.' 'Fine, strongly disliked.' 'Also untrue.' 'Shut up and—' 'Yeah.'"*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"Move in with me."
"What?"
"My place has better water pressure."
"That's your argument?"
"It's a compelling argument."
"..."
"Okay."
"Okay?"
"Let's do that."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold (The HEA Edition)
- "This isn't temporary." - In front of everyone. Hand bare. Heart out.
- "It's not temporary." / "No. It never was." - THE callback. THE payoff.
- Final line: *"Noel Merrick—finally, completely—let himself be loved without earning it first."*
