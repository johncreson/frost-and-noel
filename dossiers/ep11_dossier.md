## Heat Content

**Level:** Repair Sex

**Dynamic:** Intimacy as accountability + choice

**Key beats:**
- Apology first, then physical
- Kiss is careful at first, then real
- More verbal than any previous scene
- "Tell me you're staying." / "I'm staying."
- "Say my name." / "Noel."
- "I'm sorry" woven through

**Aftercare:** Built into the scene; holding all night

## Continuity Notes

**Establish:**
- "I need you" = completes EP7's unfinished sentence
- "I'm choosing you" = Eben's arc complete
- "That okay counts" = callback to Wes/Sam novella
- Repair sex = full of words (unlike rupture's silence)

**Build from EP10:**
- Eben's realization: "I have to fix this"
- Town knows and is tired of the drama

**Set up for EP12:**
- Together for Christmas
- Tomorrow = finale parade
- Public claim coming

## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"Christmas Eve, and Noel Merrick was going to be brave if it killed him. Which it might. Emotionally, at least."*
- *"The town intervention was not subtle. Tinsel Town had never been subtle. Subtlety was for places without names like 'Kringle' and 'Everhart.'"*
- *"'It's Christmas Eve. Stop being tragic.' Hugh said this like it was reasonable relationship advice. Which, honestly, it kind of was."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **Twin interventions** - Wes and Sam, simultaneously, no coordination
2. **Hugh's blunt wisdom** - "Stop being tragic" = holiday spirit
3. **Eben trying to apologize** - Words hard. Feelings harder.
4. **The whole town watching** - Everyone knows. Everyone has opinions.
5. **"That okay counts"** - Callback to Wes/Sam, inside joke payoff

### Snarky Character Observations
- Wes to Noel: *"You look like roadkill. Fix it."* Narrator: *Wes Candle: baker, friend, motivational speaker.*
- Eben attempting words: *"He had rehearsed this. It had sounded better in his head. Everything always sounded better in his head where Noel wasn't looking at him with those eyes."*
- On repair sex: *"This was different. This had words. This had 'I'm sorry' and 'I know' and 'Stay' and 'I'm staying.' This was words as the scene, not just before it."*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"What do you want, Eben?"
"You."
"..."
"I want you. I'm scared. I'm choosing you anyway."
"..."
"You're supposed to respond."
"I'm having a moment."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold (The Catharsis Edition)
- "I lied." - Two words. Everything opens.
- "I need you." - FINALLY. The sentence from EP7, finished.
- "That okay counts." - Callback. Full circle. Perfect.

### Holiday Coziness Moments (Restored)
- Snow falling on Christmas Eve
- Holding in bed, finally back together
- "I stay." Simple. True.
- Falling asleep Christmas Eve with hope again
