- Eben knowing Noel's coffee order = attentiveness
- Glitter specs = callback potential

- "Temporary" still unaddressed
- Working relationship established

**Set up for EP3:**

## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"Noel had spent all night not thinking about Eben Frost. This required such an aggressive amount of not-thinking that he'd barely slept, which rather defeated the purpose."*
- *"The problem with kissing someone you're supposed to hate is that your brain doesn't get the memo. It just sits there, replaying the moment like a misbehaving screensaver."*
- *"Hugh's craft committee had a glitter emergency. This was the most Hugh sentence Noel had ever heard."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **Everhart Crafts glitter ambush** - They're covered in sparkles for the rest of the day
2. **The tiny office** - Knees touching, no escape, maximum awkwardness
3. **Eben knowing Noel's coffee order** - He "overheard it." Sure, buddy.
4. **Hugh's complete lack of subtlety** - "Sorry, glitter emergency!" while clearly matchmaking
5. **The parking lot aftermath** - Two adults sitting in separate cars, screaming internally

### Snarky Character Observations
- Noel's internal: *"He made coffee. That doesn't mean anything. People make coffee. It's a normal thing. Stop reading into coffee."*
- Eben's internal: *"He's watching. Stop watching him watching. Stop watching entirely. Why is this so difficult."*
- Narrator on tiny office: *"The room was approximately the size of a confession booth, which felt appropriate given what was about to happen."*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"You look tired."
"Thank you for that observation."
"I'm noting it for the record."
"We don't have a record."
"We do now."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold
- Eben saying "Noel" for the first time like he's admitting something terrible
- The kiss itself: *"Neither of them was sure who moved first. It probably didn't matter. What mattered was that Eben's hand was on Noel's jaw and Noel was gripping Eben's collar and someone needed to explain to the room why it was suddenly so small."*
- Post-kiss silence: *"Well," Eben said, after approximately seventeen years. "That happened."*

### Holiday Coziness Moments
- Coffee steam in the cold morning
- Glitter catching the light despite their best efforts
- The quiet of the tiny office at midnight
- Walking out together into falling snow, not touching, very much wanting to
