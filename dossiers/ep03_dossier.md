## Heat Content

**Level:** First Full Sex Scene

**Dynamic:** Tender, emotionally revealing
- Eben leads physically; Noel surrenders verbally
- Not frantic—deliberate, meaningful
- Eye contact throughout

**Consent moments:**
- "Do you want this?" → "Yes."
- "Tell me if you want me to stop."
- "Yes. Please."

**Key beats:**
1. Desperate kissing
2. Clothes loosened (imperfect, first-time energy)
3. Hands on skin
4. "Look at me" moment at peak
5. Eye contact maintained
6. Release with vulnerability

**Aftercare:**
- Eben cleans them up
- Drapes Noel's coat over his shoulders
- "Are you okay?"

## Key Dialogue

| Character | Line | Context |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Noel | "I want to." | Addressing the kiss |
| Eben | "Look at me." | During intimacy |
| Eben | "Are you okay?" | Aftercare |
| Noel | "I don't know." | Honest vulnerability |

---

## Motifs Active

- **Flour:** Comic disaster → carried through
- **Kindness revealed:** Eben's hidden softness
- **Weather:** Snow falling = romantic charge

---

## Cozy Textures

- **Smell:** Baking, sugar, flour, Eben's coat
- **Tactile:** Flour on skin, cold walk, warm office
- **Light:** Bakery warmth → evening snow → dim office
- **Food:** Bake-off treats (neither eats much—nervous)

---

| Character | Function | Key Line |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Wes Candle | Host, observer | Notices everything |
| Hugh Everhart | Flour chaos | Causes the disaster |
| Sam Rook | Cameo | Nods approvingly |

## Continuity Notes

**Establish:**
- First sex scene = tender, consent-forward
- Eben's unexpected kindness to stranger
- "I don't know" = honest about overwhelm

**Build from EP2:**
- Kiss addressed directly
- "I want to" = consent + desire named

**Set up for EP4:**

## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"They were going to be professional about this. They were adults. Adults who had done adult things together and were now pretending it hadn't happened. Very adult behavior."*
- *"The Candle & Crumb Bakery smelled like cinnamon and poor life choices. Noel was intimately familiar with both."*
- *"Hugh caused the flour disaster, but honestly, the flour disaster was probably going to happen anyway. It was that kind of day."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **The flour explosion** - Everyone is white. Everything is white. Hugh is delighted.
2. **Competitive baking chaos** - Someone's fondant sculpture collapses. Someone cries.
3. **Wes's knowing looks** - He sees everything. He says nothing. He sees everything.
4. **Eben being unexpectedly good with the nervous baker** - Noel short-circuits watching this
5. **The walk home** - Two people who definitely know where this is going pretending they don't

### Snarky Character Observations  
- Noel on Eben helping the baker: *"Great. Perfect. The man he couldn't stop thinking about was also secretly kind. This was fine. He was fine."*
- Eben's internal when Noel laughs: *"That laugh was going to be a problem. Eben could already tell. He added it to the list of Noel-related problems, which was getting concerningly long."*
- Narrator: *"They were covered in flour and making eyes at each other across a ruined bake-off. Romance, probably."*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"You have flour in your hair."
"You have flour on your face."
"We both look ridiculous."
"Yes."
"..."
"Why are you smiling?"
"I'm not. That's the flour."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold (Spicy)
- First "Do you want this?" moment should land like a drumroll
- "Look at me." - Two words. All the power.
- Afterglow: *"Are you okay?" Because of course he asked. Because of course Eben Frost, emotionally constipated glacier man, asked if Noel was okay after making him fall apart.*

### Holiday Coziness Moments
- The bakery covered in twinkling lights
- Flour-speckled laughter
- Walking through snow together, close enough to touch
- The warmth of Noel's office/apartment after the cold
