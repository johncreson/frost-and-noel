**Dynamic:** Quiet touch, verbal check-in that goes wrong

**Key moments:**
- No sex this episode
- Emotional intimacy attempt fails
- Scarf exchange = signature physical moment

**The scarf beat:**
- Eben's scarf falls while fixing equipment
- Noel picks it up, wraps around his own neck
- After the save, realizes he's still wearing it
- Doesn't take it off

## Key Dialogue

| Character | Line | Context |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Noel | "Was last night a mistake?" | Direct question |
| Eben | "No." | First answer (honest) |
| Eben | "This should stay between us." | The boundary |
| Eben | "It's easier." | The lie (they both know) |

---

## Motifs Active

- **Scarf:** New motif—Noel wearing Eben's scarf (claimed)
- **"Between us":** Becomes loaded phrase
- **Music/voices:** Caroling = public joy vs private pain

---

## Cozy Textures

## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"Noel woke up alone, which was fine. Normal. The sheets on the other side were cold. Also fine. He was going to be absolutely, aggressively fine about this."*
- *"Eben's coping mechanism was distance, which was inconvenient given that his current assignment required him to be within arm's reach of the one person he desperately needed distance from."*
- *"The sound system failed during the caroling. Because of course it did."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **The scarf heist** - Noel accidentally steals Eben's scarf. Keeps it. Says nothing.
2. **Hugh's "creepy telepathy" observation** - Calling it like he sees it  
3. **Sound system disaster** - Maximum chaos, minimum preparation, they're professionals
4. **The crowd's obliviousness** - Everyone singing while tech disaster unfolds backstage
5. **Mayor Kringle's photo comment** - "Great chemistry!" SIR.

### Snarky Character Observations
- Noel waking up alone: *"He was not disappointed. That would require him to have had expectations, and expectations required hope, and hope required—nope. Not going there. Coffee first."*
- Eben's cold act: *"Professional distance. Crisp. Efficient. He was doing a stellar job of pretending last night hadn't fundamentally rearranged his understanding of physical chemistry."*
- On the scarf: *"It smelled like Eben. Noel was absolutely not thinking about this. He was also not taking it off."*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"Was last night a mistake?"
"No."
"Then what is this?"
"...Complicated."
"That's not an answer."
"It's the one I have."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold
- "This should stay between us" - the sound of a heart quietly cracking
- Hugh: *"You two are telepathic now. It's creepy."* - No filter. No regrets.
- Noel's internal at the scarf: *"I'm keeping it. Shut up."*

### Holiday Coziness Moments
- Fairy lights strung across Evergreen Square
- Mulled cider warming cold hands
- The crowd's singing filling the night
- Walking home alone, but wearing his scarf
