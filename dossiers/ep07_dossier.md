## Heat Content

**Level:** Emotional Intimacy Spike (gentler, verbal)

**Dynamic:** Tender; verbal reassurance; no rush

**Key moments:**
- Eben removes coat, sweater to warm Noel during first aid
- Physical gentleness (bandaging, checking face)
- Skin-on-skin warmth (platonic but intimate)
- "You don't have to be fine."
- Cocoa together, close—town glancing at them
- Hand covering hand
- "You could stay." "I want."

**This episode is about emotional intimacy AND public exposure**

## Key Dialogue

| Character | Line | Context |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Eben | "You don't have to be fine." | Permission |
| Noel | "I need—" | Unfinished (finishes EP11) |
| Noel | "You could stay." | First overnight request |
| Eben | "I want." | Simple yes |
| Town member | "Saw the photo. You two are *cute*." | Scandal confirmation |

---

## Motifs Active

- **Ice/gliding/falling:** Physical vulnerability
- **Bandaged wrist:** Visible in later episodes
- **Being caught:** Both by camera and by care
- **Scandal/exposure:** Public vs private selves

---

## Cozy Textures

- **Smell:** Ice, cocoa, cold air, skin
- **Tactile:** Wrapped wrist, warm drinks, Eben's hands, body warmth
- **Light:** Winter sun, rink lights, phone flash, Garland warmth, apartment
- **Food:** Cocoa at Garland Cup

## Supporting Cast Appearances

| Character | Function | Key Line |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Hugh | Background chaos | At the rink |
| Wes | Wisdom + observation | "Photo's already going around." |
| Photo-taker | Scandal catalyst | Face unseen; phone visible |
| Families | Setting | Skating community |

---

## Continuity Notes

**Establish:**
- **Photo incident** = scandal seed (sets up EP9)
- "I need—" = unfinished (MUST complete in EP11)
- Bandaged wrist = visible callback
- First overnight stay request
- Eben's caretaking fully unlocked
- Town gossip machine activated

**Build from EP6:**
- "It's real" = now living that
- Trust continuing to deepen

**Set up for EP9:**
- EP7 photo + EP5 sponsor photos = double exposure
- Town already saw intimate moment
- Mayor uses photos innocently → explosion

## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"Noel was fine. He was also on the ice, with a twisted wrist, surrounded by concerned children, and being stared at by Eben Frost like he'd personally offended him by having a body that could be injured."*
- *"The problem with being taken care of is that it requires admitting you need care. Noel would rather ice skate into traffic."*
- *"Someone took a photo. Eben would spend the next twenty-four hours pretending this was fine. It was not fine. It was currently circulating through Tinsel Town's group chats like a festive virus."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **Kid witnesses the fall** - "Are you okay mister?" "Fine!" *internal screaming*
2. **Eben's concerned face** - He thinks it's neutral. It is Murder Mode.
3. **The photo moment** - Eben sees the phone too late. Phone disappears. Dread.
4. **Wes breaking the news** - "Photo's already going around. You look cozy."
5. **Noel's allergy to being helped** - Actively feral about it
6. **First overnight request** - Casual! The town already knows! (Not casual at all.)

### Snarky Character Observations
- Noel being treated: *"He was not good at receiving care. The last time someone had tried to fuss over him, he'd hidden in a supply closet. He was a work in progress."*
- Eben's internal on the photo: *"Someone had taken a picture. Eben was going to be extremely calm about this. He was also going to find that phone and destroy it. Very calmly."*
- Narrator: *"They drank cocoa like two people who were absolutely not thinking about the photo currently making its way through every phone in a fifty-mile radius."*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"You don't have to be fine."
"I'm always fine."
"That's not what I asked."
"..."
"Noel."
"...I don't know how to not be fine."
```

```
"There's a photo."
"I saw."
"The whole town—"
"I know."
"Are we going to address—"
"Not tonight. Please."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold
- "I need—" *cuts off* - THE UNFINISHED SENTENCE. We will remember this.
- "You could stay." - finally. FINALLY.
- Eben's simple: "I want." - No conditions. No escape hatch.
- Wes: "Saw the photo. You two look *cozy*." - Maximum calm. Maximum chaos.

### Holiday Coziness Moments
- Ice rink lights reflecting on the snow
- Bandaged wrist and warm cocoa
- The walk home, close enough to touch, town watching
- First night staying over (actually sleeping, together, holding)
