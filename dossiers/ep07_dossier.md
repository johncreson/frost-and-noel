## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"Noel was fine. He was also on the ice, with a twisted wrist, surrounded by concerned children, and being stared at by Eben Frost like he'd personally offended him by having a body that could be injured."*
- *"The problem with being taken care of is that it requires admitting you need care. Noel would rather ice skate into traffic."*
- *"Eben bandaged Noel's wrist like he was disarming a bomb. Which, emotionally, he kind of was."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **Kid witnesses the fall** - "Are you okay mister?" "Fine!" *internal screaming*
2. **Eben's concerned face** - He thinks it's neutral. It is Murder Mode. 
3. **The cocoa situation** - Holding cups. Not touching. Very much wanting to.
4. **Noel's allergy to being helped** - Actively feral about it
5. **First overnight request** - Casual! Totally casual! (Not casual at all.)

### Snarky Character Observations
- Noel being treated: *"He was not good at receiving care. The last time someone had tried to fuss over him, he'd hidden in a supply closet. He was a work in progress."*
- Eben's internal: *"Stop looking at me like that. I'm just wrapping a bandage. This is not—why are your eyes doing that."*
- Narrator: *"They drank cocoa like two people who were absolutely not thinking about the other person's mouth. Very convincing."*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"You don't have to be fine."
"I'm always fine."
"That's not what I asked."
"..."
"Noel."
"...I don't know how to not be fine."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold
- "I need—" *cuts off* - THE UNFINISHED SENTENCE. We will remember this.
- "You could stay." - finally. FINALLY.
- Eben's simple: "I want." - No conditions. No escape hatch.

### Holiday Coziness Moments
- Ice rink lights reflecting on the snow
- Bandaged wrist and warm cocoa  
- The walk home, close enough to touch
- First night staying over (actually sleeping, together, holding)
