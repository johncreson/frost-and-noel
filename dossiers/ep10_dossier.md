## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"The storm arrived like a metaphor. Eben would have appreciated it more if he wasn't standing in the middle of a charity event watching Noel pretend he was fine while clearly not fine."*
- *"Frost Line Logistics was not designed for emotional confrontations. It was designed for pallets and shipping manifests. And yet."*
- *"Sam Rook had the energy of a man who had seen some things, fixed some things, and was about to say some things Eben desperately did not want to hear."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **The storm as character** - Perfectly timed chaos
2. **Frost Line as shelter** - Everyone in Eben's personal space. His nightmare.
3. **Sam's confrontation** - No filter, no mercy, all truth
4. **Noel's autopilot** - Smile so bright it's clearly broken
5. **The almost-touch** - Reaching. Not quite. Worse than nothing.

### Snarky Character Observations
- Noel operating on fumes: *"This is fine. This is normal. I am a functioning person doing functioning things."* Narrator: *He was not.*
- Eben watching from across the room: *"He's smiling. It's the worst smile Eben has ever seen. It's the smile of someone who has given up."*
- Sam showing no mercy: *"'You're destroying something before it can hurt you.' Sam said it like he was commenting on the weather. Eben felt it like a gut punch."*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"You're doing that thing."
"What thing."
"The thing where you ruin everything before it can ruin you."
"..."
"Yeah. That thing."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold
- "Not today. Please." - Voice cracking. Heart showing.
- Sam: "Wes told me you were good for Noel. I believed him. Was he wrong?"
- Eben alone in empty warehouse: *"I have to fix this. Tomorrow. Christmas Eve."*

### Holiday Yearning Moments
- Storm forcing proximity with no resolution
- Hot coffee in cold hands, silence between them
- Noel in Eben's space (first time), leaving first
- The quiet after everyone's gone
