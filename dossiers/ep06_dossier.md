## 🎄 HOLIDAY FUN ELEMENTS

### Witty Narrator Hooks
Opening line options:
- *"The goats escaped four times. This was considered a moderate success for a farm charity event."*
- *"Eben Frost, logistics professional and emotional fortress, was currently being climbed by a baby goat. Noel was taking photos."*
- *"There's something about watching a man gently help a terrified child approach a lamb that rearranges your entire understanding of him. Noel was having that experience now and deeply resenting it."*

### Comedy Beats to Lean Into
1. **Goat chaos (x4)** - Every time they catch them, they escape again
2. **Eben + baby goat** - Dignity lost. Photos taken. Evidence documented.
3. **Scarf wrapper 2.0** - Eben wrapping Noel in his scarf like a burrito
4. **Noel's internal meltdown watching Eben be kind** - Not okay. Not okay at all.
5. **The barn** - Peak romance novel energy. They both know it.

### Snarky Character Observations
- Noel watching Eben with the lamb: *"Great. Perfect. Emotionally unavailable glacier man was also good with children and animals. Noel's type, apparently, was 'everything he thought he didn't want.'"*
- Eben on wrapping Noel: *"He was cold. This was practical. The way Noel looked at him afterward was not practical and Eben was choosing to ignore it."*
- Narrator: *"The barn smelled like hay and romantic clichés. Someone should probably address that."*

### Deadpan Dialogue Gems
```
"You're cold."
"I'm fine."
"Your lips are blue."
"That's normal."
"Get over here."
"That's not—"
"Now."
"...Okay."
```

### Read-Aloud Gold  
- "I'm not going to guess, Noel." - The power in that line.
- "I want this to be real." - Finally. FINALLY.
- "It's real." - Two words. Everything changes.

### Holiday Coziness Moments
- Golden hour on the farm
- Hay bales and fairy lights
- Scarf-wrapped and close
- Driving home in comfortable silence
