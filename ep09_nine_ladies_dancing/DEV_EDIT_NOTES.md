# EP09 Developmental Edit Notes
## Nine Ladies Dancing — The Rupture

---

## Executive Summary

**Draft Status:** Strong emotional foundation, needs technical cleanup
**Major Issues:** Encoding (mojibake), missing POV markers
**Word Count:** ~8,901 (target 10k-12k — slightly short)
**Recommendation:** Light revision pass focused on fixes, not rewrites

---

## Technical Issues

### 1. Encoding (ALL CHAPTERS)
Replace mojibake:
- `â€"` → `—` (em-dash)
- `â€™` → `'` (apostrophe)
- `Iâ€"` → `I—`

### 2. Missing POV Markers (ALL CHAPTERS)
Add after each chapter heading:
| Chapter | POV |
|---------|-----|
| 1: Morning Bliss | **NOEL** |
| 2: Gala Prep | **DUAL** (starts NOEL, switches EBEN) |
| 3: The Photo Reveal | **NOEL** |
| 4: The Snap | **EBEN** |
| 5: The Wound Strike | **EBEN** |
| 6: The Cold | **NOEL** |
| 7: Hook Ending | **EBEN** |

### 3. Chapter Numbering
Change from `01`, `02` → `1`, `2` etc.

## Content Analysis

### What's Working ✅
- **Rupture timing:** Photo reveal → public humiliation → private fight → catastrophic words
- **Eben's freeze response:** Consistent with EP08 fear seed ("How long before I ruin this?")
- **Noel's "okay":** Perfect wound activation (flat acceptance = expecting rejection)
- **Hook ending:** "He just hadn't expected to be the one trapped inside" — devastating
- **Ribbon symbolism:** Still on Noel's wrist at end = can't let go yet

### Potential Issues to Address

#### A. Repetition Patterns (Monitor, Don't Over-Fix)
These are intentional echo effects but watch for excess:
- "This was never supposed to last" — appears 8+ times (this is the wound strike, keep)
- "walls" — appears 6+ times in Ch7 (trim 1-2)
- "blank/empty/numb" — clusters in Ch5-6 (okay, reflects emotional state)

#### B. Pacing Check
- **Ch3/4 split:** Works. Ch3 = public humiliation, Ch4 = private confrontation
- **Ch5/6/7 all end on similar beats** (alone, dark, regret) — this is intentional for rupture episode

## Continuity Checklist

- [x] Work email from EP08 → led to Eben's fear (not explicitly mentioned, but implied)
- [x] Ribbon motif → still on Noel's wrist, now "felt like a scar"
- [x] "I love you" from EP08 → referenced ("He said he loved me")
- [x] Fear seed → "How long before I ruin this?" answered in Ch5
- [x] EP10 setup → both characters separated, rock bottom

## Revision Priorities

### Must Fix
1. ✅ Encoding (all chapters)
2. ✅ POV markers (all chapters)
3. ✅ Chapter numbering (01→1)

### Should Review
4. Trim 1-2 "walls" repetitions in Ch7
5. Consider whether word count needs expansion (currently 8.9k, target 10k)

### Leave Alone
- "This was never supposed to last" repetition (wound strike)
- "okay" repetition (Noel's shutdown response)
- Dark/empty tone (appropriate for rupture episode)

## Next Steps
1. Create rev_1 folder
2. Fix encoding in all chapters
3. Add POV markers
4. Light repetition trim
5. Compile and generate KDP DOCX
