## Chapter 03: The Photo Reveal

The first photo was fine.

Professional. Clean. Noel and Eben standing in front of the festival banner, looking competent and organized.

The second photo was fine too.

Them at the market. Smiling. Surrounded by vendors and holiday cheer.

The third photo—

The third photo was not fine.

It was the one from the sponsor event. The one where they'd been talking, and someone had caught them mid-conversation. The one where Eben was looking at Noel like he was the only person in the room.

The one where Noel was looking back the same way.

The one that said everything.

The screen was huge. The photo was unavoidable. And the entire room could see it.

Noel's heart stopped.

---

The crowd's reaction was immediate.

Whispers. Knowing smiles. A few delighted gasps.

"Oh my god, finally!" someone said.

"I knew it!"

"They're so cute together!"

Mayor Kringle, oblivious, beamed at the screen. "Aren't they wonderful? Such a great partnership!"

Partnership.

Right.

That's what this was.

Except the photo on the screen said otherwise.

And everyone in the room knew it.

---

Noel stood frozen.

His brain had stopped working. His body had stopped working. Everything had just—stopped.

This wasn't supposed to happen.

They weren't supposed to be *public* yet.

They hadn't talked about it. Hadn't decided how to handle it. Hadn't agreed on what to say or when to say it.

And now the entire town was looking at them.

Waiting.

Expecting.

Noel's throat closed.

He looked at Eben.

Eben was staring at the screen like it was a firing squad.

His face was blank. Carefully, deliberately blank.

The kind of blank that meant he was panicking.

*Say something,* Noel thought desperately. *Please. Just—say something.*

But Eben didn't move.

Didn't speak.

Didn't do anything.

He just stood there, frozen, while the entire room watched them.

---

"So?" someone called out. "When's the official announcement?"

The question hung in the air.

Noel's pulse hammered in his ears.

He looked at Eben again.

*Please.*

But Eben's jaw was locked. His shoulders rigid. His entire body screaming *run* even though his feet hadn't moved.

And Noel realized—with a sick, sinking certainty—that Eben wasn't going to say anything.

He was going to stand there and let Noel handle it.

He was going to leave Noel alone in the spotlight.

Again.

---

Noel's smile felt like it was cracking his face in half.

"Just teamwork," he heard himself say. His voice sounded wrong. Too bright. Too forced. "Nothing to announce."

The room went quiet.

Someone laughed awkwardly. "Come on. You can't tell me that photo is *just teamwork*."

"I mean—" Noel gestured vaguely at the screen. "We work well together. That's all."

"That's not what it looks like."

"Well. Looks can be deceiving."

The words tasted like ash.

Because he was lying.

He was standing in front of the entire town, looking at a photo that showed exactly how he felt about Eben, and he was lying.

Denying it.

Denying *them*.

Because Eben wouldn't confirm it.

---

Mayor Kringle, finally sensing the tension, cleared his throat. "Well! Regardless of—um—personal dynamics, we're very grateful for their hard work!"

He clicked to the next slide.

The moment passed.

People turned their attention back to the presentation.

But Noel could feel their eyes on him. Could hear the whispers.

Could feel the weight of what he'd just done.

He'd publicly denied them.

In front of everyone.

Because Eben had given him no choice.

---

Noel's hands were shaking.

He shoved them in his pockets. Kept his smile fixed. Pretended everything was fine.

But inside, he was breaking.

Because Eben had frozen.

When it mattered—when Noel needed him to step up, to say *something*, to acknowledge what they were—Eben had frozen.

And Noel had been left to clean up the mess alone.

Just like always.

---

The presentation continued.

Noel stood there, nodding at appropriate moments, making polite conversation, doing his job.

But he wasn't really there.

He was somewhere else.

Somewhere dark and familiar.

The place where his wound lived.

*You weren't enough. You're never enough.*

*You were useful for a while. That's all you ever are.*

The voice was quiet. Insidious. True.

Because if Noel was enough—if he mattered—Eben would have said something.

Would have claimed him.

Would have stood beside him instead of leaving him to face the crowd alone.

But he hadn't.

And Noel knew what that meant.

---

The presentation ended.

The sponsors applauded. Mayor Kringle looked relieved. The crowd dispersed, chattering about the gala and the festival and probably—definitely—about the photo.

Noel stood in the middle of it all, smiling, nodding, pretending.

Eben was across the room. Talking to someone. Looking calm and collected and completely unaffected.

Like nothing had happened.

Like he hadn't just destroyed Noel in front of everyone.

Noel's chest felt too tight.

He needed air.

He needed space.

He needed—

"Noel."

Eben's voice. Quiet. Careful.

Noel turned.

Eben was standing there, hands in his pockets, expression unreadable.

"We need to talk," Eben said.

"Yeah," Noel said. His voice sounded flat. Distant. "We do."

---

They found a private room.

One of the small offices off the main hall. Empty. Quiet.

The door closed behind them with a soft click.

And suddenly, the silence was deafening.

Noel stood with his back to the door. Eben stood near the window.

Neither of them spoke.

The air between them felt like glass. Fragile. Ready to shatter.

"Why didn't you say something?" Noel asked finally.

His voice was quiet. Controlled.

He was proud of that.

Proud that he didn't sound like he was breaking.

Even though he was.

"What was I supposed to say?" Eben's voice was just as quiet. Just as controlled.

"Anything. You could have said anything."

"Noel—"

"You just stood there. You didn't move. You didn't speak. You just—" Noel's hands clenched. "You left me alone."

"I didn't know what to say."

"You could have said yes. You could have said we're together. You could have—" Noel's voice cracked. "You could have not made me lie."

Eben flinched.

Good.

He should flinch.

"I didn't mean—"

"Didn't mean what? To make me deny us in front of the entire town? To stand there and watch me do it?"

"I panicked."

"I know you panicked! I could see you panicking! But you still didn't say anything!"

"I'm sorry."

"Are you?"

The question hung between them.

Eben's jaw tightened. "Yes. I'm sorry. I should have—I don't know. I should have done something."

"But you didn't."

"No. I didn't."

Noel laughed. It sounded bitter. "Right. Of course."

"Noel—"

"This isn't—" Noel stopped. Shook his head. "This isn't what I thought it was."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean this. Us. I thought—" His throat closed. "I thought it was real."

And there it was.

The question he'd been afraid to ask.

The fear he'd been trying to ignore.

Eben's face went pale. "It is real."

"Is it? Because it doesn't feel real right now. It feels like—" Noel's voice broke. "It feels like I'm the only one who wants this."

"That's not true."

"Then why didn't you say something?"

"I told you. I panicked."

"That's not good enough!"

"I know it's not good enough! I know I messed up! But I'm trying—"

"Trying what? To what, Eben?"

Eben opened his mouth.

Closed it.

And Noel saw it.

The exact moment Eben's walls slammed up.

The exact moment he retreated.

The exact moment Noel lost him.

"This was never supposed to—"

Eben stopped.

But the damage was done.

Noel went very still. "Finish the sentence."

"Noel—"

"Finish. The sentence."

Silence.

Noel's heart was pounding so hard it hurt.

"Was this ever real to you?" he asked quietly.

And waited for Eben to say yes.

Waited for Eben to explain.

Waited for Eben to fix this.

But Eben just stood there.

Silent.

Trapped.

And Noel knew—with absolute, devastating certainty—what was coming next.
