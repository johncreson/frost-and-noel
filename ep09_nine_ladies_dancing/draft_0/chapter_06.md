## Chapter 06: The Cold

Noel walked.

He didn't know where he was going. Didn't care.

He just needed to move. Needed to get away. Needed to not be in that room with Eben's words still hanging in the air.

*This was never supposed to last.*

The hallway was empty. Everyone was still in the main hall, preparing for tomorrow's gala.

Tomorrow.

He'd have to see Eben tomorrow.

Have to work beside him. Smile. Pretend everything was fine.

Pretend his heart wasn't shattered into a thousand pieces.

The thought made him want to laugh.

Or cry.

He wasn't sure which.

---

Noel found himself back in the main hall.

Empty now. The sponsors had left. The crowd had dispersed. Just the space, decorated and beautiful and completely silent.

The lights were still on. Twinkling. Festive.

It felt like a mockery.

Noel stood in the center of the hall, surrounded by Christmas cheer, and felt—

Nothing.

Numb.

Empty.

Like someone had reached inside him and scooped out everything that mattered.

---

*Of course.*

The thought was quiet. Familiar. True.

*Of course this was temporary.*

*He said so from the beginning.*

*I just didn't believe him.*

Noel's wound whispered through him, insidious and certain.

*You weren't enough. You're never enough.*

*You were useful for a while. That's all you ever are.*

And the worst part—the absolutely devastating part—was that it felt true.

Because if Noel had been enough, Eben would have said something.

Would have claimed him in front of the town.

Would have fought for them instead of freezing.

Would have chosen him instead of choosing fear.

But he hadn't.

And Noel knew what that meant.

---

He looked down at his wrist.

The ribbon was still there. Bright red against his skin.

A promise tied in silk.

Except it wasn't a promise.

It was a lie.

Noel's fingers moved to untie it.

Stopped.

He couldn't.

Not yet.

Not when it still felt like the only proof that any of it had been real.

That Eben had loved him, even if only for a moment.

That he'd mattered, even if only temporarily.

So he left it.

Left the ribbon on his wrist like a scar.

A reminder.

A warning.

*Don't forget this time. Don't let yourself believe.*

---

Noel's phone buzzed.

He pulled it out. A text from Hugh.

*You okay? Saw you leave.*

Noel stared at the message.

*You okay?*

No.

He wasn't okay.

He was breaking.

But he couldn't say that.

Couldn't admit it.

Couldn't let anyone see how completely he'd fallen apart.

So he typed back: *I'm fine. Just needed air.*

The lie came easily.

It always did.

*I'm fine* was Noel's default. His armor. His way of keeping people at a distance.

Even when he was drowning.

Even when he was breaking.

Even when he desperately needed someone to see through the lie and help him.

He sent the text.

Put his phone away.

And stood alone in the empty hall.

---

The silence was deafening.

No music. No voices. No laughter.

Just Noel and the twinkling lights and the weight of everything he'd just lost.

He should leave.

Should go home. Get some sleep. Prepare for tomorrow.

But he couldn't move.

Couldn't make his feet work.

Couldn't do anything except stand there and replay the conversation over and over.

*This was never supposed to last.*

*After the festival. That was always the plan.*

Eben's voice. Calm. Certain. Devastating.

And Noel's response: *Okay.*

That blank, accepting *okay* that meant his wound had won.

That meant he'd given up.

That meant he'd let Eben go without a fight.

---

He should have fought.

Should have yelled. Should have demanded answers. Should have made Eben explain what he actually meant instead of just accepting the worst possible interpretation.

But he hadn't.

Because deep down, Noel had been expecting this.

Had been waiting for it.

Had known—absolutely known—that this was how it would end.

Because good things didn't last.

Not for him.

Not when he was just—useful. Temporary. Convenient.

Not when he wasn't enough.

---

Noel's chest felt too tight.

His eyes burned.

But he didn't cry.

He just stood there.

Numb.

Empty.

Alone.

The way he'd always been.

The way he'd always known he would be.

Because that was the truth, wasn't it?

He could be charming. Helpful. Indispensable.

But he couldn't be loved.

Not really.

Not in a way that lasted.

Not in a way that mattered.

Eben had proven that.

Had looked at everything they'd built—all the mornings and the laughter and the vulnerability and the promises—and decided it wasn't enough.

Decided *Noel* wasn't enough.

And Noel had just—accepted it.

Because what else could he do?

---

The hall lights flickered.

Someone must be turning things off for the night.

Noel should go.

Should leave before someone found him standing here like a ghost.

But he couldn't move.

Couldn't make himself walk away from this space where, just hours ago, everything had been fine.

Where he'd been happy.

Where he'd believed—stupidly, naively—that he'd finally found something real.

Someone who saw him. Wanted him. Chose him.

But it had all been temporary.

Just like Eben said.

Just like Noel should have known.

---

His phone buzzed again.

Another text from Hugh: *If you need anything, I'm here.*

Noel stared at the message.

*I'm here.*

The words should comfort him.

Should remind him that he wasn't alone. That he had friends. That he mattered to people.

But all he could think was: *Eben's not here.*

*Eben left.*

*Eben chose fear over me.*

And that was the only thing that mattered.

---

Noel typed back: *Thanks. I'm okay.*

Another lie.

But what else could he say?

*I'm breaking. I'm not okay. I don't know how to be okay.*

*The person I love just destroyed me and I let him.*

*I'm standing in an empty hall trying to figure out how to breathe.*

No.

He couldn't say any of that.

So he said: *I'm okay.*

And hoped that if he said it enough times, it might become true.

---

The lights went out.

One section at a time.

The hall growing darker. Quieter. Emptier.

Noel stood in the dimming light and thought: *This is what the end looks like.*

Not dramatic. Not explosive.

Just—quiet.

Just standing alone in the dark, watching the lights go out one by one.

Just accepting that the thing you wanted most is gone.

And there's nothing you can do to get it back.

---

Noel finally moved.

Walked toward the exit.

Each step felt heavy. Deliberate. Wrong.

Like he was walking away from something important.

But there was nothing left to stay for.

Eben had made that clear.

*This was never supposed to last.*

So Noel left.

Walked out into the cold December night.

Alone.

The way he'd started.

The way he'd always known he'd end up.

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

He didn't take it off.

Not yet.

Not when it was the only thing keeping him tethered to the memory of what it felt like to be loved.

Even if only for a moment.

Even if only temporarily.

Even if it had all been a lie.

He walked home through the dark streets.

And didn't cry.

He just went numb.

And told himself he was fine.

Over and over.

Until the words lost all meaning.

Until he almost believed them.

Almost.
