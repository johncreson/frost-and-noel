## Chapter 07: Hook Ending

Eben drove.

He didn't remember getting in his car. Didn't remember leaving Merryweather Hall.

He just found himself on the dark roads outside town, headlights cutting through the December night, and no idea where he was going.

Anywhere.

Nowhere.

Away.

---

The roads were empty.

Everyone was home. Warm. Safe. Preparing for Christmas.

Everyone except Eben.

Who was driving through the dark, replaying the worst conversation of his life, trying to figure out how he'd managed to destroy everything that mattered in less than ten minutes.

*This was never supposed to last.*

He'd said it.

Out loud.

To Noel's face.

And he hadn't meant it.

Not the way it sounded.

Not the way Noel had heard it.

What he'd meant was: *This wasn't supposed to get this serious. This intense. I wasn't supposed to fall this hard.*

But that's not what he'd said.

And now Noel thought—

Noel thought it had all been a lie.

Thought Eben had been planning to leave all along.

Thought he didn't matter.

And Eben had let him think it.

Had stood there and watched Noel's face go blank and hadn't corrected him.

Hadn't fought.

Hadn't explained.

Had just—let him go.

---

Eben pulled over.

Parked on the side of the road. Engine still running. Headlights illuminating nothing but empty darkness.

He sat there, hands on the wheel, and tried to breathe.

*What did I just do?*

He'd panicked. That's what happened.

The photos appeared. The crowd cheered. And Eben's entire body had gone into fight-or-flight mode.

Except he couldn't fight.

And he couldn't flee.

So he'd just—frozen.

Had stood there like a coward while Noel handled it alone.

While Noel smiled and deflected and denied them in front of everyone.

Because Eben hadn't given him any other choice.

---

And then the confrontation.

The private room. The questions. The fear.

*Was this ever real to you?*

Yes.

God, yes.

It was the most real thing Eben had ever had.

But he couldn't say it.

Couldn't make the words come out.

Because saying it meant admitting how much he needed it.

How much he needed Noel.

How completely and utterly terrified he was of losing it.

And Eben didn't know how to be that vulnerable.

Didn't know how to need someone that much.

Didn't know how to trust that it wouldn't destroy him.

So instead, he'd destroyed it himself.

---

*This was never supposed to last.*

The words echoed in his head. Over and over.

A lie he'd told to protect himself.

A lie that had become a weapon.

A lie that had cost him everything.

Because Noel had believed him.

Had taken those words at face value and walked away.

Had said *okay* in that flat, devastated voice and left.

And Eben had let him.

---

He should go back.

Should find Noel. Explain. Apologize.

Should tell him the truth: *I love you. I want this. I'm just terrified.*

But he couldn't.

Because what if Noel didn't believe him?

What if the damage was already done?

What if Eben had finally pushed too hard, run too far, destroyed the one thing he couldn't afford to lose?

The thought made him sick.

---

Eben turned off the engine.

Sat in the dark.

And faced the truth.

He'd spent his entire life building walls to keep people out.

Had perfected the art of not needing anyone.

Had convinced himself that attachment was dangerous. That vulnerability was weakness. That the only way to survive was to stay unattached.

And it had worked.

For years, it had worked.

He'd been safe. Protected. Invulnerable.

And completely, utterly alone.

Until Noel.

---

Noel, who'd slipped past every defense Eben had.

Who'd made him laugh. Made him care. Made him want to stay.

Who'd looked at all of Eben's sharp edges and careful distance and said: *I see you. And I'm not going anywhere.*

Who'd been patient. Kind. Willing to wait while Eben figured out how to let him in.

Who'd trusted Eben with his own wounds. His own fears. His own carefully hidden vulnerabilities.

Who'd said *I love you* first.

Who'd tied a ribbon on Eben's wrist and asked him to stay.

And Eben had said yes.

Had meant it.

Had wanted—desperately—to be the kind of person who could keep that promise.

But when it mattered—when he'd had the chance to prove it—he'd frozen.

Had let fear win.

Had chosen his walls over Noel.

And now Noel was gone.

---

Eben's phone buzzed.

He pulled it out. A text from Sam.

*Heard what happened. You okay?*

Eben stared at the message.

*You okay?*

No.

He wasn't okay.

He'd just destroyed the best thing in his life because he was too scared to keep it.

But he couldn't say that.

So he didn't respond.

Just put the phone away and sat in the dark.

---

The pattern was so clear now.

So obvious.

Destroy it before it destroys you.

That's what he did. What he'd always done.

Someone got too close, and he pushed them away.

Someone made him feel too much, and he shut down.

Someone made him want to stay, and he found a reason to leave.

It was survival. Protection. The only way he knew how to keep himself safe.

Except—

Except it didn't keep him safe.

It just kept him alone.

And this time—this time—he'd destroyed something that actually mattered.

Something real. Something good. Something worth fighting for.

And he'd done it on purpose.

---

Eben sat in the dark and realized something.

He'd spent his entire life building walls to keep people out.

Had convinced himself it was necessary. Smart. The only way to survive.

But the walls didn't just keep people out.

They kept him in.

Trapped.

Isolated.

Alone with his fear and his defenses and his carefully constructed distance.

And he'd never noticed.

Never realized that the thing he'd built to protect himself had become a prison.

Until now.

Until Noel.

Until he'd finally found someone worth letting in.

And then destroyed it because he didn't know how to do anything else.

---

His phone buzzed again.

Another text from Sam: *If you need to talk, I'm here.*

Eben stared at the message.

He should respond. Should reach out. Should admit he wasn't okay.

But he couldn't.

Because admitting he wasn't okay meant admitting he'd made a mistake.

Meant admitting he'd hurt Noel.

Meant admitting he didn't know how to fix it.

And Eben didn't know how to be that vulnerable.

Even now.

Even after everything.

So he put the phone away.

Started the car.

And drove home.

---

His apartment was dark. Cold. Empty.

Exactly how he'd left it.

Exactly how it had always been.

Eben stood in the doorway and thought: *This is what I chose.*

*This is what I protected.*

*This empty, lonely space where no one can hurt me.*

*Where I'm safe.*

*Where I'm alone.*

And for the first time in his life, he hated it.

---

He sat on the couch.

Didn't turn on the lights.

Just sat in the dark and replayed the day.

The morning. The hesitation. The gala. The photos.

Noel's face when the crowd cheered.

The way he'd looked to Eben for backup.

The way Eben had frozen.

The way Noel had smiled and lied and denied them because Eben hadn't given him any other choice.

And then the fight.

The confrontation.

The terrible, catastrophic words.

*This was never supposed to last.*

Noel's blank *okay.*

The sound of the door closing.

The silence that followed.

---

Eben sat in the dark and thought: *I just lost him.*

*I just lost the best thing that ever happened to me.*

*And I did it on purpose.*

The realization settled in his chest like lead.

He'd been so scared of losing Noel that he'd destroyed the relationship himself.

Had taken the fear of abandonment and turned it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Had proven—once again—that attachment destroys everything.

Except—

Except he was the one who'd done the destroying.

Not Noel.

Not the universe.

Not some inevitable tragedy.

Him.

He'd done this.

And he didn't know how to undo it.

---

The apartment was silent.

Dark.

Empty.

Eben sat alone and realized that he had spent his whole life building walls to keep people out.

He just hadn't expected to be the one trapped inside.

And now—

Now he was alone.

With his walls and his fear and his carefully constructed distance.

And no idea how to break free.

No idea if Noel would even want him to try.

No idea if it was already too late.

---

Tomorrow, they'd have to see each other.

Work together. Be professional. Get through the gala.

Pretend everything was fine.

Pretend they hadn't just destroyed each other.

The thought made him sick.

But what choice did he have?

He'd made his decision.

Had said the words.

Had pushed Noel away.

And Noel had let him.

It was done.

Over.

Exactly like he'd said it would be.

*This was never supposed to last.*

Except it was supposed to.

It was supposed to last forever.

And Eben had thrown it away.

Because he was too scared to hold on.

Because he was too broken to believe he deserved it.

Because he was too much of a coward to fight for what he wanted.

And now it was too late.

Now Noel was gone.

And Eben was alone.

In the dark.

With nothing but his walls and his regret and the devastating knowledge that he'd done this to himself.

That he'd destroyed the one thing that mattered.

On purpose.

Because he didn't know how to do anything else.

---

Eben sat in the dark.

And didn't cry.

He just sat there.

Alone.

The way he'd always been.

The way he'd always known he would be.

The only difference was—

This time, he knew exactly what he'd lost.

And exactly who was to blame.
