## Chapter 2: Gala Prep

**NOEL**

Merryweather Hall was chaos dressed up as organization.

Which was to say: it looked beautiful, everything was technically in place, and Mayor Kringle was approximately thirty seconds from a complete breakdown.

"The centerpieces are wrong," he said, gesturing wildly at a table that looked, to Noel's untrained eye, perfectly fine. "They're supposed to be *festive*, not *funeral*."

"They're poinsettias," Noel said.

"Exactly! Red and green! Like Christmas threw up on a table!"

"That's—that's literally the color scheme you approved."

"I've changed my mind!"

Wes appeared with coffee. "Mayor. Breathe."

Mayor Kringle took the coffee like a lifeline. "The sponsors are coming. Today. They're going to see this and think we're amateurs."

"We are amateurs," Hugh said cheerfully, adjusting a garland that absolutely did not need adjusting. "That's the charm!"

"That is not the charm!"

Noel exchanged a look with Eben, who was standing near the stage, quietly assessing the setup with the kind of calm focus that made Noel want to kiss him.

Or possibly hide behind him.

Both seemed reasonable.

---

Eben crossed to him. Handed him a clipboard. "Checklist."

"You made a checklist."

"I always make a checklist."

"I know. It's very you."

"Is that a compliment?"

"It's an observation."

"Sounds like a compliment."

"Don't let it go to your head."

Eben's mouth twitched. Almost a smile. But it didn't quite land.

Noel noticed. Again.

"You okay?" Noel asked quietly.

"Yeah. Just—" Eben gestured at the hall. "A lot to manage."

"We've managed worse."

"I know."

"The market literally collapsed. We rebuilt it in a day."

"I remember."

"So this should be easy."

"Should be."

But Eben's jaw was tight. His shoulders tense. And he was doing that thing where he looked at Noel without quite *seeing* him.

Like he was somewhere else. Somewhere Noel couldn't follow.

---

"Eben—"

"We should check the sound system." Eben was already moving away. "Make sure the mics are working."

And just like that, the conversation was over.

Noel stood there, holding the clipboard, watching Eben disappear into the crowd.

Something was wrong. He knew it was wrong.

But he didn't know how to fix it. And he was terrified that if he pushed, Eben would pull away completely.

So he did what he always did when he didn't know what else to do. He went into overdrive.

---

Noel threw himself into the gala prep with the kind of manic energy that came from not wanting to think too hard about anything.

He checked the centerpieces. Adjusted the lighting. Confirmed the catering schedule. Reorganized the seating chart. Helped Hugh untangle a string of lights that had somehow become sentient and malicious.

"You're doing it again," Eben said.

Noel looked up from the seating chart. "Doing what?"

"Pretending you're fine when you're breaking."

The words hit like a slap.

Noel's hands stilled on the paper. "I'm not breaking."

"Noel—"

"I'm fine. I'm just—busy. There's a lot to do."

"There's always a lot to do. That's not the point."

"Then what is the point?"

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Looked away.

"Eben. What's the point?"

"Nothing. Forget it."

"I'm not going to forget it. You just said I'm breaking. What does that mean?"

"It means—" Eben paused. Ran a hand through his hair. "It means you're compensating. You do this thing where you get really bright and busy when you're stressed. Like if you just keep moving, you won't have to feel anything."

Noel's chest tightened. "That's not—"

"It is. I've seen you do it. Every time something gets hard, you go into crisis mode. You fix things. You make yourself useful. You don't stop long enough to ask if you're okay."

"I'm okay."

"Are you?"

The question hung between them.

Noel wanted to say yes. Wanted to smile and deflect and change the subject.

But the truth was—he wasn't okay.

He was terrified. Terrified that Eben was pulling away. Terrified that the hesitation from this morning meant something. Terrified that he was about to lose the best thing that had ever happened to him.

But he couldn't say that. Because saying it out loud would make it real.

So instead, he said: "I'm fine. Just stressed about the gala."

Eben looked at him for a long moment. Something sad flickered in his eyes.

"Okay," he said quietly. "If you say so."

And he let it go. That was the problem. They both let it go.

---

The morning passed in a blur of last-minute adjustments and minor disasters.

The sound system had feedback issues. The caterer was late. Someone knocked over a centerpiece and Mayor Kringle nearly cried.

But they fixed it. All of it. Together.

Noel organized. Eben built. They moved around each other like they'd been doing this for years.

Like they were a team. Like they fit.

And for a few hours, Noel let himself believe that everything was fine.

That the hesitation from this morning didn't mean anything. That Eben's distance was just stress. That they were going to be okay.

---

By noon, the hall was ready.

Lights strung. Tables set. Stage prepared. Everything in place for the rehearsal.

The sponsors would arrive at two. The full rehearsal would start at three.

They had time.

Noel stood in the middle of the hall, surveying their work, and felt a flicker of pride.

"Looks good," Eben said, appearing at his side.

"Yeah. It does."

"You did good."

"We did good."

Eben's expression softened. "Yeah. We did."

For a moment, it felt like the morning again. Easy. Comfortable. Right.

Noel reached for Eben's hand. Their fingers brushed.

And then Mayor Kringle's voice cut through the hall: "They're here! The sponsors are here!"

Eben's hand pulled away.

Noel told himself it didn't mean anything. But his stomach dropped anyway.

---

The sponsors arrived in a flurry of expensive coats and professional smiles.

Mayor Kringle went into full charm mode, shaking hands and making introductions.

Noel stood off to the side, watching, trying not to look as nervous as he felt. Eben was beside him. Close but not touching.

"You ready for this?" Noel asked.

"Yeah. You?"

"As ready as I'll ever be."

"You'll be great."

"We'll be great."

Eben nodded. But he didn't smile.

And Noel's stomach tightened.

Because something was coming. He could feel it. The pressure building. The tension coiling. The sense that they were standing on the edge of something and one wrong move would send them tumbling.

Mayor Kringle was gesturing them over. Smiling. Excited.

"Come on," he called. "I want to show them what we've accomplished!"

Noel looked at Eben. Eben looked back.

And for just a second, Noel saw it. Fear. Raw and undeniable.

"Eben—"

"Let's go." Eben was already moving.

And Noel followed. Because what else could he do?

---

The sponsors were impressed. Complimentary. Enthusiastic about the festival's success.

Mayor Kringle beamed. "And it's all thanks to our incredible team. Especially Noel and Eben here. They've been the backbone of this entire operation."

The sponsors smiled. Nodded. Made polite noises of approval.

"We've been so pleased with the partnership," one of them said. "The photos from the earlier events were wonderful. Really captured the spirit of the festival."

Noel's stomach dropped. Photos.

"Oh!" Mayor Kringle lit up. "You know what? I have those! Let me pull them up. I was going to use them in the presentation anyway."

No. No no no.

"Mayor, I don't think—" Noel started.

But it was too late. Mayor Kringle was already pulling out his laptop. Already connecting it to the big screen. Already pulling up the photos.

And Noel could only watch as the screen flickered to life. As the photos appeared. As everything started to fall apart.
