## Chapter 1: Morning Bliss

**NOEL**

Everything was fine. Everything was perfect. Everything was about to go spectacularly, catastrophically wrong.

But Noel didn't know that yet.

He woke to sunlight streaming through his bedroom window, warm and golden and perfect. Eben was still asleep beside him, one arm draped across Noel's waist, breathing slow and even.

The ribbon was still on Noel's wrist. Bright red against his skin. A promise tied in silk.

Noel lay there, watching Eben sleep, and thought: *This is real.*

They'd said it. Out loud. *I love you.* Both of them. And they'd meant it.

And Eben had stayed.

Not just for the night. Not just because it was convenient. He'd stayed because he wanted to. Because he'd promised.

Because thisâ€”whatever this wasâ€”mattered.

Noel's chest felt too full. Like happiness was a physical thing taking up space in his ribs.

He'd never had this before. Never woken up next to someone and feltâ€”safe. Wanted. Like he belonged exactly where he was.

Like he didn't have to earn it.

---

Eben stirred. Opened his eyes. Saw Noel watching him.

"Morning," Eben said, voice rough with sleep.

"Morning."

"You're staring."

"You're in my bed. I'm allowed to stare."

Eben's mouth twitched. Almost a smile. "Fair."

They lay there in comfortable silence. Morning light. Warm sheets. The kind of quiet that felt like contentment instead of absence.

"Coffee?" Noel asked.

"Yeah."

Eben started to get up, but Noel caught his hand. "I'll make it. You stay."

"You sure?"

"Yeah. I know where everything is in my own kitchen." Noel grinned. "Unlike some people."

"I know where everything is in your kitchen."

"You do, actually." The realization settled warm in Noel's chest. "When did that happen?"

"I don't know." Eben's thumb brushed across Noel's knuckles. "Somewhere between the third disaster and the fifth coffee run."

"That's very specific."

"I'm a specific person."

"You're a ridiculous person."

"Also accurate."

Noel kissed him. Soft. Easy. The kind of kiss that said *good morning* and *I'm glad you're here* and *this is nice.*

When he pulled back, Eben was looking at him with an expression Noel couldn't quite read.

"What?" Noel asked.

"Nothing. Justâ€”" Eben paused. "This is nice."

There it was. That tiny hesitation. A fraction of a second too long before the words.

Noel noticed.

Didn't address it.

That was the first mistake.

---

Noel made coffee in his kitchen, humming under his breath, and told himself it was fine.

Eben was allowed to hesitate. Allowed to be uncertain. This was new for both of them. Big feelings. Big promises. The kind of vulnerability that made you want to run even when you wanted to stay.

Noel understood that.

He did.

So he ignored the tiny voice in the back of his head that whispered: *Something's wrong.*

He ignored the way Eben had gone very still when Noel said *this is nice.*

He ignored the fact that Eben's smile hadn't quite reached his eyes.

Hope was dangerous when it made you blind.

But Noel was choosing to be blind.

Because the alternativeâ€”acknowledging that something had shifted overnight, that the fear from last night's conversation hadn't disappeared, that Eben might be pulling away even as he stayedâ€”was too terrifying to face.

So Noel made coffee. Added cream to Eben's cup the way he liked it. Carried both mugs back to the bedroom.

And pretended everything was fine.

---

Eben was sitting up in bed, checking his phone. He looked up when Noel entered. Took the coffee mug with a quiet "Thanks."

Their fingers brushed. Lingered.

Noel sat on the edge of the bed. "Big day today."

"Gala rehearsal."

"Yeah. Final run-through before the actual event tomorrow." Noel sipped his coffee. "Mayor Kringle is probably already having a breakdown."

"Probably."

"We should get there early. Make sure everything's set up properly."

"Yeah."

Eben's responses were short. Clipped. Not cold, exactly, butâ€”distant. Like he was somewhere else even though he was sitting right there.

Noel's stomach tightened.

"You okay?" he asked.

"Yeah. Just thinking."

"About what?"

"The gala. Making sure we didn't miss anything."

It was a reasonable answer. A logical answer.

It was also a lie.

Noel could tell. Could see it in the way Eben wouldn't quite meet his eyes. In the way his shoulders were tense even though they were alone, safe, together.

"Ebenâ€”"

"We should get ready." Eben set down his coffee. Stood. "Don't want to be late."

And just like that, the moment was over.

Noel sat on the bed, holding his coffee, watching Eben move around the room like everything was normal.

Like nothing had changed.

Like that tiny hesitation didn't mean anything.

But it did.

Noel knew it did.

He just didn't know what to do about it.

---

They got ready in comfortable silence. Or what should have been comfortable silence.

Instead, it feltâ€”off. Like they were moving around each other carefully. Like they were both trying not to say something.

Eben pulled on his shirt. Noel watched him in the mirror.

"Three days left," Noel said quietly.

Eben's hands stilled on his buttons. "Until what?"

"Until Christmas. Until the twelve days are over."

"Right."

"What happens then?"

Eben turned. Looked at him. "What do you mean?"

"I meanâ€”" Noel gestured between them. "This. Us. Does itâ€”does it keep going? After the festival?"

"I told you it does."

"I know. I justâ€”" Noel paused. "I wanted to make sure."

"You don't believe me?"

"I do. I justâ€”" *I'm scared.* "I wanted to hear it again."

Eben crossed to him. Took his hands. "I'm staying. I meant what I said. I love you. This doesn't end when the festival ends."

The words were right. Perfect, even.

But something in Eben's eyes didn't match them.

Something that looked like fear.

Noel should have asked about it. Should have pushed. Should have said: *What are you afraid of?*

But he didn't.

Because he was afraid too.

Afraid that if he asked, Eben would tell him the truth.

And the truth might be something Noel couldn't fix.

So he smiled. Squeezed Eben's hands. Said, "Okay. Good."

And let it go.

That was the second mistake.

---

They left for Merryweather Hall together.

Walked through the cold morning air, breath fogging, shoulders brushing.

Noel's ribbon caught the light. Red and bright and impossible to miss.

A promise tied in silk.

A promise Eben had made.

A promise Noel desperately wanted to believe.

But as they walked, Noel couldn't shake the feeling that something was coming.

Something big. Something inevitable.

Something that would test everything they'd just promised each other.

The narrator would have told him to pay attention to that feeling.

Would have said: *When your gut screams danger, listen.*

But Noel was too busy being happy.

Too busy pretending everything was fine.

Too busy ignoring the warning signs.

And by the time he realized his mistake, it would be too late.




## Chapter 2: Gala Prep

**NOEL**

Merryweather Hall was chaos dressed up as organization.

Which was to say: it looked beautiful, everything was technically in place, and Mayor Kringle was approximately thirty seconds from a complete breakdown.

"The centerpieces are wrong," he said, gesturing wildly at a table that looked, to Noel's untrained eye, perfectly fine. "They're supposed to be *festive*, not *funeral*."

"They're poinsettias," Noel said.

"Exactly! Red and green! Like Christmas threw up on a table!"

"That'sâ€”that's literally the color scheme you approved."

"I've changed my mind!"

Wes appeared with coffee. "Mayor. Breathe."

Mayor Kringle took the coffee like a lifeline. "The sponsors are coming. Today. They're going to see this and think we're amateurs."

"We are amateurs," Hugh said cheerfully, adjusting a garland that absolutely did not need adjusting. "That's the charm!"

"That is not the charm!"

Noel exchanged a look with Eben, who was standing near the stage, quietly assessing the setup with the kind of calm focus that made Noel want to kiss him.

Or possibly hide behind him.

Both seemed reasonable.

---

Eben crossed to him. Handed him a clipboard. "Checklist."

"You made a checklist."

"I always make a checklist."

"I know. It's very you."

"Is that a compliment?"

"It's an observation."

"Sounds like a compliment."

"Don't let it go to your head."

Eben's mouth twitched. Almost a smile. But it didn't quite land.

Noel noticed. Again.

"You okay?" Noel asked quietly.

"Yeah. Justâ€”" Eben gestured at the hall. "A lot to manage."

"We've managed worse."

"I know."

"The market literally collapsed. We rebuilt it in a day."

"I remember."

"So this should be easy."

"Should be."

But Eben's jaw was tight. His shoulders tense. And he was doing that thing where he looked at Noel without quite *seeing* him.

Like he was somewhere else. Somewhere Noel couldn't follow.

---

"Ebenâ€”"

"We should check the sound system." Eben was already moving away. "Make sure the mics are working."

And just like that, the conversation was over.

Noel stood there, holding the clipboard, watching Eben disappear into the crowd.

Something was wrong. He knew it was wrong.

But he didn't know how to fix it. And he was terrified that if he pushed, Eben would pull away completely.

So he did what he always did when he didn't know what else to do. He went into overdrive.

---

Noel threw himself into the gala prep with the kind of manic energy that came from not wanting to think too hard about anything.

He checked the centerpieces. Adjusted the lighting. Confirmed the catering schedule. Reorganized the seating chart. Helped Hugh untangle a string of lights that had somehow become sentient and malicious.

"You're doing it again," Eben said.

Noel looked up from the seating chart. "Doing what?"

"Pretending you're fine when you're breaking."

The words hit like a slap.

Noel's hands stilled on the paper. "I'm not breaking."

"Noelâ€”"

"I'm fine. I'm justâ€”busy. There's a lot to do."

"There's always a lot to do. That's not the point."

"Then what is the point?"

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Looked away.

"Eben. What's the point?"

"Nothing. Forget it."

"I'm not going to forget it. You just said I'm breaking. What does that mean?"

"It meansâ€”" Eben paused. Ran a hand through his hair. "It means you're compensating. You do this thing where you get really bright and busy when you're stressed. Like if you just keep moving, you won't have to feel anything."

Noel's chest tightened. "That's notâ€”"

"It is. I've seen you do it. Every time something gets hard, you go into crisis mode. You fix things. You make yourself useful. You don't stop long enough to ask if you're okay."

"I'm okay."

"Are you?"

The question hung between them.

Noel wanted to say yes. Wanted to smile and deflect and change the subject.

But the truth wasâ€”he wasn't okay.

He was terrified. Terrified that Eben was pulling away. Terrified that the hesitation from this morning meant something. Terrified that he was about to lose the best thing that had ever happened to him.

But he couldn't say that. Because saying it out loud would make it real.

So instead, he said: "I'm fine. Just stressed about the gala."

Eben looked at him for a long moment. Something sad flickered in his eyes.

"Okay," he said quietly. "If you say so."

And he let it go. That was the problem. They both let it go.

---

The morning passed in a blur of last-minute adjustments and minor disasters.

The sound system had feedback issues. The caterer was late. Someone knocked over a centerpiece and Mayor Kringle nearly cried.

But they fixed it. All of it. Together.

Noel organized. Eben built. They moved around each other like they'd been doing this for years.

Like they were a team. Like they fit.

And for a few hours, Noel let himself believe that everything was fine.

That the hesitation from this morning didn't mean anything. That Eben's distance was just stress. That they were going to be okay.

---

By noon, the hall was ready.

Lights strung. Tables set. Stage prepared. Everything in place for the rehearsal.

The sponsors would arrive at two. The full rehearsal would start at three.

They had time.

Noel stood in the middle of the hall, surveying their work, and felt a flicker of pride.

"Looks good," Eben said, appearing at his side.

"Yeah. It does."

"You did good."

"We did good."

Eben's expression softened. "Yeah. We did."

For a moment, it felt like the morning again. Easy. Comfortable. Right.

Noel reached for Eben's hand. Their fingers brushed.

And then Mayor Kringle's voice cut through the hall: "They're here! The sponsors are here!"

Eben's hand pulled away.

Noel told himself it didn't mean anything. But his stomach dropped anyway.

---

The sponsors arrived in a flurry of expensive coats and professional smiles.

Mayor Kringle went into full charm mode, shaking hands and making introductions.

Noel stood off to the side, watching, trying not to look as nervous as he felt. Eben was beside him. Close but not touching.

"You ready for this?" Noel asked.

"Yeah. You?"

"As ready as I'll ever be."

"You'll be great."

"We'll be great."

Eben nodded. But he didn't smile.

And Noel's stomach tightened.

Because something was coming. He could feel it. The pressure building. The tension coiling. The sense that they were standing on the edge of something and one wrong move would send them tumbling.

Mayor Kringle was gesturing them over. Smiling. Excited.

"Come on," he called. "I want to show them what we've accomplished!"

Noel looked at Eben. Eben looked back.

And for just a second, Noel saw it. Fear. Raw and undeniable.

"Ebenâ€”"

"Let's go." Eben was already moving.

And Noel followed. Because what else could he do?

---

The sponsors were impressed. Complimentary. Enthusiastic about the festival's success.

Mayor Kringle beamed. "And it's all thanks to our incredible team. Especially Noel and Eben here. They've been the backbone of this entire operation."

The sponsors smiled. Nodded. Made polite noises of approval.

"We've been so pleased with the partnership," one of them said. "The photos from the earlier events were wonderful. Really captured the spirit of the festival."

Noel's stomach dropped. Photos.

"Oh!" Mayor Kringle lit up. "You know what? I have those! Let me pull them up. I was going to use them in the presentation anyway."

No. No no no.

"Mayor, I don't thinkâ€”" Noel started.

But it was too late. Mayor Kringle was already pulling out his laptop. Already connecting it to the big screen. Already pulling up the photos.

And Noel could only watch as the screen flickered to life. As the photos appeared. As everything started to fall apart.




## Chapter 3: The Photo Reveal

**NOEL**

The first photo was fine.

Professional. Clean. Noel and Eben standing in front of the festival banner, looking competent and organized.

The second photo was fine too.

Them at the market. Smiling. Surrounded by vendors and holiday cheer.

The third photoâ€”

The third photo was not fine.

It was the one from the sponsor event. The one where they'd been talking, and someone had caught them mid-conversation. The one where Eben was looking at Noel like he was the only person in the room.

The one where Noel was looking back the same way.

The one that said everything.

The screen was huge. The photo was unavoidable. And the entire room could see it.

Noel's heart stopped.

---

The crowd's reaction was immediate.

Whispers. Knowing smiles. A few delighted gasps.

"Oh my god, finally!" someone said.

"I knew it!"

"They're so cute together!"

Mayor Kringle, oblivious, beamed at the screen. "Aren't they wonderful? Such a great partnership!"

Partnership. Right. That's what this was.

Except the photo on the screen said otherwise. And everyone in the room knew it.

---

Noel stood frozen.

His brain had stopped working. His body had stopped working. Everything had justâ€”stopped.

This wasn't supposed to happen.

They weren't supposed to be *public* yet. They hadn't talked about it. Hadn't decided how to handle it. Hadn't agreed on what to say or when to say it.

And now the entire town was looking at them. Waiting. Expecting.

Noel's throat closed. He looked at Eben.

Eben was staring at the screen like it was a firing squad. His face was blank. Carefully, deliberately blank.

The kind of blank that meant he was panicking.

*Say something,* Noel thought desperately. *Please. Justâ€”say something.*

But Eben didn't move. Didn't speak. Didn't do anything.

He just stood there, frozen, while the entire room watched them.

---

"So?" someone called out. "When's the official announcement?"

The question hung in the air. Noel's pulse hammered in his ears.

He looked at Eben again. *Please.*

But Eben's jaw was locked. His shoulders rigid. His entire body screaming *run* even though his feet hadn't moved.

And Noel realizedâ€”with a sick, sinking certaintyâ€”that Eben wasn't going to say anything.

He was going to stand there and let Noel handle it. He was going to leave Noel alone in the spotlight. Again.

---

Noel's smile felt like it was cracking his face in half.

"Just teamwork," he heard himself say. His voice sounded wrong. Too bright. Too forced. "Nothing to announce."

The room went quiet.

Someone laughed awkwardly. "Come on. You can't tell me that photo is *just teamwork*."

"I meanâ€”" Noel gestured vaguely at the screen. "We work well together. That's all."

"That's not what it looks like."

"Well. Looks can be deceiving."

The words tasted like ash. Because he was lying.

He was standing in front of the entire town, looking at a photo that showed exactly how he felt about Eben, and he was lying. Denying it. Denying *them*.

Because Eben wouldn't confirm it.

---

Mayor Kringle, finally sensing the tension, cleared his throat. "Well! Regardless ofâ€”umâ€”personal dynamics, we're very grateful for their hard work!"

He clicked to the next slide. The moment passed.

People turned their attention back to the presentation. But Noel could feel their eyes on him. Could hear the whispers. Could feel the weight of what he'd just done.

He'd publicly denied them. In front of everyone. Because Eben had given him no choice.

---

Noel's hands were shaking.

He shoved them in his pockets. Kept his smile fixed. Pretended everything was fine.

But inside, he was breaking.

Because Eben had frozen. When it matteredâ€”when Noel needed him to step up, to say *something*, to acknowledge what they wereâ€”Eben had frozen.

And Noel had been left to clean up the mess alone. Just like always.

---

The presentation continued.

Noel stood there, nodding at appropriate moments, making polite conversation, doing his job. But he wasn't really there.

He was somewhere else. Somewhere dark and familiar. The place where his wound lived.

*You weren't enough. You're never enough.*

*You were useful for a while. That's all you ever are.*

The voice was quiet. Insidious. True.

Because if Noel was enoughâ€”if he matteredâ€”Eben would have said something. Would have claimed him. Would have stood beside him instead of leaving him to face the crowd alone.

But he hadn't. And Noel knew what that meant.

---

The presentation ended.

The sponsors applauded. Mayor Kringle looked relieved. The crowd dispersed, chattering about the gala and the festival and probablyâ€”definitelyâ€”about the photo.

Noel stood in the middle of it all, smiling, nodding, pretending.

Eben was across the room. Talking to someone. Looking calm and collected and completely unaffected. Like nothing had happened. Like he hadn't just destroyed Noel in front of everyone.

Noel's chest felt too tight. He needed air. He needed space.

He neededâ€”

"Noel."

Eben's voice. Quiet. Careful.

Noel turned. Eben was standing there, hands in his pockets, expression unreadable.

"We need to talk," Eben said.

"Yeah," Noel said. His voice sounded flat. Distant. "We do."

---

They found a private room.

One of the small offices off the main hall. Empty. Quiet.

The door closed behind them with a soft click. And suddenly, the silence was deafening.

Noel stood with his back to the door. Eben stood near the window. Neither of them spoke.

The air between them felt like glass. Fragile. Ready to shatter.

"Why didn't you say something?" Noel asked finally.

His voice was quiet. Controlled. He was proud of that. Proud that he didn't sound like he was breaking. Even though he was.

"What was I supposed to say?" Eben's voice was just as quiet. Just as controlled.

"Anything. You could have said anything."

"Noelâ€”"

"You just stood there. You didn't move. You didn't speak. You justâ€”" Noel's hands clenched. "You left me alone."

"I didn't know what to say."

"You could have said yes. You could have said we're together. You could haveâ€”" Noel's voice cracked. "You could have not made me lie."

Eben flinched. Good. He should flinch.

"I didn't meanâ€”"

"Didn't mean what? To make me deny us in front of the entire town? To stand there and watch me do it?"

"I panicked."

"I know you panicked! I could see you panicking! But you still didn't say anything!"

"I'm sorry."

"Are you?"

The question hung between them.

Eben's jaw tightened. "Yes. I'm sorry. I should haveâ€”I don't know. I should have done something."

"But you didn't."

"No. I didn't."

Noel laughed. It sounded bitter. "Right. Of course."

"Noelâ€”"

"This isn'tâ€”" Noel stopped. Shook his head. "This isn't what I thought it was."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean this. Us. I thoughtâ€”" His throat closed. "I thought it was real."

And there it was. The question he'd been afraid to ask. The fear he'd been trying to ignore.

Eben's face went pale. "It is real."

"Is it? Because it doesn't feel real right now. It feels likeâ€”" Noel's voice broke. "It feels like I'm the only one who wants this."

"That's not true."

"Then why didn't you say something?"

"I told you. I panicked."

"That's not good enough!"

"I know it's not good enough! I know I messed up! But I'm tryingâ€”"

"Trying what? To what, Eben?"

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it.

And Noel saw it. The exact moment Eben's walls slammed up. The exact moment he retreated. The exact moment Noel lost him.

"This was never supposed toâ€”"

Eben stopped. But the damage was done.

Noel went very still. "Finish the sentence."

"Noelâ€”"

"Finish. The sentence."

Silence.

Noel's heart was pounding so hard it hurt.

"Was this ever real to you?" he asked quietly.

And waited for Eben to say yes. Waited for Eben to explain. Waited for Eben to fix this.

But Eben just stood there. Silent. Trapped.

And Noel knewâ€”with absolute, devastating certaintyâ€”what was coming next.




## Chapter 4: The Snap

**EBEN**

Eben's entire body felt like it was shutting down.

Fight or flight. Except he couldn't do either.

He was justâ€”frozen. Standing in this small room with Noel looking at him like he'd just been stabbed, and Eben couldn't move. Couldn't speak. Couldn't do anything except stand there and watch everything fall apart.

*Say something,* his brain screamed. *Say anything.*

But his mouth wouldn't cooperate. Because the truth was too big. Too terrifying. Too real.

And the lieâ€”the old pattern, the survival instinctâ€”was right there. Ready. Familiar.

*Destroy it before it destroys you.*

---

"Eben." Noel's voice was quiet. Controlled. "Was this ever real to you?"

The question hit like a physical blow.

*Yes,* Eben wanted to say. *Yes, it's real. It's the most real thing I've ever had.*

But the words wouldn't come. Because saying them out loud meant admitting how much he needed this. How much he needed Noel. How completely and utterly terrified he was of losing it.

And Eben had spent his entire life not needing anyone. Not depending on anyone. Not letting anyone close enough to hurt him.

And now here he was. Completely exposed. Completely vulnerable.

And his entire body was screaming at him to run.

---

"I don'tâ€”" Eben started. Stopped. Tried again. "This isn'tâ€”"

The words tangled in his throat. Noel's expression shifted. Something hard and hurt flickering in his eyes.

"This isn't what?" Noel asked. His voice was very quiet. Very careful. "Real?"

*No. That's not what I meant.*

But Eben couldn't say it. Couldn't explain. Couldn't make his brain and his mouth work together long enough to say what he actually meant.

Which was: *This is too real. This is too much. I don't know how to do this.*

But all that came out was: "I don't know."

And Noel flinched like he'd been hit.

---

"You don't know," Noel repeated.

"I didn't meanâ€”"

"You don't know if this is real."

"That's not what I said."

"It's what you meant."

"No. I justâ€”" Eben ran a hand through his hair. "I panicked. Out there. I didn't know what to say."

"So you said nothing."

"Yes."

"And left me to handle it alone."

"I'm sorry."

"Are you?"

The question was sharp. Pointed.

Eben met Noel's eyes. "Yes. I'm sorry. I should have said something. I should haveâ€”"

"Should have what? Claimed me? Acknowledged us? Acted like you actually want this?"

"I do want this."

"Do you? Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're trying to find the exit."

The words landed like a punch. Because they were true.

Eben *was* looking for the exit. Had been looking for it since the moment he woke up this morning. Since the moment he realized how happy he was. How much he wanted this to last.

Because happiness was dangerous. Happiness made you soft. Happiness gave you something to lose.

And Eben had spent his entire life making sure he had nothing to lose.

---

"I'm notâ€”" Eben started.

"You are." Noel's voice cracked. "You're pulling away. I can feel it. You've been pulling away all day."

"I haven'tâ€”"

"You have! This morning. The hesitation. The distance. The way you won't look at me. The way youâ€”" Noel's hands clenched. "You're running. You're just doing it while standing still."

Eben's chest tightened. Because Noel was right.

He was running. Had been running since the moment he realized he was in love. Since the moment he realized he wanted to stay. Since the moment he realized that staying meant risking everything.

"I'm scared," Eben said quietly.

The admission felt like ripping open a wound. Noel went very still. "Of what?"

"This. Us. How much Iâ€”" Eben stopped. Swallowed. "How much I want this to work."

"Then why are you pulling away?"

"Because I don't know how to do this!" The words came out louder than he meant. Sharper. "I don't know how toâ€”to be this vulnerable. To need someone this much. Toâ€”"

He stopped. Took a breath. Tried to find the words.

"I've spent my entire life not needing anyone," he said finally. "Not depending on anyone. Not letting anyone close enough to hurt me. And now you'reâ€”you're *here*. And Iâ€”"

His voice broke. "I don't know how to do this without destroying it."

---

The silence that followed was deafening. Noel stared at him. Expression unreadable.

"So that's it?" Noel said finally. "You're scared, so you're just going toâ€”what? Walk away?"

"I'm not walking away."

"You're not staying either."

"I am staying. I told you I'm staying."

"You told me a lot of things." Noel's voice was flat. "You told me you loved me. You told me you wanted this. You told me it was real. And then the first time it got hardâ€”the first time you had to actually *show* itâ€”you froze."

"I know. I know I messed up. But I'm tryingâ€”"

"Trying what? To figure out how to leave without it being your fault?"

The accusation hit like a blade.

"That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Noel's eyes were bright. Angry. Hurt. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're doing exactly what you always do. You're finding a reason to run before I can leave you first."

Eben's breath caught. Because that wasâ€”that was exactly what he was doing. And Noel knew it.

---

"I'm notâ€”" Eben started.

But he couldn't finish. Because it was true. All of it.

He was scared. He was running. He was looking for the exit. Because that's what he did. That's what he'd always done.

Destroy it before it destroys you. It was the only way he knew how to survive.

"This was never supposed toâ€”"

The words slipped out before he could stop them. Eben froze. Noel went very, very still.

"Finish the sentence," Noel said quietly.

"Noelâ€”"

"Finish it."

Eben's throat closed. He should stop. Should backtrack. Should explain what he actually meant.

But his walls were up. His defenses activated. And the old pattern was running the show. And the old pattern said: *End it now. Before it ends you.*

So he did.




## Chapter 5: The Wound Strike

**EBEN**

"This was never supposed to last."

The words hung in the air like smoke.

Eben heard himself say them. Felt them leave his mouth. Watched them land on Noel like a physical blow.

And he wantedâ€”desperately, viscerallyâ€”to take them back. But it was too late. The damage was done.

---

Noel's face went blank. Not angry. Not hurt. Justâ€”blank.

Empty. Like someone had reached inside him and turned off all the lights.

And that was worse. So much worse than anger. So much worse than tears.

Because blank meant Noel had expected this. Blank meant Noel had been waiting for this. Blank meant Noel's wound had just been proven right.

*You're not enough. You're never enough.*

And Eben had just confirmed it.

---

"Okay," Noel said.

His voice was quiet. Flat. Completely devoid of emotion. And that single wordâ€”that simple, devastating *okay*â€”hit Eben like a freight train.

"Noelâ€”"

"No. It's okay. I get it."

"You don'tâ€”"

"I do." Noel's smile was small. Sad. "You were clear from the beginning. Temporary. Just until the festival ended. I justâ€”" He laughed. It sounded broken. "I just forgot."

"That's not what I meant."

"Isn't it?"

"No. I meantâ€”" Eben stopped. Because what *had* he meant? "I meant this was never supposed to get this serious. This intense. I wasn't supposed toâ€”"

He couldn't finish.

Couldn't say *I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you.*

Couldn't say *I wasn't supposed to need you this much.*

Couldn't say *I wasn't supposed to be this terrified of losing you.*

Because saying any of that would mean admitting how completely he'd failed at keeping his distance. How completely he'd let Noel in. How completely he was about to destroy the best thing that had ever happened to him.

---

"After the festival," Eben heard himself say. "That was always the plan."

*Stop talking,* his brain screamed. *Stop. You're making it worse.*

But he couldn't stop. The words kept coming. Automatic. Defensive. The old script running on autopilot.

"We said temporary. We agreed."

"We did," Noel said quietly. "You're right."

"So thisâ€”what happened out thereâ€”it doesn't change anything."

"No. I guess it doesn't."

Noel's voice was so calm. So accepting. And Eben wanted to scream. Wanted to grab Noel and shake him and say: *Fight me. Yell at me. Tell me I'm wrong.*

But Noel just stood there. Blank. Accepting. Like he'd known this was coming all along.

---

"I should go," Noel said.

"What?"

"I should go. You're right. This wasâ€”it was temporary. And Iâ€”" His voice cracked. Just slightly. "I let myself forget that. But I won't make that mistake again."

"Noel, waitâ€”"

"No. It's fine. Really." Noel moved toward the door. "We still have the gala tomorrow. We can be professional. Get through it. And thenâ€”"

He stopped. Took a breath.

"And then it's done. Like we agreed."

The words felt like a death sentence.

"That's not what I want," Eben said.

The admission slipped out. Raw. Honest. Noel paused. Hand on the doorknob.

"Then what do you want?" he asked quietly.

And Ebenâ€”Eben didn't know how to answer.

Because what he wanted was impossible. He wanted Noel. Wanted this. Wanted to stay.

But he also wanted to not be terrified. Wanted to not be vulnerable. Wanted to not risk losing everything. And he couldn't have both.

So he said nothing. And Noel's shoulders sagged.

"That's what I thought," Noel said.

And he left.

---

The door closed with a soft click.

And Eben stood alone in the empty room, staring at the space where Noel had been.

*What did I just do?*

He'd said the worst possible thing. Had taken every fear, every wound, every defense mechanism he had and weaponized them against the person he loved most.

Had destroyed the best thing in his life because he was too scared to keep it.

And Noel had justâ€”accepted it. Hadn't fought. Hadn't argued. Hadn't tried to change his mind. Had just said *okay* and walked away.

Like he'd been expecting it. Like he'd known, all along, that Eben would do this. That Eben would run. That Eben would choose fear over love.

---

Eben sank into a chair. Put his head in his hands. And tried to breathe.

*This was never supposed to last.*

He'd said it. Out loud. To Noel's face. Had taken the lie they'd both been telling themselves and made it real.

Except it *was* a lie. Because Eben wanted it to last. Wanted Noel to stay. Wanted thisâ€”whatever this wasâ€”to be permanent.

But he'd been too scared to say it. Too scared to fight for it. Too scared to be vulnerable enough to admit how much he needed it.

So instead, he'd destroyed it. Preemptively. Before it could destroy him.

---

The pattern was so familiar it hurt.

This was what he did. This was what he'd always done.

Someone got too close, and he pushed them away. Someone made him feel too much, and he shut down. Someone made him want to stay, and he found a reason to leave.

It was survival. It was protection. It was the only way he knew how to keep himself safe.

Exceptâ€”except Noel's face. That blank, accepting *okay.* The sound of someone who'd expected this all along. The sound of someone whose worst fear had just been confirmed.

*You're not enough. You're never enough.*

And Eben had just proven it.

---

He sat there for a long time. Alone in the empty room. Replaying the conversation. Replaying Noel's face. Replaying the moment everything broke.

And he thought: *I just lost him.*

*I just lost the best thing that ever happened to me. And I did it on purpose.*

The realization settled in his chest like lead. Heavy. Suffocating. Undeniable.

He'd been so scared of losing Noel that he'd destroyed the relationship himself. Had taken the fear of abandonment and turned it into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Had proven, once again, that attachment destroys everything.

Exceptâ€”except he was the one who'd done the destroying. Not Noel. Not the universe. Not fate or circumstance or bad timing.

Him. He'd done this.

And he didn't know how to fix it. Didn't know if he *could* fix it. Didn't know if Noel would even want him to try.

---

Eben stood. Walked to the window. Looked out at Merryweather Hall, still decorated and beautiful and full of people preparing for tomorrow's gala.

Tomorrow. They'd have to see each other tomorrow. Have to work together. Be professional. Pretend everything was fine.

Pretend they hadn't just destroyed each other.

The thought made him sick. But what choice did he have?

He'd made his decision. Had said the words. Had pushed Noel away. And Noel had let him.

It was done. Over. Exactly like he'd said it would be.

*This was never supposed to last.*

Except it was supposed to. It was supposed to last forever. And Eben had just thrown it away.

Because he was too scared to hold on. Because he was too broken to believe he deserved it. Because he was too much of a coward to fight for what he wanted.

And now it was too late. Now Noel was gone.

And Eben was alone. Again. Just like he'd always been. Just like he'd always known he would be.

The only difference wasâ€”this time, he had no one to blame but himself.




## Chapter 6: The Cold

**NOEL**

Noel walked.

He didn't know where he was going. Didn't care.

He just needed to move. Needed to get away. Needed to not be in that room with Eben's words still hanging in the air.

*This was never supposed to last.*

The hallway was empty. Everyone was still in the main hall, preparing for tomorrow's gala.

Tomorrow. He'd have to see Eben tomorrow. Have to work beside him. Smile. Pretend everything was fine.

Pretend his heart wasn't shattered into a thousand pieces.

The thought made him want to laugh. Or cry. He wasn't sure which.

---

Noel found himself back in the main hall.

Empty now. The sponsors had left. The crowd had dispersed. Just the space, decorated and beautiful and completely silent.

The lights were still on. Twinkling. Festive. It felt like a mockery.

Noel stood in the center of the hall, surrounded by Christmas cheer, and feltâ€”nothing. Numb. Empty.

Like someone had reached inside him and scooped out everything that mattered.

---

*Of course.*

The thought was quiet. Familiar. True.

*Of course this was temporary. He said so from the beginning. I just didn't believe him.*

Noel's wound whispered through him, insidious and certain.

*You weren't enough. You're never enough. You were useful for a while. That's all you ever are.*

And the worst partâ€”the absolutely devastating partâ€”was that it felt true.

Because if Noel had been enough, Eben would have said something. Would have claimed him in front of the town. Would have fought for them instead of freezing. Would have chosen him instead of choosing fear.

But he hadn't. And Noel knew what that meant.

---

He looked down at his wrist.

The ribbon was still there. Bright red against his skin. A promise tied in silk.

Except it wasn't a promise. It was a lie.

Noel's fingers moved to untie it. Stopped.

He couldn't. Not yet. Not when it still felt like the only proof that any of it had been real. That Eben had loved him, even if only for a moment. That he'd mattered, even if only temporarily.

So he left it. Left the ribbon on his wrist like a scar. A reminder. A warning.

*Don't forget this time. Don't let yourself believe.*

---

Noel's phone buzzed.

He pulled it out. A text from Hugh. *You okay? Saw you leave.*

Noel stared at the message. *You okay?*

No. He wasn't okay. He was breaking.

But he couldn't say that. Couldn't admit it. Couldn't let anyone see how completely he'd fallen apart.

So he typed back: *I'm fine. Just needed air.*

The lie came easily. It always did.

*I'm fine* was Noel's default. His armor. His way of keeping people at a distance. Even when he was drowning. Even when he was breaking. Even when he desperately needed someone to see through the lie and help him.

He sent the text. Put his phone away. And stood alone in the empty hall.

---

The silence was deafening.

No music. No voices. No laughter. Just Noel and the twinkling lights and the weight of everything he'd just lost.

He should leave. Should go home. Get some sleep. Prepare for tomorrow.

But he couldn't move. Couldn't make his feet work. Couldn't do anything except stand there and replay the conversation over and over.

*This was never supposed to last.*

*After the festival. That was always the plan.*

Eben's voice. Calm. Certain. Devastating.

And Noel's response: *Okay.*

That blank, accepting *okay* that meant his wound had won. That meant he'd given up. That meant he'd let Eben go without a fight.

---

He should have fought.

Should have yelled. Should have demanded answers. Should have made Eben explain what he actually meant instead of just accepting the worst possible interpretation.

But he hadn't. Because deep down, Noel had been expecting this. Had been waiting for it. Had knownâ€”absolutely knownâ€”that this was how it would end.

Because good things didn't last. Not for him. Not when he was justâ€”useful. Temporary. Convenient. Not when he wasn't enough.

---

Noel's chest felt too tight. His eyes burned.

But he didn't cry. He just stood there. Numb. Empty. Alone.

The way he'd always been. The way he'd always known he would be.

Because that was the truth, wasn't it? He could be charming. Helpful. Indispensable. But he couldn't be loved. Not really. Not in a way that lasted. Not in a way that mattered.

Eben had proven that. Had looked at everything they'd builtâ€”all the mornings and the laughter and the vulnerability and the promisesâ€”and decided it wasn't enough. Decided *Noel* wasn't enough.

And Noel had justâ€”accepted it. Because what else could he do?

---

The hall lights flickered. Someone must be turning things off for the night.

Noel should go. Should leave before someone found him standing here like a ghost.

But he couldn't move. Couldn't make himself walk away from this space where, just hours ago, everything had been fine.

Where he'd been happy. Where he'd believedâ€”stupidly, naivelyâ€”that he'd finally found something real. Someone who saw him. Wanted him. Chose him.

But it had all been temporary. Just like Eben said. Just like Noel should have known.

---

His phone buzzed again. Another text from Hugh: *If you need anything, I'm here.*

Noel stared at the message. *I'm here.*

The words should comfort him. Should remind him that he wasn't alone. That he had friends. That he mattered to people.

But all he could think was: *Eben's not here.*

*Eben left. Eben chose fear over me.* And that was the only thing that mattered.

---

Noel typed back: *Thanks. I'm okay.*

Another lie. But what else could he say?

*I'm breaking. I'm not okay. I don't know how to be okay.*

*The person I love just destroyed me and I let him.*

*I'm standing in an empty hall trying to figure out how to breathe.*

No. He couldn't say any of that. So he said: *I'm okay.*

And hoped that if he said it enough times, it might become true.

---

The lights went out. One section at a time. The hall growing darker. Quieter. Emptier.

Noel stood in the dimming light and thought: *This is what the end looks like.*

Not dramatic. Not explosive. Justâ€”quiet. Just standing alone in the dark, watching the lights go out one by one. Just accepting that the thing you wanted most is gone. And there's nothing you can do to get it back.

---

Noel finally moved. Walked toward the exit. Each step felt heavy. Deliberate. Wrong. Like he was walking away from something important.

But there was nothing left to stay for. Eben had made that clear.

*This was never supposed to last.*

So Noel left. Walked out into the cold December night. Alone. The way he'd started. The way he'd always known he'd end up.

The ribbon was still on his wrist. He didn't take it off. Not yet. Not when it was the only thing keeping him tethered to the memory of what it felt like to be loved.

Even if only for a moment. Even if only temporarily. Even if it had all been a lie.

He walked home through the dark streets. And didn't cry. He just went numb. And told himself he was fine.

Over and over. Until the words lost all meaning. Until he almost believed them.

Almost.




## Chapter 7: Hook Ending

**EBEN**

Eben drove.

He didn't remember getting in his car. Didn't remember leaving Merryweather Hall. He just found himself on the dark roads outside town, headlights cutting through the December night, with no idea where he was going.

Anywhere. Nowhere. Away.

---

The roads were empty.

Everyone was home. Warm. Safe. Preparing for Christmas. Everyone except Eben, who was driving through the dark, replaying the worst conversation of his life.

*This was never supposed to last.*

He'd said it. Out loud. To Noel's face. And he hadn't meant it. Not the way it sounded. Not the way Noel had heard it.

What he'd meant was: *This wasn't supposed to get this serious. I wasn't supposed to fall this hard.*

But that's not what he'd said. And now Noel thought it had all been a lie. Thought Eben had been planning to leave all along.

Thought he didn't matter.

And Eben had let him think it. Had watched Noel's face go blank and hadn't corrected him. Hadn't fought. Hadn't explained. He had just let him go.

---

Eben pulled over.

Parked on the side of the road, engine still running. He sat there, hands on the wheel, and tried to breathe.

*What did I just do?*

He'd panicked. That's what happened. The photos appeared. The crowd cheered. And Eben's entire body had gone into fight-or-flight mode.

Except he couldn't fight. And he couldn't flee. So he'd justâ€”frozen.

He had stood there like a coward while Noel handled it alone. While Noel smiled and deflected and denied them in front of everyone because Eben hadn't given him any other choice.

---

And then the confrontation. The private room. The questions. The fear.

*Was this ever real to you?*

Yes. God, yes. It was the most real thing Eben had ever had. But he couldn't say it. Because saying it meant admitting how much he needed itâ€”how completely and utterly terrified he was of losing it.

Eben didn't know how to be that vulnerable. He didn't know how to trust that it wouldn't destroy him.

So instead, he'd destroyed it himself.

---

*This was never supposed to last.*

The words echoed in his head. A lie he'd told to protect himself, now a weapon that had cost him everything.

Because Noel had believed him. Had taken those words at face value and walked away in that flat, devastated voice.

---

He should go back. Should find Noel. Explain. Apologize. Tell him the truth: *I love you. I want this. I'm just terrified.*

But what if Noel didn't believe him? What if the damage was already done?

What if Eben had finally pushed too hard, run too far, destroyed the one thing he couldn't afford to lose?

The thought made him sick.

---

Eben turned off the engine. Sat in the dark. And faced the truth.

He'd spent his entire life building defenses to keep people out. He'd perfected the art of not needing anyone, convinced that attachment was dangerous and vulnerability was weakness.

And it had worked. For years, he'd been safe. Protected. Invulnerable.

And completely, utterly alone.

Until Noel.

---

Noel, who'd slipped past every defense Eben had. Who'd made him laugh. Made him care. Made him want to stay.

Noel had looked at all of Eben's sharp edges and said: *I see you. And I'm not going anywhere.* He'd been patient, willing to wait while Eben figured out how to let him in. He'd trusted Eben with his own wounds.

He'd said *I love you* first. He'd tied a ribbon on Eben's wrist and asked him to stay.

And Eben had said yes. Had wantedâ€”desperatelyâ€”to be the kind of person who could keep that promise.

But when it mattered, he'd frozen. He'd chosen fear. And now Noel was gone.

---

Eben's phone buzzed. A text from Sam: *Heard what happened. You okay?*

Eben stared at the message. Was he okay?

No. He'd just destroyed the best thing in his life because he was too scared to keep it. But he couldn't say that. So he didn't respond. He just put the phone away and sat in the dark.

---

The pattern was so clear now.

Destroy it before it destroys you. That's what he'd always done. Someone got too close, and he pushed them away. Someone made him feel too much, and he shut down. Someone made him want to stay, and he found a reason to leave.

It was the only way he knew how to keep himself safe. Except it didn't keep him safe. It just kept him alone.

And this time, he'd destroyed something that actually mattered. Something real. Something worth fighting for.

And he'd done it on purpose.

---

Eben started the car and drove home.

His apartment was dark, cold, and empty. Exactly how it had always been.

He stood in the doorway and thought: *This is what I protected. This empty, lonely space where no one can hurt me.*

*Where I'm safe. Where I'm alone.*

And for the first time in his life, he hated it.

---

He sat on the couch in the dark and replayed the day. The morning hesitation. The gala. The photos.

Noel's face when the crowd cheered. The way he'd looked to Eben for backup. The way Eben had frozen.

And then the fight. The terrible, catastrophic words.

*This was never supposed to last.*

Noel's blank *okay.* The sound of the door closing. The silence that followed.

---

*I just lost him.*

The realization settled in his chest like lead. He'd been so scared of losing Noel that he'd triggered the abandonment himself. He'd taken the fear and turned it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

He'd provenâ€”once againâ€”that attachment destroys everything. Except he was the one who'd done the destroying. Not the universe.

Him. He'd done this. And he didn't know how to undo it.

---

Eben sat alone and realized that he had spent his whole life building walls to keep people out. He just hadn't expected to be the one trapped inside.

And now he was alone with his fear and his carefully constructed distance, and no idea how to break free. No idea if Noel would even want him to try.

---

Tomorrow, they'd have to see each other. Work together. Be professional. Get through the gala.

Pretend everything was fine. Pretend they hadn't just destroyed each other.

The thought made him sick. But what choice did he have? He'd made his decision. Had pushed Noel away. And Noel had let him.

It was done. Over. Exactly like he'd said it would be.

*This was never supposed to last.*

Except it was supposed to. It was supposed to last forever. And Eben had thrown it away because he was too scared to hold on. Because he was too broken to believe he deserved it.

And now Noel was gone. And Eben was alone in the dark, with nothing but his regret and the devastating knowledge that he'd done this to himself.

He'd destroyed the one thing that mattered. On purpose.

Because he didn't know how to do anything else.

---

Eben sat in the dark. And didn't cry.

He just sat there. Alone. The way he'd always been.

The only difference was, this time he knew exactly what he'd lost.

And exactly who was to blame.
