## Chapter 1: Morning Bliss

**NOEL**

Everything was fine. Everything was perfect. Everything was about to go spectacularly, catastrophically wrong.

But Noel didn't know that yet.

He woke to sunlight streaming through his bedroom window, warm and golden and perfect. Eben was still asleep beside him, one arm draped across Noel's waist, breathing slow and even.

The ribbon was still on Noel's wrist. Bright red against his skin. A promise tied in silk.

Noel lay there, watching Eben sleep, and thought: *This is real.*

They'd said it. Out loud. *I love you.* Both of them. And they'd meant it.

And Eben had stayed.

Not just for the night. Not just because it was convenient. He'd stayed because he wanted to. Because he'd promised.

Because this—whatever this was—mattered.

Noel's chest felt too full. Like happiness was a physical thing taking up space in his ribs.

He'd never had this before. Never woken up next to someone and felt—safe. Wanted. Like he belonged exactly where he was.

Like he didn't have to earn it.

---

Eben stirred. Opened his eyes. Saw Noel watching him.

"Morning," Eben said, voice rough with sleep.

"Morning."

"You're staring."

"You're in my bed. I'm allowed to stare."

Eben's mouth twitched. Almost a smile. "Fair."

They lay there in comfortable silence. Morning light. Warm sheets. The kind of quiet that felt like contentment instead of absence.

"Coffee?" Noel asked.

"Yeah."

Eben started to get up, but Noel caught his hand. "I'll make it. You stay."

"You sure?"

"Yeah. I know where everything is in my own kitchen." Noel grinned. "Unlike some people."

"I know where everything is in your kitchen."

"You do, actually." The realization settled warm in Noel's chest. "When did that happen?"

"I don't know." Eben's thumb brushed across Noel's knuckles. "Somewhere between the third disaster and the fifth coffee run."

"That's very specific."

"I'm a specific person."

"You're a ridiculous person."

"Also accurate."

Noel kissed him. Soft. Easy. The kind of kiss that said *good morning* and *I'm glad you're here* and *this is nice.*

When he pulled back, Eben was looking at him with an expression Noel couldn't quite read.

"What?" Noel asked.

"Nothing. Just—" Eben paused. "This is nice."

There it was. That tiny hesitation. A fraction of a second too long before the words.

Noel noticed.

Didn't address it.

That was the first mistake.

---

Noel made coffee in his kitchen, humming under his breath, and told himself it was fine.

Eben was allowed to hesitate. Allowed to be uncertain. This was new for both of them. Big feelings. Big promises. The kind of vulnerability that made you want to run even when you wanted to stay.

Noel understood that.

He did.

So he ignored the tiny voice in the back of his head that whispered: *Something's wrong.*

He ignored the way Eben had gone very still when Noel said *this is nice.*

He ignored the fact that Eben's smile hadn't quite reached his eyes.

Hope was dangerous when it made you blind.

But Noel was choosing to be blind.

Because the alternative—acknowledging that something had shifted overnight, that the fear from last night's conversation hadn't disappeared, that Eben might be pulling away even as he stayed—was too terrifying to face.

So Noel made coffee. Added cream to Eben's cup the way he liked it. Carried both mugs back to the bedroom.

And pretended everything was fine.

---

Eben was sitting up in bed, checking his phone. He looked up when Noel entered. Took the coffee mug with a quiet "Thanks."

Their fingers brushed. Lingered.

Noel sat on the edge of the bed. "Big day today."

"Gala rehearsal."

"Yeah. Final run-through before the actual event tomorrow." Noel sipped his coffee. "Mayor Kringle is probably already having a breakdown."

"Probably."

"We should get there early. Make sure everything's set up properly."

"Yeah."

Eben's responses were short. Clipped. Not cold, exactly, but—distant. Like he was somewhere else even though he was sitting right there.

Noel's stomach tightened.

"You okay?" he asked.

"Yeah. Just thinking."

"About what?"

"The gala. Making sure we didn't miss anything."

It was a reasonable answer. A logical answer.

It was also a lie.

Noel could tell. Could see it in the way Eben wouldn't quite meet his eyes. In the way his shoulders were tense even though they were alone, safe, together.

"Eben—"

"We should get ready." Eben set down his coffee. Stood. "Don't want to be late."

And just like that, the moment was over.

Noel sat on the bed, holding his coffee, watching Eben move around the room like everything was normal.

Like nothing had changed.

Like that tiny hesitation didn't mean anything.

But it did.

Noel knew it did.

He just didn't know what to do about it.

---

They got ready in comfortable silence. Or what should have been comfortable silence.

Instead, it felt—off. Like they were moving around each other carefully. Like they were both trying not to say something.

Eben pulled on his shirt. Noel watched him in the mirror.

"Three days left," Noel said quietly.

Eben's hands stilled on his buttons. "Until what?"

"Until Christmas. Until the twelve days are over."

"Right."

"What happens then?"

Eben turned. Looked at him. "What do you mean?"

"I mean—" Noel gestured between them. "This. Us. Does it—does it keep going? After the festival?"

"I told you it does."

"I know. I just—" Noel paused. "I wanted to make sure."

"You don't believe me?"

"I do. I just—" *I'm scared.* "I wanted to hear it again."

Eben crossed to him. Took his hands. "I'm staying. I meant what I said. I love you. This doesn't end when the festival ends."

The words were right. Perfect, even.

But something in Eben's eyes didn't match them.

Something that looked like fear.

Noel should have asked about it. Should have pushed. Should have said: *What are you afraid of?*

But he didn't.

Because he was afraid too.

Afraid that if he asked, Eben would tell him the truth.

And the truth might be something Noel couldn't fix.

So he smiled. Squeezed Eben's hands. Said, "Okay. Good."

And let it go.

That was the second mistake.

---

They left for Merryweather Hall together.

Walked through the cold morning air, breath fogging, shoulders brushing.

Noel's ribbon caught the light. Red and bright and impossible to miss.

A promise tied in silk.

A promise Eben had made.

A promise Noel desperately wanted to believe.

But as they walked, Noel couldn't shake the feeling that something was coming.

Something big. Something inevitable.

Something that would test everything they'd just promised each other.

The narrator would have told him to pay attention to that feeling.

Would have said: *When your gut screams danger, listen.*

But Noel was too busy being happy.

Too busy pretending everything was fine.

Too busy ignoring the warning signs.

And by the time he realized his mistake, it would be too late.
