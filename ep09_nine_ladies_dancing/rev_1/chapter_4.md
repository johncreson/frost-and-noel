## Chapter 4: The Snap

**EBEN**

Eben's entire body felt like it was shutting down.

Fight or flight. Except he couldn't do either.

He was just—frozen. Standing in this small room with Noel looking at him like he'd just been stabbed, and Eben couldn't move. Couldn't speak. Couldn't do anything except stand there and watch everything fall apart.

*Say something,* his brain screamed. *Say anything.*

But his mouth wouldn't cooperate. Because the truth was too big. Too terrifying. Too real.

And the lie—the old pattern, the survival instinct—was right there. Ready. Familiar.

*Destroy it before it destroys you.*

---

"Eben." Noel's voice was quiet. Controlled. "Was this ever real to you?"

The question hit like a physical blow.

*Yes,* Eben wanted to say. *Yes, it's real. It's the most real thing I've ever had.*

But the words wouldn't come. Because saying them out loud meant admitting how much he needed this. How much he needed Noel. How completely and utterly terrified he was of losing it.

And Eben had spent his entire life not needing anyone. Not depending on anyone. Not letting anyone close enough to hurt him.

And now here he was. Completely exposed. Completely vulnerable.

And his entire body was screaming at him to run.

---

"I don't—" Eben started. Stopped. Tried again. "This isn't—"

The words tangled in his throat. Noel's expression shifted. Something hard and hurt flickering in his eyes.

"This isn't what?" Noel asked. His voice was very quiet. Very careful. "Real?"

*No. That's not what I meant.*

But Eben couldn't say it. Couldn't explain. Couldn't make his brain and his mouth work together long enough to say what he actually meant.

Which was: *This is too real. This is too much. I don't know how to do this.*

But all that came out was: "I don't know."

And Noel flinched like he'd been hit.

---

"You don't know," Noel repeated.

"I didn't mean—"

"You don't know if this is real."

"That's not what I said."

"It's what you meant."

"No. I just—" Eben ran a hand through his hair. "I panicked. Out there. I didn't know what to say."

"So you said nothing."

"Yes."

"And left me to handle it alone."

"I'm sorry."

"Are you?"

The question was sharp. Pointed.

Eben met Noel's eyes. "Yes. I'm sorry. I should have said something. I should have—"

"Should have what? Claimed me? Acknowledged us? Acted like you actually want this?"

"I do want this."

"Do you? Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're trying to find the exit."

The words landed like a punch. Because they were true.

Eben *was* looking for the exit. Had been looking for it since the moment he woke up this morning. Since the moment he realized how happy he was. How much he wanted this to last.

Because happiness was dangerous. Happiness made you soft. Happiness gave you something to lose.

And Eben had spent his entire life making sure he had nothing to lose.

---

"I'm not—" Eben started.

"You are." Noel's voice cracked. "You're pulling away. I can feel it. You've been pulling away all day."

"I haven't—"

"You have! This morning. The hesitation. The distance. The way you won't look at me. The way you—" Noel's hands clenched. "You're running. You're just doing it while standing still."

Eben's chest tightened. Because Noel was right.

He was running. Had been running since the moment he realized he was in love. Since the moment he realized he wanted to stay. Since the moment he realized that staying meant risking everything.

"I'm scared," Eben said quietly.

The admission felt like ripping open a wound. Noel went very still. "Of what?"

"This. Us. How much I—" Eben stopped. Swallowed. "How much I want this to work."

"Then why are you pulling away?"

"Because I don't know how to do this!" The words came out louder than he meant. Sharper. "I don't know how to—to be this vulnerable. To need someone this much. To—"

He stopped. Took a breath. Tried to find the words.

"I've spent my entire life not needing anyone," he said finally. "Not depending on anyone. Not letting anyone close enough to hurt me. And now you're—you're *here*. And I—"

His voice broke. "I don't know how to do this without destroying it."

---

The silence that followed was deafening. Noel stared at him. Expression unreadable.

"So that's it?" Noel said finally. "You're scared, so you're just going to—what? Walk away?"

"I'm not walking away."

"You're not staying either."

"I am staying. I told you I'm staying."

"You told me a lot of things." Noel's voice was flat. "You told me you loved me. You told me you wanted this. You told me it was real. And then the first time it got hard—the first time you had to actually *show* it—you froze."

"I know. I know I messed up. But I'm trying—"

"Trying what? To figure out how to leave without it being your fault?"

The accusation hit like a blade.

"That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Noel's eyes were bright. Angry. Hurt. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're doing exactly what you always do. You're finding a reason to run before I can leave you first."

Eben's breath caught. Because that was—that was exactly what he was doing. And Noel knew it.

---

"I'm not—" Eben started.

But he couldn't finish. Because it was true. All of it.

He was scared. He was running. He was looking for the exit. Because that's what he did. That's what he'd always done.

Destroy it before it destroys you. It was the only way he knew how to survive.

"This was never supposed to—"

The words slipped out before he could stop them. Eben froze. Noel went very, very still.

"Finish the sentence," Noel said quietly.

"Noel—"

"Finish it."

Eben's throat closed. He should stop. Should backtrack. Should explain what he actually meant.

But his walls were up. His defenses activated. And the old pattern was running the show. And the old pattern said: *End it now. Before it ends you.*

So he did.
