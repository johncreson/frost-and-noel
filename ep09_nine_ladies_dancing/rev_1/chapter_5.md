## Chapter 5: The Wound Strike

**EBEN**

"This was never supposed to last."

The words hung in the air like smoke.

Eben heard himself say them. Felt them leave his mouth. Watched them land on Noel like a physical blow.

And he wanted—desperately, viscerally—to take them back. But it was too late. The damage was done.

---

Noel's face went blank. Not angry. Not hurt. Just—blank.

Empty. Like someone had reached inside him and turned off all the lights.

And that was worse. So much worse than anger. So much worse than tears.

Because blank meant Noel had expected this. Blank meant Noel had been waiting for this. Blank meant Noel's wound had just been proven right.

*You're not enough. You're never enough.*

And Eben had just confirmed it.

---

"Okay," Noel said.

His voice was quiet. Flat. Completely devoid of emotion. And that single word—that simple, devastating *okay*—hit Eben like a freight train.

"Noel—"

"No. It's okay. I get it."

"You don't—"

"I do." Noel's smile was small. Sad. "You were clear from the beginning. Temporary. Just until the festival ended. I just—" He laughed. It sounded broken. "I just forgot."

"That's not what I meant."

"Isn't it?"

"No. I meant—" Eben stopped. Because what *had* he meant? "I meant this was never supposed to get this serious. This intense. I wasn't supposed to—"

He couldn't finish.

Couldn't say *I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you.*

Couldn't say *I wasn't supposed to need you this much.*

Couldn't say *I wasn't supposed to be this terrified of losing you.*

Because saying any of that would mean admitting how completely he'd failed at keeping his distance. How completely he'd let Noel in. How completely he was about to destroy the best thing that had ever happened to him.

---

"After the festival," Eben heard himself say. "That was always the plan."

*Stop talking,* his brain screamed. *Stop. You're making it worse.*

But he couldn't stop. The words kept coming. Automatic. Defensive. The old script running on autopilot.

"We said temporary. We agreed."

"We did," Noel said quietly. "You're right."

"So this—what happened out there—it doesn't change anything."

"No. I guess it doesn't."

Noel's voice was so calm. So accepting. And Eben wanted to scream. Wanted to grab Noel and shake him and say: *Fight me. Yell at me. Tell me I'm wrong.*

But Noel just stood there. Blank. Accepting. Like he'd known this was coming all along.

---

"I should go," Noel said.

"What?"

"I should go. You're right. This was—it was temporary. And I—" His voice cracked. Just slightly. "I let myself forget that. But I won't make that mistake again."

"Noel, wait—"

"No. It's fine. Really." Noel moved toward the door. "We still have the gala tomorrow. We can be professional. Get through it. And then—"

He stopped. Took a breath.

"And then it's done. Like we agreed."

The words felt like a death sentence.

"That's not what I want," Eben said.

The admission slipped out. Raw. Honest. Noel paused. Hand on the doorknob.

"Then what do you want?" he asked quietly.

And Eben—Eben didn't know how to answer.

Because what he wanted was impossible. He wanted Noel. Wanted this. Wanted to stay.

But he also wanted to not be terrified. Wanted to not be vulnerable. Wanted to not risk losing everything. And he couldn't have both.

So he said nothing. And Noel's shoulders sagged.

"That's what I thought," Noel said.

And he left.

---

The door closed with a soft click.

And Eben stood alone in the empty room, staring at the space where Noel had been.

*What did I just do?*

He'd said the worst possible thing. Had taken every fear, every wound, every defense mechanism he had and weaponized them against the person he loved most.

Had destroyed the best thing in his life because he was too scared to keep it.

And Noel had just—accepted it. Hadn't fought. Hadn't argued. Hadn't tried to change his mind. Had just said *okay* and walked away.

Like he'd been expecting it. Like he'd known, all along, that Eben would do this. That Eben would run. That Eben would choose fear over love.

---

Eben sank into a chair. Put his head in his hands. And tried to breathe.

*This was never supposed to last.*

He'd said it. Out loud. To Noel's face. Had taken the lie they'd both been telling themselves and made it real.

Except it *was* a lie. Because Eben wanted it to last. Wanted Noel to stay. Wanted this—whatever this was—to be permanent.

But he'd been too scared to say it. Too scared to fight for it. Too scared to be vulnerable enough to admit how much he needed it.

So instead, he'd destroyed it. Preemptively. Before it could destroy him.

---

The pattern was so familiar it hurt.

This was what he did. This was what he'd always done.

Someone got too close, and he pushed them away. Someone made him feel too much, and he shut down. Someone made him want to stay, and he found a reason to leave.

It was survival. It was protection. It was the only way he knew how to keep himself safe.

Except—except Noel's face. That blank, accepting *okay.* The sound of someone who'd expected this all along. The sound of someone whose worst fear had just been confirmed.

*You're not enough. You're never enough.*

And Eben had just proven it.

---

He sat there for a long time. Alone in the empty room. Replaying the conversation. Replaying Noel's face. Replaying the moment everything broke.

And he thought: *I just lost him.*

*I just lost the best thing that ever happened to me. And I did it on purpose.*

The realization settled in his chest like lead. Heavy. Suffocating. Undeniable.

He'd been so scared of losing Noel that he'd destroyed the relationship himself. Had taken the fear of abandonment and turned it into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Had proven, once again, that attachment destroys everything.

Except—except he was the one who'd done the destroying. Not Noel. Not the universe. Not fate or circumstance or bad timing.

Him. He'd done this.

And he didn't know how to fix it. Didn't know if he *could* fix it. Didn't know if Noel would even want him to try.

---

Eben stood. Walked to the window. Looked out at Merryweather Hall, still decorated and beautiful and full of people preparing for tomorrow's gala.

Tomorrow. They'd have to see each other tomorrow. Have to work together. Be professional. Pretend everything was fine.

Pretend they hadn't just destroyed each other.

The thought made him sick. But what choice did he have?

He'd made his decision. Had said the words. Had pushed Noel away. And Noel had let him.

It was done. Over. Exactly like he'd said it would be.

*This was never supposed to last.*

Except it was supposed to. It was supposed to last forever. And Eben had just thrown it away.

Because he was too scared to hold on. Because he was too broken to believe he deserved it. Because he was too much of a coward to fight for what he wanted.

And now it was too late. Now Noel was gone.

And Eben was alone. Again. Just like he'd always been. Just like he'd always known he would be.

The only difference was—this time, he had no one to blame but himself.
