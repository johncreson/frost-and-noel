## Chapter 7: Hook Ending

**EBEN**

Eben drove.

He didn't remember getting in his car. Didn't remember leaving Merryweather Hall. He just found himself on the dark roads outside town, headlights cutting through the December night, with no idea where he was going.

Anywhere. Nowhere. Away.

---

The roads were empty.

Everyone was home. Warm. Safe. Preparing for Christmas. Everyone except Eben, who was driving through the dark, replaying the worst conversation of his life.

*This was never supposed to last.*

He'd said it. Out loud. To Noel's face. And he hadn't meant it. Not the way it sounded. Not the way Noel had heard it.

What he'd meant was: *This wasn't supposed to get this serious. I wasn't supposed to fall this hard.*

But that's not what he'd said. And now Noel thought it had all been a lie. Thought Eben had been planning to leave all along.

Thought he didn't matter.

And Eben had let him think it. Had watched Noel's face go blank and hadn't corrected him. Hadn't fought. Hadn't explained. He had just let him go.

---

Eben pulled over.

Parked on the side of the road, engine still running. He sat there, hands on the wheel, and tried to breathe.

*What did I just do?*

He'd panicked. That's what happened. The photos appeared. The crowd cheered. And Eben's entire body had gone into fight-or-flight mode.

Except he couldn't fight. And he couldn't flee. So he'd just—frozen.

He had stood there like a coward while Noel handled it alone. While Noel smiled and deflected and denied them in front of everyone because Eben hadn't given him any other choice.

---

And then the confrontation. The private room. The questions. The fear.

*Was this ever real to you?*

Yes. God, yes. It was the most real thing Eben had ever had. But he couldn't say it. Because saying it meant admitting how much he needed it—how completely and utterly terrified he was of losing it.

Eben didn't know how to be that vulnerable. He didn't know how to trust that it wouldn't destroy him.

So instead, he'd destroyed it himself.

---

*This was never supposed to last.*

The words echoed in his head. A lie he'd told to protect himself, now a weapon that had cost him everything.

Because Noel had believed him. Had taken those words at face value and walked away in that flat, devastated voice.

---

He should go back. Should find Noel. Explain. Apologize. Tell him the truth: *I love you. I want this. I'm just terrified.*

But what if Noel didn't believe him? What if the damage was already done?

What if Eben had finally pushed too hard, run too far, destroyed the one thing he couldn't afford to lose?

The thought made him sick.

---

Eben turned off the engine. Sat in the dark. And faced the truth.

He'd spent his entire life building defenses to keep people out. He'd perfected the art of not needing anyone, convinced that attachment was dangerous and vulnerability was weakness.

And it had worked. For years, he'd been safe. Protected. Invulnerable.

And completely, utterly alone.

Until Noel.

---

Noel, who'd slipped past every defense Eben had. Who'd made him laugh. Made him care. Made him want to stay.

Noel had looked at all of Eben's sharp edges and said: *I see you. And I'm not going anywhere.* He'd been patient, willing to wait while Eben figured out how to let him in. He'd trusted Eben with his own wounds.

He'd said *I love you* first. He'd tied a ribbon on Eben's wrist and asked him to stay.

And Eben had said yes. Had wanted—desperately—to be the kind of person who could keep that promise.

But when it mattered, he'd frozen. He'd chosen fear. And now Noel was gone.

---

Eben's phone buzzed. A text from Sam: *Heard what happened. You okay?*

Eben stared at the message. Was he okay?

No. He'd just destroyed the best thing in his life because he was too scared to keep it. But he couldn't say that. So he didn't respond. He just put the phone away and sat in the dark.

---

The pattern was so clear now.

Destroy it before it destroys you. That's what he'd always done. Someone got too close, and he pushed them away. Someone made him feel too much, and he shut down. Someone made him want to stay, and he found a reason to leave.

It was the only way he knew how to keep himself safe. Except it didn't keep him safe. It just kept him alone.

And this time, he'd destroyed something that actually mattered. Something real. Something worth fighting for.

And he'd done it on purpose.

---

Eben started the car and drove home.

His apartment was dark, cold, and empty. Exactly how it had always been.

He stood in the doorway and thought: *This is what I protected. This empty, lonely space where no one can hurt me.*

*Where I'm safe. Where I'm alone.*

And for the first time in his life, he hated it.

---

He sat on the couch in the dark and replayed the day. The morning hesitation. The gala. The photos.

Noel's face when the crowd cheered. The way he'd looked to Eben for backup. The way Eben had frozen.

And then the fight. The terrible, catastrophic words.

*This was never supposed to last.*

Noel's blank *okay.* The sound of the door closing. The silence that followed.

---

*I just lost him.*

The realization settled in his chest like lead. He'd been so scared of losing Noel that he'd triggered the abandonment himself. He'd taken the fear and turned it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

He'd proven—once again—that attachment destroys everything. Except he was the one who'd done the destroying. Not the universe.

Him. He'd done this. And he didn't know how to undo it.

---

Eben sat alone and realized that he had spent his whole life building walls to keep people out. He just hadn't expected to be the one trapped inside.

And now he was alone with his fear and his carefully constructed distance, and no idea how to break free. No idea if Noel would even want him to try.

---

Tomorrow, they'd have to see each other. Work together. Be professional. Get through the gala.

Pretend everything was fine. Pretend they hadn't just destroyed each other.

The thought made him sick. But what choice did he have? He'd made his decision. Had pushed Noel away. And Noel had let him.

It was done. Over. Exactly like he'd said it would be.

*This was never supposed to last.*

Except it was supposed to. It was supposed to last forever. And Eben had thrown it away because he was too scared to hold on. Because he was too broken to believe he deserved it.

And now Noel was gone. And Eben was alone in the dark, with nothing but his regret and the devastating knowledge that he'd done this to himself.

He'd destroyed the one thing that mattered. On purpose.

Because he didn't know how to do anything else.

---

Eben sat in the dark. And didn't cry.

He just sat there. Alone. The way he'd always been.

The only difference was, this time he knew exactly what he'd lost.

And exactly who was to blame.
