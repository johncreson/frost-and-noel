## BLURB

Everything was perfect.

That should have been the warning.

Noel Merrick has never been this happy. Eben loves him. The festival is thriving. For the first time in years, he feels like he doesn't have to hold everything together alone.

Then the call comes.

Chicago. A contract Eben can't refuse. An opportunity that was always going to come—Noel just didn't expect it to hurt this much.

Eben said he'd stay. Eben said he loved him. But love and staying aren't always the same thing, and Noel has been left before.

The fight that follows breaks something neither of them expected.

**Day nine of twelve. Some cracks can't be fixed with glitter.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring relationship conflict, the rupture before HEA, grumpy-sunshine dynamics, explicit heat, and a guaranteed happy ending.*
