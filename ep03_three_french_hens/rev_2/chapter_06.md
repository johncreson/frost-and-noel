# Chapter 6: The Walk

The next day started normal.

Noel arrived at Merryweather Hall. Checked his emails. Coordinated with vendors. Did all the professional, competent things he was supposed to do.

Eben was there. Also being professional. Also being competent.

They nodded at each other across the hall.

It was very mature.

It lasted approximately two hours.

---

At ten-thirty, Noel's phone buzzed.

**Eben:** *Need to check the lighting setup at Evergreen Square. Want to come?*

Noel stared at the message.

It was a work request. Completely reasonable. They were co-managing the festival. Of course they'd need to coordinate on-site.

Except.

Except it felt like more than that.

**Noel:** *Sure. Meet you there?*

**Eben:** *I'll walk with you.*

Noel's heart did something complicated.

*Professional. This is professional.*

He grabbed his coat.

---

They walked through Tinsel Town in silence.

It wasn't the tense silence from yesterday. It was something else. Something almost comfortable, if comfort could coexist with the constant awareness of another person's presence.

Noel was hyperaware of Eben beside him. The way he moved. The way his breath fogged in the cold air. The way their shoulders almost brushed with every step.

"You're quiet," Eben observed.

"Thinking."

"About?"

*You. Always you. The kiss. What happens next. Whether I'm reading this completely wrong.*

"Work," Noel said.

Eben's expression suggested he didn't believe that, but he didn't push.

They reached Evergreen Square. The main festival space was already taking shape—vendor booths, string lights, a small stage for performances. It looked magical, even half-finished.

Eben pulled out a tablet, started checking measurements against the plan.

Noel watched him work.

"The lights need to be higher," Eben said, pointing to a strand that was sagging. "And that booth is three feet off-center."

"You measured that by looking?"

"Yes."

"That's unsettling."

Eben's mouth twitched. "It's efficient."

"It's unsettling efficiency."

This time, Eben almost smiled. "I'll take that as a compliment."

"You would."

They fell into an easy rhythm—Eben identifying problems, Noel coordinating solutions. It was the same dynamic they'd had since the beginning, but something about it felt different now. Less adversarial. More... partnership.

Noel liked it.

Liked it more than was probably safe.

---

An hour later, the square was sorted.

Lights adjusted. Booths realigned. Everything exactly as it should be.

They stood in the center of the space, surrounded by twinkling lights and the smell of pine, and Noel realized he didn't want to leave.

"We should head back," Eben said.

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

The square was quiet. Most of the vendors had left for lunch. It was just them, standing in the cold, snow starting to fall again.

"Noel."

Eben's voice was different. Softer.

Noel looked at him.

Eben was watching him with an expression Noel couldn't quite read. Something careful. Something vulnerable.

"Last night," Eben started. "When I said I didn't know what this meant—"

"I know."

"I wasn't—" Eben stopped. Took a breath. "I wasn't lying. I don't know. But I—"

He stopped again.

Noel waited.

The snow fell around them. The lights twinkled. The world felt very small and very large all at once.

"I want to find out," Eben said finally.

Noel's breath caught.

"What?"

"I want to find out what this means." Eben's jaw was tight, like the admission cost him something. "If you—if that's something you want."

Noel stared at him.

Eben Frost, controlled and careful and emotionally unavailable, was standing in the middle of Evergreen Square asking if Noel wanted to see where this went.

"Yes," Noel said. "Yes, I want that."

Something in Eben's expression eased.

"Okay."

"Okay."

They stood there, looking at each other, and Noel felt like something fundamental had just shifted.

---

They walked back to the hall together.

Didn't talk about what had just happened. Didn't define it or analyze it or make plans.

Just walked, close enough that their hands almost touched, and let the possibility of it settle between them.

When they reached Merryweather Hall, Eben stopped.

"Tonight," he said. "After work. Do you want to—"

"Yes."

Eben blinked. "I didn't finish the question."

"Doesn't matter. The answer is yes."

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. Almost amusement. Almost fondness.

"Seven o'clock," he said. "I'll meet you here."

"Okay."

Eben nodded once and walked inside.

Noel stood in the cold, heart racing.

They were doing this.

Whatever *this* was.

---

At seven o'clock exactly, Eben appeared.

He'd changed—not into anything fancy, just a different jacket, cleaner boots. But the effort was there. Visible.

They walked.

The town was beautiful in the evening. Lights everywhere, snow falling gently, the kind of picture-perfect winter scene that belonged on a postcard.

They turned down a quieter street. Fewer lights here. More shadows.

"Noel," Eben said.

His voice was rough. Careful.

Noel's heart was racing.

"Yeah?"

"I want to kiss you again."

The world narrowed to just them.

"Yes. Please."

Eben stepped closer.

Eben kissed him.

It was different from the first time. Slower. More deliberate. Like Eben was trying to memorize the moment.

Noel kissed back, hands fisting in Eben's jacket, and felt something in his chest crack open.

This was real.

This was happening.

When they pulled apart, they were both breathing hard.

Snow fell around them. The street was empty. The night was just beginning.

And everything had changed.
