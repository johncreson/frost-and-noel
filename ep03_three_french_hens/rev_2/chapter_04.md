# Chapter 4: Quiet Kindness

The back room of Candle & Crumb was quieter than the main bakery.

Noel had ducked in to grab more napkins—or that's what he'd told himself. Really, he'd needed a moment. A breath. Space to think about the fact that he and Eben had just had an almost-normal conversation and Noel's entire nervous system was still processing it.

He found the napkins. Stood there holding them like they might contain answers.

They didn't.

Through the partially open door, he could hear the bakery winding down. Contestants chatting, packing up their things. Wes's calm voice directing cleanup. The comfortable sounds of an event ending well.

Then he heard something else.

A younger voice, shaky. On the edge of tears.

"I can't— It's not working. I don't know what I'm doing wrong."

Noel moved closer to the door.

In the main room, one of the contestants—the nervous young man from earlier—was standing at his station, staring at a collapsed pastry with the kind of despair usually reserved for actual tragedies.

Eben was there.

Noel watched as Eben set down whatever he'd been carrying and moved to the young man's side. Not hovering. Just... present.

"What happened?" Eben asked. His voice was different. Softer than Noel had ever heard it.

"I don't know." The young man's hands were shaking. "I followed the recipe exactly, but it just—it fell apart. Everything I make falls apart."

There was more than pastry failure in those words.

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then he crouched down—actually crouched—so he was at eye level with the ruined dessert.

"Show me what you did," he said.

The young man walked him through it. Eben listened. Didn't interrupt. Didn't judge. Just listened with the kind of attention that made it clear he actually cared about the answer.

"There," Eben said when the explanation finished. "You over-mixed. See how the batter's dense? That's gluten development. For this recipe, you want to fold, not stir."

"I don't know how to fold."

"I'll show you."

And he did.

Noel stood in the doorway, frozen, as Eben Frost—controlled, distant, emotionally unavailable Eben Frost—patiently walked a stranger through the mechanics of folding batter. His hands moved with careful precision, demonstrating the motion. His voice stayed gentle, encouraging.

"Like this. See? Light touch. You're not forcing it. You're coaxing it."

The young man tried. Failed. Tried again.

"Better," Eben said. "Keep going."

Three attempts later, the batter came together properly. The young man stared at it like it had performed a miracle.

"I did it."

"You did."

"I actually—" The young man's voice cracked. "Thank you. I know it's just baking, but—"

"It's not just baking," Eben said quietly. "It's proof that you can learn. That you can try something difficult and succeed. That matters."

The young man nodded, blinking rapidly.

Eben stood, brushed flour off his knees, and rested a hand briefly on the young man's shoulder. "You'll be fine."

Then he moved away, back to whatever task he'd been doing before, like he hadn't just completely rewired Noel's understanding of who he was.

Noel stood in the doorway, napkins forgotten, heart doing acrobatics.

*Oh no.*

---

This was bad.

This was very bad.

Noel had been managing, barely, when Eben was just attractive and competent and occasionally almost-funny. He could handle that. He could keep it professional, keep it temporary, keep it from meaning anything.

But this?

Eben being *kind*—genuinely, quietly kind, in a way that expected nothing in return?

Noel's defenses didn't stand a chance.

He forced himself to move. Walked back into the main bakery with the napkins, set them on the counter, tried to look normal.

Eben glanced up. Their eyes met.

Noel looked away so fast he nearly gave himself whiplash.

*Professional. Be professional. Do not think about the way he crouched down to help that kid. Do not think about his voice going soft. Do not—*

"Noel?"

Wes was beside him, looking concerned.

"You okay? You look a little..."

"Fine," Noel said automatically. "I'm fine."

Wes's expression suggested he didn't believe that for a second, but he didn't push. Just handed Noel a cup of water and moved on.

Noel drank it. Tried to think.

This was temporary. The partnership, the festival, whatever was happening between them—all of it was temporary. Eben would leave after Christmas. Noel would stay. That was the plan.

That had always been the plan.

So it didn't matter that Eben was kind. It didn't matter that he'd helped a stranger with the same careful attention he brought to everything. It didn't matter that Noel had just witnessed something that made his chest ache.

None of it mattered.

Noel repeated this to himself several times.

His heart didn't listen.

---

The bakery emptied slowly.

Contestants left with their creations—winners and losers alike, all smiling, all covered in varying amounts of flour. Hugh finished sweeping and escaped before Wes could assign him additional penance. The young man Eben had helped waved goodbye with something like hope on his face.

Soon it was just Noel, Eben, and Wes.

"You two did well today," Wes said, wiping down the counter. "Despite the chaos."

"Hugh's chaos," Noel corrected.

"Hugh's chaos," Wes agreed. "But you handled it. Both of you."

He said it casually, but there was weight behind the words. Acknowledgment. Approval.

Noel felt something warm settle in his chest.

"We should go," Eben said. He was pulling on his coat, careful and methodical. "Let you close up."

"I'm in no rush." Wes's smile was knowing. "But yes, you should probably go. Together, ideally."

There it was again. That pointed emphasis.

Noel shot him a look. Wes's smile didn't waver.

"Come on," Eben said quietly.

Noel followed him out into the cold.

---

The sun was setting. The sky had gone pink and gold, the kind of winter sunset that made everything look softer. Snow was starting to fall—light, lazy flakes that caught the streetlights.

Tinsel Town was beautiful like this. Quiet. Peaceful.

Noel couldn't appreciate any of it.

He was too busy being hyperaware of Eben walking beside him. Close enough that their shoulders almost brushed. Far enough that they weren't quite touching.

Neither of them spoke.

The silence stretched, loaded with everything they weren't saying.

Noel's apartment was in the opposite direction from Eben's rental. They both knew this. They were walking the same direction anyway.

Noel should say something. Should address it. Should—

"You were good with him," Noel said before he could stop himself.

Eben glanced over. "Who?"

"The kid. The one whose pastry collapsed."

"Oh." Eben's expression shuttered slightly. "He just needed guidance."

"You were patient."

"It wasn't difficult."

"It was kind."

Eben stopped walking.

Noel stopped too, heart suddenly racing.

They stood on the quiet street, snow falling around them, and looked at each other.

"It wasn't—" Eben started, then stopped. His jaw tightened. "I just helped him. That's all."

"That's not all," Noel said softly.

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. Uncertainty. Vulnerability. Gone before Noel could name it.

"We should keep moving," Eben said. "It's cold."

He started walking again.

Noel followed, chest tight.

*Great. Perfect. Emotionally unavailable glacier man was also secretly kind. Noel's type, apparently, was 'everything he thought he didn't want, served in one devastating package.'*

He was in so much trouble.

---

They walked in silence for another block.

The streets were emptying as people headed home for dinner. Lights glowed in windows. Somewhere, someone was playing Christmas music—faint, cheerful, incongruous with the tension humming between them.

Noel's mind was racing.

He kept replaying the moment in the bakery. Eben crouching down. His voice going soft. The way he'd made that young man feel capable, valued, seen.

The way Noel wanted—desperately, dangerously—to be on the receiving end of that attention.

*Stop. This doesn't matter. It was one kiss.*

*A really good kiss.*

*That didn't matter either.*

Except it did.

It mattered that Eben was kind. It mattered that he helped people without expecting anything in return. It mattered that beneath the controlled exterior was someone who cared, even if he didn't want to admit it.

It mattered that Noel was falling for him.

The thought arrived fully formed, undeniable.

Noel stumbled.

Eben's hand shot out, steadying him.

"Careful."

His grip was firm. Warm through Noel's coat.

Noel looked up. Met Eben's eyes.

They were standing too close. Close enough that Noel could see the flour still dusting Eben's hair. Close enough to count the shades of gray in his eyes.

Close enough to kiss.

Eben's hand was still on his arm.

Neither of them moved.

"Noel," Eben said quietly.

It wasn't a question. It wasn't a statement. It was just his name, said in a voice that made Noel's breath catch.

The moment stretched.

Then Eben let go and stepped back.

"We should—" He cleared his throat. "The bake-off. Tomorrow. We need to coordinate."

Right. Work. Professional things.

"Right," Noel managed. "Tomorrow."

They started walking again.

But something had shifted.

Something was building between them, inevitable and terrifying, and Noel didn't know how to stop it.

Wasn't sure he wanted to.
