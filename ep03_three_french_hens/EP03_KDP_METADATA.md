## BLURB

He said yes.

Noel Merrick is still processing the fact that Eben Frost—controlled, careful, commitment-averse Eben—just agreed to see where this goes. Whatever "this" is.

What he didn't expect was how fast "where this goes" would involve a dark street, a quiet confession, and an invitation he probably shouldn't have given.

Eben knows better than to stay the night. Knows better than to let himself want this much. Knows that temporary means leaving, and leaving means not getting attached, and he's already attached in ways that should terrify him.

But Noel is looking at him like he's something worth having.

And Eben has never been good at saying no to things he wants.

**Day three of twelve. Some lines can't be uncrossed.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring grumpy-sunshine dynamics, forced proximity, first-time intimacy, explicit heat, and a guaranteed HEA.*
