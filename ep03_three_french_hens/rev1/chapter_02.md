# Chapter 2: Bake-off Brief

The kiss had been a mistake.

Obviously.

Eben had spent the entire night cataloging the reasons why. The list was extensive. Well-organized. Convincing.

None of it mattered, because he could still feel Noel's mouth on his.

This was a problem.

Eben adjusted the oven temperature for station three and tried to focus. The bake-off was simple: twelve contestants, three hours, minimal supervision required. He'd handled more complicated logistics in his sleep. This should be easy.

It wasn't easy.

Noel was across the bakery, laughing at something a contestant said. Bright, genuine laughter that made his whole face change. Eben had noticed this approximately forty-seven times in the past hour and was beginning to suspect he had a problem that went beyond poor decision-making.

"Interesting day yesterday?"

Eben didn't jump. He had more self-control than that. But it was close.

Wes was beside him, wiping down the counter with a cloth that didn't need wiping. His expression was mild. Friendly. Deeply suspicious.

"Standard," Eben said.

"Mmm."

That was it. Just *mmm*. But the sound contained multitudes. Wes had a gift for packing entire conversations into single syllables.

Eben hated it.

"The bake-off should run smoothly," Eben said, because redirecting was a valid strategy. "You've prepared well."

"I always do." Wes folded the cloth with unnecessary precision. "Though preparation only goes so far when people are... distracted."

Eben's jaw tightened. "I'm not distracted."

"Of course not." Wes's smile was gentle. Infuriating. "Neither is Noel, I'm sure. He's been very focused. Haven't seen him look your way once."

Eben said nothing. Across the bakery, Noel was helping an elderly woman tie her apron. His hands were careful. Patient.

Eben looked away.

"Right," Wes said softly. "Not distracted at all."

He drifted off to greet new arrivals, leaving Eben standing alone near the ovens, feeling like he'd just failed a test he hadn't known he was taking.

The contestants were a mix of Tinsel Town regulars and a few brave souls from neighboring areas. Eben recognized most of them: the librarian who made exceptional shortbread, the postal worker with a fondness for elaborate layer cakes, the teenager who'd won last year with a pie that had made grown adults weep.

They were cheerful. Excited. Completely unaware that Eben was having a minor crisis in the corner.

He forced himself to focus. Checked that each station had the required equipment. Confirmed oven schedules. Answered questions about ingredient substitutions with the kind of patience that came from years of managing other people's chaos.

This was fine. He was fine.

Then Noel laughed again—that same unguarded sound—and Eben's concentration shattered.

This was not fine.

The kiss had been a lapse in judgment. A momentary weakness caused by exhaustion and proximity and the way Noel had looked at him in that tiny office, like Eben was something worth wanting. That wasn't a reason. That was an excuse.

Eben didn't do excuses.

He also didn't do whatever this was: standing in a bakery pretending to review a supply list while actually tracking Noel's location like his life depended on it.

"Mr. Frost?"

Eben blinked. One of the contestants—a nervous young man with flour already on his shirt—was hovering nearby.

"Yes?"

"I can't find the vanilla extract."

Eben located it in under ten seconds. The man thanked him profusely and scurried back to his station.

Simple. Manageable. This was what Eben was good at: solving problems, maintaining order, keeping everything running smoothly.

He could do this.

He just needed to stop looking at Noel.

---

The bake-off officially started at two-thirty. Wes rang a small bell—because of course he had a bell—and the bakery erupted into controlled chaos.

Mixers whirred. Ovens preheated. Someone dropped a whisk and it clattered across the floor. The teenager from last year was already three steps ahead of everyone else, moving with the confidence of someone who knew exactly what they were doing.

Eben stationed himself near the back, ready to intervene if anything went wrong.

Noel was up front, charming the crowd. He'd somehow convinced two competitors who'd been glaring at each other over counter space to share, and now they were laughing together like old friends.

Eben watched.

He shouldn't be watching.

He watched anyway.

Noel had a gift for this—for making people feel seen, valued, like they mattered. It wasn't an act. Eben had spent enough time observing to know the difference between performance and genuine care. Noel cared. About everyone. Constantly. It was exhausting just witnessing it.

It was also... something else. Something Eben didn't have a word for.

"He's good at this."

Eben turned. Wes had materialized beside him again. The man moved like a ghost.

"He is," Eben agreed, because there was no point denying it.

"You're good at different things."

"Yes."

"Complementary skills."

Eben gave him a look. Wes smiled.

"Just an observation," Wes said mildly.

"Observe quieter."

Wes's smile widened. He returned to his post behind the counter, leaving Eben alone with his thoughts.

Complementary skills. As if that explained anything. As if working well together was a reason to—

To what?

Kiss in a cramped office and then spend the next twelve hours pretending it hadn't happened?

Eben closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them, Noel was looking at him.

Just for a second. Their gazes caught, held.

Then Noel looked away, and Eben felt the loss of it like a physical thing.

This was getting out of hand.

---

An hour into the competition, things were going well. No fires. No injuries. The postal worker's layer cake was already looking impressive, and the librarian's shortbread smelled like heaven.

Eben allowed himself to relax. Slightly.

That's when Hugh Everhart walked in.

Eben's relaxation died instantly.

Hugh was carrying a large box labeled *DECORATIVE SUPPLIES* in handwriting that looked vaguely threatening. He was also smiling, which was never a good sign.

"Delivery!" Hugh announced cheerfully.

Wes looked up from the counter. His expression shifted—subtle, but Eben caught it. Concern. Maybe resignation.

"Hugh," Wes said carefully. "We didn't order—"

"Extra supplies!" Hugh hoisted the box higher. "Thought you might need them. You know how these things go. Always running out of something."

He started toward the supply table.

Eben moved to intercept, but he was too far away.

Hugh set the box down.

The box tipped.

Everything after that happened very fast and also in slow motion.

The box fell. The contents—which appeared to be several bags of flour, because of course they were—tumbled out. One bag split on impact.

Then another.

Then all of them.

Flour exploded into the air like a small, powdery bomb.

Someone screamed.

The teenager's pie crust collapsed.

A contestant's fondant sculpture—an elaborate swan that had taken an hour to build—toppled sideways and landed in someone else's mixing bowl.

Hugh stood in the center of the destruction, covered head to toe in white powder, looking delighted.

"Oops," he said.

The bakery went silent.

Then Noel started laughing.

Not polite laughter. Real, helpless, uncontrolled laughter that echoed through the flour-hazed air.

Eben looked at him.

Noel was covered in flour. Hair, face, shoulders—everything. He looked ridiculous. He looked—

Beautiful.

The thought arrived uninvited and refused to leave.

Eben became aware that he, too, was covered in flour. He could feel it on his face, in his hair, coating his usually immaculate clothes.

Noel met his eyes across the bakery.

For one long, suspended moment, neither of them moved.

Then Noel grinned—wide, genuine, devastating—and Eben felt something in his chest crack open.

This was definitely a problem.
