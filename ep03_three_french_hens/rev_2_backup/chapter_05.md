# Chapter 5: The Win

**[Dual - Eben]**

They'd succeeded.

Despite Hugh's flour disaster, despite the collapsed pastries and ruined fondant and general chaos, the bake-off had been a success. The contestants had left happy. Wes had looked pleased. The festival had another event checked off the list.

Eben should feel satisfied.

Instead, he felt off-balance.

It was Noel's fault.

Everything lately was Noel's fault, which wasn't fair, but Eben's capacity for fairness had been compromised somewhere around the moment Noel had looked at him in that flour-covered bakery and smiled like Eben had done something remarkable.

He hadn't. He'd just helped someone. It wasn't complicated.

Except Noel had made it feel complicated.

Had made it feel like it *mattered*.

Eben didn't know what to do with that.

They were walking through Tinsel Town's evening streets, snow falling in lazy spirals, neither speaking. The silence should have been comfortable. Professional.

It wasn't.

It was charged. Waiting.

Eben could feel the weight of everything unsaid pressing against his ribs.

"We did it," Noel said suddenly.

Eben glanced over. "We did."

"Despite everything."

"Because of everything," Eben corrected. "The chaos brought people together."

Noel's expression shifted—surprise, then something softer. "That's very optimistic of you."

"I'm not optimistic."

"You just said chaos brought people together. That's practically a motivational poster."

Eben's mouth twitched. "It's an observation."

"A positive observation."

"Don't get used to it."

Noel laughed—quiet, genuine—and Eben felt the sound settle somewhere dangerous in his chest.

This was their first real conversation since the kiss.

It felt monumental and inadequate all at once.

**[Dual - Noel]**

They were talking.

Actually talking, not just coordinating logistics or avoiding eye contact. Talking like two people who might actually like each other.

Noel didn't know what to do with this information.

"You were good today," he said, because apparently he'd decided honesty was the way forward. "With the contestants. With... everything."

Eben's expression shuttered slightly. "So were you."

"I'm always good with people. That's my job."

"It's more than your job."

Noel blinked. "What?"

"You care." Eben said it simply, like it was obvious. "About everyone. Constantly. It's not performance."

Something warm and fragile bloomed in Noel's chest.

"Oh," he managed.

They walked in silence for another moment. The snow was picking up, dusting their shoulders, catching in Eben's dark hair.

Noel wanted to reach out and brush it away.

He didn't.

"Eben—"

"We should talk about it," Eben said at the same time.

They both stopped walking.

Looked at each other.

"The kiss," Eben clarified, even though they both knew exactly what he meant.

Noel's heart was suddenly very loud. "We probably should."

"Probably."

Neither of them talked about it.

The moment stretched, heavy with possibility.

Then Eben's phone rang.

**[Dual - Eben]**

Of course it did.

Eben pulled out his phone, saw the mayor's name, and briefly considered throwing the device into a snowbank.

"I should—"

"Take it," Noel said. "It's fine."

It wasn't fine.

Eben answered. "Frost."

Mayor Kringle's voice was anxious, as always. Something about vendor permits and scheduling conflicts and could Eben please review the updated timeline because she was worried they were falling behind—

"I'll look at it tonight," Eben said, cutting through the spiral. "Send me the file."

"Oh, thank you, I knew I could count on you, you're so reliable—"

Eben ended the call.

Looked at Noel.

Noel was watching him with an expression Eben couldn't quite read.

"Work," Eben said unnecessarily.

"I gathered." Noel's smile was small. "You're very in-demand."

"The mayor is anxious."

"The mayor is always anxious. You're good at managing it."

There it was again. That simple acknowledgment. Like Eben's competence was something worth noticing.

Like *he* was something worth noticing.

Eben didn't know what to do with that either.

---

**[Dual - Noel]**

They started walking again.

The conversation had been interrupted, but something had shifted. The air between them felt different. Less tense. More... open.

Noel took a breath.

"About the kiss," he said.

Eben went very still.

"I don't—" Noel stopped. Started again. "I don't want to pretend it didn't happen."

"Neither do I."

The admission hung between them.

"But I don't know what it means," Noel continued. "Or what you want it to mean. Or if—"

"I don't know either," Eben said quietly.

They looked at each other.

Snow fell around them. The street was empty, the town settling into evening quiet. Somewhere, a church bell chimed six times.

"I should go," Eben said. He didn't move.

"Yeah," Noel agreed. He didn't move either.

The space between them felt impossibly small and impossibly vast all at once.

"Tomorrow," Eben said finally.

"Tomorrow," Noel echoed.

Eben turned to leave.

"Eben."

He stopped. Looked back.

Noel's heart was racing. "I'm glad we're doing this. The festival. Together."

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. "So am I."

Then he walked away, and Noel stood in the falling snow, watching him go.

**[Dual - Eben]**

Eben made it three blocks before he stopped.

Stood on the quiet street, snow falling, hands in his pockets.

He should go home. Review the mayor's timeline. Prepare for tomorrow. Do all the responsible, professional things he was supposed to do.

Instead, he stood there and thought about Noel.

About the way Noel had looked at him in the bakery. About the conversation they'd just had—halting, incomplete, but *real*. About the fact that Eben had almost told him the truth.

*I don't know what this means, but I want to find out.*

He hadn't said it.

But he'd wanted to.

That was dangerous.

Eben had spent years building walls. Keeping people at a distance. Protecting himself from the kind of attachment that destroyed things.

Noel was dismantling those walls without even trying.

Just by being kind. By caring. By looking at Eben like he was someone worth knowing.

Eben closed his eyes.

This was supposed to be temporary.

It didn't feel temporary.

It felt like the start of something.

And that terrified him.

**[Dual - Noel]**

Noel walked home slowly.

His apartment was small, warm, cluttered with the organized chaos of someone who worked too much and slept too little. He dropped his coat on the chair. Made tea he didn't drink. Stood at the window and looked out at the snow.

He kept replaying the conversation.

*I don't want to pretend it didn't happen.*

*Neither do I.*

It wasn't a declaration. It wasn't a plan. It was just... honesty.

And somehow, that felt more significant than anything else.

Noel touched his lips.

He was falling for Eben Frost.

Maybe had already fallen.

That was terrifying and exhilarating and completely inadvisable, and Noel didn't know what to do about it.

Except—

Except maybe he didn't have to do anything. Maybe he could just... let it happen. See where it went. Stop trying to control everything and just *feel*.

The thought was radical.

Also possibly stupid.

But standing in his apartment, alone, thinking about the way Eben had looked at him in the snow—

Noel thought maybe stupid was worth it.

**[Dual - Eben]**

Eben's rental was cold when he got home.

He turned up the heat. Made coffee. Opened his laptop.

His phone buzzed.

**Noel:** *Thanks for today. For helping that kid. For being patient. For... everything.*

**Eben:** *You're welcome.*

**Noel:** *See you tomorrow?*

**Eben:** *Yes.*

He set the phone down.

Tomorrow.

That felt like enough.
