# Chapter 7: First Time

**[Dual]**

The door to Noel's apartment barely closed before they were kissing again.

Desperate. Hungry. Like they'd been holding back for days and finally had permission to stop.

Noel's back hit the wall. Eben's hands were in his hair, on his face, everywhere. Noel kissed back with everything he had, fingers clutching at Eben's jacket, pulling him closer.

This was happening.

This was really happening.

"Bedroom?" Eben asked against his mouth.

"Couch is closer."

"Couch works."

They stumbled across the small apartment, still kissing, hands fumbling with coats and scarves. Noel's coat hit the floor. Eben's followed. They made it to the couch—barely—and Noel pulled Eben down with him.

For a moment, they just looked at each other.

Eben was breathing hard. His hair was mussed from Noel's hands. His eyes were dark, intense, focused entirely on Noel like nothing else in the world mattered.

Noel felt seen.

Completely, utterly seen.

"Hi," he managed.

Eben's mouth curved. Almost a smile. "Hi."

Then he kissed Noel again, and thinking became difficult.

**[Eben]**

This was a terrible idea.

Eben knew it was a terrible idea. He'd known it from the moment Noel had looked at him in Evergreen Square and said *yes* like it was the easiest answer in the world.

He should stop. Should pull back. Should remember all the reasons why attachment was dangerous and temporary was safer and letting himself want this was a mistake.

He didn't stop.

Couldn't stop.

Not when Noel was kissing him like this. Not when Noel's hands were sliding under his shirt, warm against his skin. Not when every touch felt like a confession.

"Eben," Noel breathed.

His name. Just his name. But the way Noel said it—

Eben kissed him harder.

Noel made a sound—soft, wanting—and Eben felt it everywhere.

"Do you want this?" Eben asked, pulling back just enough to meet Noel's eyes.

"Yes."

"Are you sure?"

"I'm sure." Noel's hands framed his face. "I want this. I want you."

The words hit Eben like a physical thing.

"Tell me if you want me to stop," Eben said.

"Please don't stop."

Eben kissed him again. Slower this time. Deliberate. Learning the shape of Noel's mouth, the way he responded to touch, the sounds he made when Eben's hands found sensitive places.

This wasn't just physical.

It couldn't be just physical.

Not when it felt like this.

---

**[Noel]**

Noel had done this before.

Obviously. He wasn't inexperienced. He knew how this worked.

But this—

This felt different.

Eben's hands were careful. Deliberate. Like he was trying to memorize every inch of Noel's skin. Like this mattered.

Like *Noel* mattered.

"Shirt," Noel managed. "Off."

Eben pulled back long enough to tug his shirt over his head.

Noel stared.

He'd known Eben was fit—you couldn't move the way Eben did without being in shape—but seeing it was different. Lean muscle. Pale skin. A few scars Noel wanted to ask about later.

"You're staring," Eben observed.

"You're attractive."

"So are you."

Noel's breath caught.

Eben leaned down, kissed him again. His hands found the hem of Noel's shirt, paused.

"May I?"

The question was soft. Careful.

Consent as foreplay.

"Yes," Noel said.

Eben removed Noel's shirt with the same deliberate care he brought to everything. Then his hands were on Noel's skin, and Noel stopped thinking entirely.

**[Dual]**

They moved together—awkward at first, then finding a rhythm.

Clothes came off in stages. Eben's jeans. Noel's. Hands learning new territory. Mouths following.

"Okay?" Eben asked.

"Yes. More."

"Tell me what you want."

Noel's brain short-circuited. "I—everything. Anything. Just—don't stop."

Eben's expression softened. "I won't."

He kissed Noel's neck. His collarbone. Lower.

Noel's hands fisted in the couch cushions.

This was—

This was—

"Eben," he gasped.

"I'm here."

And he was. Completely present. Completely focused. Like nothing else existed except this moment, this connection, the two of them learning each other.

Noel had never felt so wanted in his life.

---

**[Eben]**

Noel was falling apart beneath him.

Eben could see it—the way his breath came faster, the way his hands clutched at Eben's shoulders, the way he said Eben's name like a prayer.

It was the most beautiful thing Eben had ever seen.

"Look at me," Eben said.

Noel's eyes opened. Met his.

The connection was immediate. Overwhelming.

Eben had meant to keep this simple. Physical. Something they could both walk away from when the festival ended.

But looking into Noel's eyes—seeing the trust there, the vulnerability, the raw honesty—

There was nothing simple about this.

"Eben," Noel whispered.

"I'm here," Eben said again. "I've got you."

He moved with deliberate care. Watching Noel's face. Learning what made him gasp, what made him arch, what made him say Eben's name in that breathless way that made Eben's control fracture.

"Is this okay?" Eben asked.

"Yes. God, yes."

"Tell me if—"

"It's perfect. You're perfect. Don't stop."

Eben kissed him. Poured everything he couldn't say into the kiss.

*I want you.*

**[Noel]**

Noel was drowning.

In sensation. In emotion. In the overwhelming reality of Eben Frost touching him like he was something precious.

"Close," Noel managed. "I'm—"

"Let go," Eben said against his mouth. "I've got you."

Noel believed him.

He let go.

The world went white. Pleasure crashed through him—intense, overwhelming, perfect.

He heard himself say Eben's name. Felt Eben's hands on him, steady and sure. Felt the moment Eben followed him over the edge.

Then they were both breathing hard, tangled together on the couch, and Noel felt like something fundamental had just changed.

---

**[Dual - Aftercare]**

For a long moment, neither of them moved.

Then Eben shifted, carefully extracting himself. Noel made a sound of protest.

"Just—give me a second," Eben said.

He disappeared into what Noel assumed was the bathroom. Returned with a warm cloth.

Noel watched, dazed, as Eben cleaned them both up with the same careful attention he'd brought to everything else.

"You don't have to—"

"I want to," Eben said quietly.

When he was done, he draped Noel's discarded shirt over his shoulders—a small gesture, but it made Noel's chest ache.

"Are you okay?" Eben asked.

Noel looked at him.

Eben was watching him with an expression that was careful and vulnerable all at once. Like he genuinely needed to know the answer.

"I don't know," Noel said honestly.

Eben's expression flickered. "Did I—"

"No. God, no. That was—" Noel stopped. Started again. "That was perfect. I just—I don't know what this means. What we are. What happens next."

Eben was quiet for a moment.

Then he sat beside Noel on the couch. Close, but not quite touching.

"I don't know either," he admitted.

They sat in silence.

The apartment was quiet. Outside, snow was still falling. The world felt very far away.

"I should probably go," Eben said finally.

Noel's chest tightened. "Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

"Unless—" Eben stopped.

"Unless what?"

"Unless you want me to stay."

Noel looked at him. Eben's expression was carefully neutral, but his eyes gave him away.

He wanted to stay.

He was just waiting for permission.

"Stay," Noel said.

"Are you sure?"

"I'm sure."

Something in Eben's expression eased.

"Okay," he said. "I'll stay."
