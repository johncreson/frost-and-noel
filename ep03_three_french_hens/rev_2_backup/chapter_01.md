# Chapter 1: Avoidance Dance

They were going to be professional about this. They were adults. Adults who had done adult things together—specifically kissing-related adult things—and were now pretending it hadn't happened. Very adult behavior.

Noel stared at his ceiling and tried to convince himself this was fine.

It wasn't working.

He'd been awake since four. Not because he'd woken up at four—he hadn't slept. Sleep required not replaying the same thirty seconds of his life on an endless loop, and Noel's brain had apparently decided that was too much to ask.

The kiss.

*The kiss.*

He touched his lips. Again. For probably the hundredth time since last night.

This was pathetic. He was pathetic. He was a grown man lying in bed touching his own mouth like some kind of—

His alarm went off.

Noel slapped it silent and dragged himself upright. His reflection in the bathroom mirror looked how he felt: rumpled, exhausted, and vaguely unhinged. Perfect. Exactly the impression he wanted to make when he saw Eben this morning.

When he saw Eben.

Who he'd kissed.

Who'd kissed him back.

"Stop," Noel told his reflection. His reflection didn't listen. It kept looking at him with those dark-circled eyes that screamed *I made a choice and now I'm thinking about it.*

He showered. Got dressed. Made coffee he didn't drink. Stood in his tiny apartment and tried to figure out how to be normal.

The problem—one of many problems—was that the kiss had been *good*. Not just good. Devastating. The kind of kiss that rewired things. The kind that made a person wonder if maybe all their previous kisses had just been practice for that specific moment in a cramped office that smelled like pine and old wood.

Noel grabbed his coat.

He was going to go to work. He was going to be professional. He was going to act like a competent adult who occasionally kissed his temporary work partner and then moved on with his life like it was no big deal.

Easy.

Merryweather Hall looked the same as always. Twinkling lights. Garland everywhere. The faint smell of cinnamon from whatever Hugh was crafting in the back room. Normal. Familiar.

Noel pushed through the front doors and immediately spotted Eben.

Of course he did. Eben was standing near the main desk, reviewing something on a clipboard, looking completely unbothered. Put-together. Rested. Like he'd slept just fine, thank you, and wasn't currently having an internal crisis about appropriate workplace behavior.

Noel hated him a little bit.

Eben looked up.

Their eyes met.

Noel's brain went blank.

For one horrible, endless second, neither of them moved. Then Eben's gaze flicked away—quick, deliberate—and returned to his clipboard like it contained the secrets of the universe.

Right. Okay. So that's how this was going to go.

Noel crossed to his own workspace on the opposite side of the hall. Far away. A responsible distance for two professionals who were being normal about things.

He pulled out his laptop. Opened his task list. Stared at it without reading a single word.

Across the room, Eben was doing something with vendor contracts. Probably. Noel wasn't watching him. He was absolutely not tracking Eben's movements in his peripheral vision like some kind of obsessive—

Eben shifted. Rolled his shoulders.

Noel looked down at his screen so fast he almost gave himself whiplash.

This was fine. Everything was fine. He just needed to focus. There was work to do. The festival didn't plan itself. He had emails to answer, schedules to confirm, a bake-off happening this afternoon that he definitely hadn't forgotten about until just this second.

The bake-off.

At Candle & Crumb.

Where he and Eben would both need to be.

Together.

Noel closed his eyes.

Professional. He could be professional. He'd been professional his entire career. This was just another event. Another day. The fact that he could still feel the ghost of Eben's mouth on his was irrelevant.

Completely irrelevant.

He opened his eyes and started typing an email. Got three words in before he realized he was typing gibberish. Deleted it. Started again.

Across the hall, Eben's phone rang. Noel heard him answer—low, clipped, efficient. That voice. The same voice that had said Noel's name last night, soft and rough and—

Noel stood up.

He needed air. Or coffee. Or a lobotomy.

He made it halfway to the door before Eben spoke.

"Merrick."

Noel stopped. Turned.

Eben was looking at him now. Really looking. His expression was unreadable—controlled, careful, giving nothing away. But his eyes were doing something complicated.

"The bake-off," Eben said. "This afternoon."

"I know."

"We should coordinate."

"Right. Yes. Coordination. Very important."

A pause. Eben's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

"Two o'clock," he said.

"I'll be there."

Another pause. Longer this time. The air between them felt heavy, loaded with everything they weren't saying.

Then Eben nodded once and returned to his clipboard.

Dismissed.

Noel walked outside into the cold and breathed.

---

He spent the rest of the morning aggressively useful. Confirmed vendor deliveries. Answered seventeen emails. Reorganized the supply closet even though it didn't need reorganizing. Anything to avoid thinking about the fact that in three hours, he'd be in an enclosed space with Eben Frost, pretending everything was normal.

The universe, apparently, thought this was hilarious.

At one-thirty, Noel's phone buzzed.

**Wes Candle:** *Ready for this afternoon? Got everything prepped. Should be fun. 😊*

Noel stared at the smiley face. Wes knew. Somehow, Wes always knew everything. It was unnerving.

**Noel:** *Ready. See you at two.*

**Wes:** *Both of you?*

Noel's thumb hovered over the keyboard.

**Noel:** *Yes. Both of us.*

**Wes:** *Good. 😊*

That second smiley face felt pointed.

Noel pocketed his phone and checked the time. One forty-five. He should head over. Get there early. Establish himself in the space before Eben arrived so he wouldn't have to do the awkward "oh hello we're both here now" thing.

Solid plan.

He grabbed his coat and turned toward the door.

Eben was already standing there, pulling on his gloves.

Of course he was.

"Ready?" Eben asked.

His voice was neutral. Professional. Like last night had happened to two completely different people.

Noel managed a smile. "Ready."

They walked to Candle & Crumb together.

Neither of them said a word.

---

The bakery smelled like sugar and cinnamon and something else Noel couldn't identify—maybe optimism, maybe impending disaster. The line between the two was thinner than people thought.

Wes was behind the counter, setting out mixing bowls with the kind of precision that suggested he'd done this before. Which he had. Multiple times. The annual bake-off was a Tinsel Town institution, and Wes ran it like a general commanding troops.

He looked up when they entered. His smile was warm and knowing and made Noel want to sink into the floor.

"There you are," Wes said. "Both of you. Together."

"We work together," Noel said quickly. "So. Yes. Together. Professionally."

Eben said nothing. He was studying the bakery layout like it might contain traps.

Wes's smile didn't waver. "Contestants should start arriving soon. Noel, you're handling check-in. Eben, you're on logistics—making sure everyone has what they need, no fights over oven space, that sort of thing."

"Understood," Eben said.

"Great." Wes's gaze flicked between them, assessing. "This should be fun."

The way he said *fun* suggested he had a very different definition of the word than most people.

Noel busied himself setting up the check-in table. Clipboard. Name tags. Pens. Simple tasks. Manageable tasks. Tasks that didn't require thinking about the fact that Eben was ten feet away, moving through the space with that quiet competence that was—

Stop.

Focus.

The first contestants arrived. Noel smiled, checked names, handed out aprons. Fell into the familiar rhythm of being helpful. This, at least, he knew how to do.

Eben worked the room with the same controlled efficiency he brought to everything. Directing people to stations. Answering questions. Not smiling, but not unfriendly either. Just... Eben.

They didn't look at each other.

They were very, very good at not looking at each other.

Right up until the moment their paths crossed near the supply table and Noel reached for the same bag of flour as Eben and their hands touched.

It lasted half a second.

Noel pulled back like he'd been burned.

Eben's expression didn't change, but something flickered in his eyes—quick, unguarded, gone before Noel could name it.

"Sorry," Noel said.

"It's fine."

It wasn't fine. Nothing about this was fine.

Noel grabbed a different bag of flour and retreated to the other side of the bakery.

This was going to be a very long afternoon.
