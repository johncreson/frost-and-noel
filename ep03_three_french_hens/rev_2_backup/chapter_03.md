# Chapter 3: Flour Chaos

**[Noel]**

The bakery looked like a snow globe had exploded.

Everything was white. The floor, the counters, the contestants—everyone and everything coated in a fine layer of flour that hung in the air like fog.

Hugh stood in the epicenter, somehow managing to look both apologetic and pleased with himself.

"Well," he said brightly. "That's one way to add atmosphere."

Wes closed his eyes. "Everyone's fired."

He didn't mean it. Probably. Wes had the patience of a saint, which was good, because Hugh tested it approximately once a week.

Noel tried to stop laughing. Failed. Tried again.

"I'm sorry," he managed, wiping his eyes and immediately regretting it when flour dust made everything worse. "I'm sorry, this isn't funny—"

"It's a little funny," the teenager said. She was staring at the ruins of her pie crust with the resignation of someone who'd seen worse.

"It's not funny," the woman whose fondant swan had died said. Then she looked at the swan—now a shapeless blob in someone else's batter—and snorted. "Okay, it's a little funny."

The tension broke.

People started laughing. Brushing flour off themselves and each other. Assessing the damage with the kind of good humor that only came from shared disaster.

Noel looked around for Eben.

Found him immediately, because apparently Noel's brain had installed some kind of Eben-tracking system without permission.

Eben was covered in flour. Completely covered. It was in his dark hair, on his face, coating his usually pristine jacket. He looked... rumpled. Human. Approachable.

He looked at Noel.

Noel's laughter died in his throat.

They were both ridiculous. Standing in a flour-bombed bakery, covered in white powder, surrounded by chaos. It should have been absurd.

It didn't feel absurd.

It felt like something else entirely.

Eben's expression shifted—something unguarded flickering across his face before he locked it down again.

Then he did something Noel had never seen before.

He almost smiled.

Not quite. Just the barest hint of it, gone so fast Noel might have imagined it. But it had been there. Real. Devastating.

Noel's heart did something complicated in his chest.

"Right," Wes said, breaking the moment. "Let's assess the damage."

**[Eben]**

The damage was extensive but not catastrophic.

Three contestants needed to start over completely. Five could salvage their work with modifications. Four were miraculously unaffected, having been far enough from the blast radius to escape.

Hugh was banished to the corner with a broom and a look from Wes that could have frozen lava.

Eben helped coordinate the cleanup. Distributed fresh ingredients. Adjusted timers to account for the delay. Fell back into the familiar rhythm of problem-solving.

It helped. Slightly.

What didn't help was Noel working beside him, still covered in flour, still smiling like the disaster had been the best thing to happen all day.

"You have flour in your hair," Noel said.

Eben resisted the urge to check. "You have flour on your face."

"We both look ridiculous."

"Yes."

A pause. Noel's smile widened.

"Why are you smiling?" Eben asked before he could stop himself.

"I'm not. That's the flour."

It wasn't the flour.

Eben turned back to the supply inventory before he could do something inadvisable. Like smile back.

**[Noel]**

The bake-off resumed with the kind of determined energy that came from refusing to let chaos win.

Noel made his rounds, checking on contestants, offering encouragement. The postal worker's layer cake had survived intact. The librarian's shortbread was already in the oven, filling the air with butter and sugar. Even the teenager had managed to salvage her pie crust, though she'd had to start the lattice work over from scratch.

"You're good at this," someone said.

Noel turned. One of the first-time bakers—a young man who'd been on the verge of tears when his mixing bowl had been flour-bombed—was watching him with something like gratitude.

"At what?" Noel asked.

"Making it feel okay. When things go wrong."

Noel blinked. "Oh. I—thank you?"

The man smiled and returned to his station.

Noel stood there, caught off-guard by the simple kindness of it.

He was used to being useful. Used to fixing things, smoothing things over, making sure everyone else was okay. He wasn't used to people noticing. Or if they noticed, they didn't usually say anything.

It felt... nice.

He glanced across the bakery. Eben was crouched beside a nervous-looking older woman, talking her through something with her dough. His voice was too low to hear, but his posture was patient. Calm.

The woman nodded, tried whatever he'd suggested, and her face lit up when it worked.

Eben stood, brushed flour off his knees, and moved to the next person who needed help.

He didn't make a show of it. Didn't draw attention to himself. Just quietly, efficiently made sure everyone had what they needed.

Noel's chest did that complicated thing again.

*Great. Perfect. Emotionally unavailable glacier man was also secretly kind. This was fine. He was fine.*

He was absolutely not fine.

**[Eben]**

The older woman—Mrs. Chen, according to her name tag—had been on the verge of giving up.

Her pie dough had been too dry, crumbling apart every time she tried to roll it. The flour explosion had only made things worse, and she'd been standing at her station with the kind of defeated slump that Eben recognized.

He'd seen it before. In himself, years ago, when everything had fallen apart and he'd had to rebuild from nothing.

So he'd stopped. Crouched beside her. Talked her through adding water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough came together.

"There," he'd said when she'd successfully rolled it out. "Perfect."

She'd smiled at him—warm, grateful—and Eben had felt something unfamiliar stir in his chest.

He'd forgotten what it felt like to help someone without expecting anything in return.

He stood, brushed off his knees, and turned.

Noel was watching him from across the bakery.

Eben froze.

Noel's expression was... soft. Open. Like he'd just seen something that mattered.

Their eyes held for one beat too long.

Then Noel looked away, and Eben forced himself to move to the next station.

But he could still feel the weight of that gaze.

Could still feel the way something had shifted between them in that moment.

This was getting dangerous.

**[Noel]**

By four o'clock, the bake-off was back on track.

The kitchen smelled incredible—sugar and chocolate and cinnamon and butter, all mixing together into something that made Noel's stomach growl. He hadn't eaten since breakfast. Hadn't even thought about food, too busy managing chaos and trying not to stare at Eben.

The contestants were in the final stretch now. Decorating, plating, adding finishing touches. The teenager's pie looked like something from a magazine. The postal worker's layer cake was a work of art. Even Mrs. Chen's pie—the one that had almost failed—was golden and perfect.

Wes moved through the space with quiet authority, checking progress, offering gentle suggestions. He caught Noel's eye and nodded toward the back room.

Noel followed.

"You did well," Wes said once they were alone.

"Hugh caused a flour explosion."

"And you kept everyone calm." Wes's smile was knowing. "That's a skill."

"I just—" Noel shrugged. "I don't know. Tried to help."

"You did more than that." Wes studied him for a moment. "You made people feel like it was okay to fail. That's rare."

Noel didn't know what to say to that.

Wes's expression softened. "You're allowed to accept a compliment, you know."

"I know."

"Do you?"

Before Noel could answer, a timer went off in the main room. Wes patted his shoulder and headed back out.

Noel stayed in the back room for another moment, trying to process.

He was good at this. At helping. At making people feel okay.

But was that enough?

Was being useful the same as being wanted?

He didn't know.

He was afraid to find out.

**[Dual]**

The bake-off ended at five.

Wes rang his bell—two cheerful chimes—and the contestants stepped back from their creations with the exhausted satisfaction of people who'd survived something.

The judging was quick. Wes, Noel, and Eben sampled everything, took notes, conferred quietly.

The teenager won. Again. Her pie was perfect—flaky crust, spiced filling, lattice work that looked like lace.

She accepted her ribbon with a grin that suggested she'd known all along.

The postal worker came in second. Mrs. Chen got an honorable mention for "most improved under pressure," which made her tear up.

Hugh was not allowed to participate in judging. He was still in the corner with his broom, looking appropriately chastened.

As the contestants packed up and filtered out, Noel and Eben found themselves standing side by side near the counter.

"We did it," Noel said.

"We did."

Their first real conversation since the kiss.

It felt monumental and inadequate all at once.

"Despite the flour," Noel added.

"Because of the flour," Eben corrected. "It brought people together."

Noel looked at him. Eben's expression was dry, but there was something in his eyes—something almost playful.

Was that a joke?

Had Eben Frost just made a joke?

Noel felt his smile grow. "Did you just—"

"No."

"You did. You made a joke."

"I stated a fact."

"A funny fact."

Eben's mouth twitched. "If you say so."

They stood there, covered in flour, surrounded by the warm smell of baking and the quiet satisfaction of a job well done.

Something was waiting between them. Something that had started in a tiny office and was now demanding attention.

Noel took a breath.

"Eben—"

"Get home safe, you two," Wes called from behind the counter.

The way he said *you two* made it sound like a single unit.

Noel's words died.

Eben's jaw tightened.

They walked out into the cold together, and neither of them said what they were both thinking.
