# DEVELOPMENTAL EDIT: Episode 3 — Three French Hens

## Overall Assessment

**Verdict:** Solid "first time" episode with good tension build, but ending falls into the same over-affirmation pattern we fixed in EP1-2.

**Grade: B**

---

## PASS 1: STRUCTURAL

### What's Working ✅

| Element | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| Cold open | Excellent. Picks up immediately after kiss, no re-explaining |
| Avoidance dance | Effective tension in Ch1-3, earned payoff |
| First time scene | Appropriately staged, consent is clear, heat level matches series |
| Morning after | Emotionally grounded, sets up EP4 conflict |

### What Needs Work ⚠️

#### 1. Chapter 8 Ending (CRITICAL)
Same stacked-endings problem as EP1-2. After line 385, you have 5+ semi-endings:
- "That felt like enough" (line 385)
- "This was terrifying and complicated..." (line 369)
- "Wanted *him* anyway" (line 371)
- "Let himself stay" (line 383)
- "Tomorrow, he'd figure out..." (line 377)

**Fix:** End on ONE of these. Recommend line 373: "That was the most frightening realization of all."

#### 2. "I don't know" Pattern
You use "I don't know" as an emotional beat **11 times** across the episode:
- Ch1: 2x
- Ch6: 3x  
- Ch7: 2x
- Ch8: 4x

This is stalling. Pick your 3 best uses. Cut the rest.

## PASS 2: REPETITION AUDIT

### Thematic Words (Count)

| Word | Count | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| Temporary | 8 | ≤5 |
| Stay/Stayed | 14 | ≤8 |
| Want/Wanted | 23 | ≤15 |
| I don't know | 11 | ≤4 |

### Pattern: "Something in [body part] did something complicated"
Used 5x. Cut to 2x max.

### Pattern: Lists after realizations
Ch8 lines 361-366 is a list that reinforces without adding:
```
This was supposed to be temporary.
This was supposed to be simple.
This was supposed to be safe.
```
**Fix:** Keep ONE. Delete the other two.

## PASS 3: SCENE-LEVEL NOTES

### Chapter 1: Avoidance Dance ✅
**Strong.** Good opening hook. The flour-bag touch is effective. One trim:
- Line 33-34: "The kind of kiss that rewired things" is explained again 3 lines later. Cut one.

### Chapter 2-5: Building Tension
**Adequate.** The bake-off is doing good work. Wes is correctly positioned (not over-explaining).

Mid-episode could use ONE more beat of Eben perspective to balance Noel's anxiety.

### Chapter 6: The Walk ✅
**Good scene.** The "attachment destroys things" confession is placed correctly.

One cut:
- Lines 191-201 have 6 ending statements. Pick best 2.

### Chapter 7: First Time ✅
**Well-executed.** Consent beats are present without being clinical. Dual POV works.

One trim:
- The interpretation pass after "Noel felt like something fundamental had just changed" (line 227) is the meaning paragraph. Let it live in Ch8 instead.

### Chapter 8: Afterglow ⚠️
**Needs work.** Good bones, but over-explains the emotional shift.

#### Specific cuts needed:

| Lines | Issue | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 36-41 | "This meant something / *He* meant something" | Cut — already shown |
| 89-96 | 7 lines explaining "temporary feels wrong" | Keep 2 |
| 361-366 | Triple "supposed to be" | Keep 1 |
| 383-385 | Final stacked endings | End at 373 |

## HOOK ENDING FIX

### Current ending (lines 375-385):
```
Eben closed his eyes.

Tomorrow, he'd figure out what to do about this.

Tonight, he'd just... let himself have it.

Let himself want.

Let himself stay.

That felt like enough.
```

### Recommended ending (cut at line 373):
```
It was terrifying and complicated and dangerous, and Eben wanted it anyway.

Wanted *him* anyway.

That was the most frightening realization of all.
```

This is cleaner, meaner, and trusts the reader.

## WORD COUNT NOTE

Current: 11,927 words (longest episode so far)

After cuts: ~11,400 words (still within healthy range)

## CONTINUITY CHECK

| Element | EP2 Setup | EP3 Follow-through |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Kiss aftermath | ✅ | ✅ Addressed immediately |
| "Temporary" tension | ✅ | ✅ Maintained |
| Eben staying overnight | — | ✅ First occurrence |
| Town awareness | ✅ Wes knows | ⚠️ Could use one more townsperson noticing |

---

## SUMMARY: Priority Fixes

1. **Ch8 ending** — Cut to line 373
2. **"I don't know"** — Reduce from 11 to 4
3. **Stay/want density** — Reduce each by 30%
4. **Triple-lists** — Cut to singles

**After these fixes: Grade A-**
