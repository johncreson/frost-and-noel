# **Chapter 1**

The kiss had been a mistake.

Obviously.

Eben had spent the entire night cataloging the reasons why. The list was extensive. Well-organized. Convincing.

None of it mattered, because he could still feel Noel's mouth on his.

This was a problem.

Eben adjusted the oven temperature for station three and tried to focus. The bake-off was simple: twelve contestants, three hours, minimal supervision required. He'd handled more complicated logistics in his sleep. This should be easy.

It wasn't easy.

Noel was across the bakery, laughing at something a contestant said. Bright, genuine laughter that made his whole face change. Eben had noticed this approximately forty-seven times in the past hour and was beginning to suspect he had a problem that went beyond poor decision-making.

"Interesting day yesterday?"

Eben didn't jump. He had more self-control than that. But it was close.

Wes was beside him, wiping down the counter with a cloth that didn't need wiping. His expression was mild. Friendly. Deeply suspicious.

"Standard," Eben said.

"Mmm."

That was it. Just mmm. But the sound contained multitudes. Wes had a gift for packing entire conversations into single syllables.

Eben hated it.

"The bake-off should run smoothly," Eben said, because redirecting was a valid strategy. "You've prepared well."

"I always do." Wes folded the cloth with unnecessary precision. "Though preparation only goes so far when people are... distracted."

Eben's jaw tightened. "I'm not distracted."

"Of course not." Wes's smile was gentle. Infuriating. "Neither is Noel, I'm sure. He's been very focused. Haven't seen him look your way once."

Eben said nothing. Across the bakery, Noel was helping an elderly woman tie her apron. His hands were careful. Patient.

Eben looked away.

"Right," Wes said softly. "Not distracted at all."

He drifted off to greet new arrivals, leaving Eben standing alone near the ovens, feeling like he'd just failed a test he hadn't known he was taking.

The contestants were a mix of Tinsel Town regulars and a few brave souls from neighboring areas. Eben recognized most of them: the librarian who made exceptional shortbread, the postal worker with a fondness for elaborate layer cakes, the teenager who'd won last year with a pie that had made grown adults weep.

They were cheerful. Excited. Completely unaware that Eben was having a minor crisis in the corner.

He forced himself to focus. Checked that each station had the required equipment. Confirmed oven schedules. Answered questions about ingredient substitutions with the kind of patience that came from years of managing other people's chaos.

This was fine. He was fine.

Then Noel laughed again—that same unguarded sound—and Eben's concentration shattered.

This was not fine.

The kiss had been a lapse in judgment. A momentary weakness caused by exhaustion and proximity and the way Noel had looked at him in that tiny office, like Eben was something worth wanting. That wasn't a reason. That was an excuse.

Eben didn't do excuses.

He also didn't do whatever this was: standing in a bakery pretending to review a supply list while actually tracking Noel's location like his life depended on it.

"Mr. Frost?"

Eben blinked. One of the contestants—a nervous young man with flour already on his shirt—was hovering nearby.

"Yes?"

"I can't find the vanilla extract."

Eben located it in under ten seconds. The man thanked him profusely and scurried back to his station.

Simple. Manageable. This was what Eben was good at: solving problems, maintaining order, keeping everything running smoothly.

He could do this.

He just needed to stop looking at Noel.

The bake-off officially started at two-thirty. Wes rang a small bell—because of course he had a bell—and the bakery erupted into controlled chaos.

Mixers whirred. Ovens preheated. Someone dropped a whisk and it clattered across the floor. The teenager from last year was already three steps ahead of everyone else, moving with the confidence of someone who knew exactly what they were doing.

Eben stationed himself near the back, ready to intervene if anything went wrong.

Noel was up front, charming the crowd. He'd somehow convinced two competitors who'd been glaring at each other over counter space to share, and now they were laughing together like old friends.

Eben watched.

He shouldn't be watching.

He watched anyway.

Noel had a gift for this—for making people feel seen, valued, like they mattered. It wasn't an act. Eben had spent enough time observing to know the difference between performance and genuine care. Noel cared. About everyone. Constantly. It was exhausting just witnessing it.

It was also... something else. Something Eben didn't have a word for.

"He's good at this."

Eben turned. Wes had materialized beside him again. The man moved like a ghost.

"He is," Eben agreed, because there was no point denying it.

"You're good at different things."

"Yes."

"Complementary skills."

Eben gave him a look. Wes smiled.

"Just an observation," Wes said mildly.

"Observe quieter."

Wes's smile widened. He returned to his post behind the counter, leaving Eben alone with his thoughts.

Complementary skills. As if that explained anything. As if working well together was a reason to—

To what?

Kiss in a cramped office and then spend the next twelve hours pretending it hadn't happened?

Eben closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them, Noel was looking at him.

Just for a second. Their gazes caught, held.

Then Noel looked away, and Eben felt the loss of it like a physical thing.

This was getting out of hand.

An hour into the competition, things were going well. No fires. No injuries. The postal worker's layer cake was already looking impressive, and the librarian's shortbread smelled like heaven.

Eben allowed himself to relax. Slightly.

That's when Hugh Everhart walked in.

Eben's relaxation died instantly.

Hugh was carrying a large box labeled DECORATIVE SUPPLIES in handwriting that looked vaguely threatening. He was also smiling, which was never a good sign.

"Delivery\!" Hugh announced cheerfully.

Wes looked up from the counter. His expression shifted—subtle, but Eben caught it. Concern. Maybe resignation.

"Hugh," Wes said carefully. "We didn't order—"

"Extra supplies\!" Hugh hoisted the box higher. "Thought you might need them. You know how these things go. Always running out of something."

He started toward the supply table.

Eben moved to intercept, but he was too far away.

Hugh set the box down.

The box tipped.

Everything after that happened very fast and also in slow motion.

The box fell. The contents—which appeared to be several bags of flour, because of course they were—tumbled out. One bag split on impact.

Then another.

Then all of them.

Flour exploded into the air like a small, powdery bomb.

Someone screamed.

The teenager's pie crust collapsed.

A contestant's fondant sculpture—an elaborate swan that had taken an hour to build—toppled sideways and landed in someone else's mixing bowl.

Hugh stood in the center of the destruction, covered head to toe in white powder, looking delighted.

"Oops," he said.

The bakery went silent.

Then Noel started laughing.

Not polite laughter. Real, helpless, uncontrolled laughter that echoed through the flour-hazed air.

Eben looked at him.

Noel was covered in flour. Hair, face, shoulders—everything. He looked ridiculous. He looked—

Beautiful.

The thought arrived uninvited and refused to leave.

Eben became aware that he, too, was covered in flour. He could feel it on his face, in his hair, coating his usually immaculate clothes.

Noel met his eyes across the bakery.

For one long, suspended moment, neither of them moved.

Then Noel grinned—wide, genuine, devastating—and Eben felt something in his chest crack open.

This was definitely a problem.

# **Chapter 2**

## *Noel*

The bakery looked like a snow globe had exploded.

Everything was white. The floor, the counters, the contestants—everyone and everything coated in a fine layer of flour that hung in the air like fog.

Hugh stood in the epicenter, somehow managing to look both apologetic and pleased with himself.

"Well," he said brightly. "That's one way to add atmosphere."

Wes closed his eyes. "Everyone's fired."

He didn't mean it. Probably. Wes had the patience of a saint, which was good, because Hugh tested it approximately once a week.

Noel tried to stop laughing. Failed. Tried again.

"I'm sorry," he managed, wiping his eyes and immediately regretting it when flour dust made everything worse. "I'm sorry, this isn't funny—"

"It's a little funny," the teenager said. She was staring at the ruins of her pie crust with the resignation of someone who'd seen worse.

"It's not funny," the woman whose fondant swan had died said. Then she looked at the swan—now a shapeless blob in someone else's batter—and snorted. "Okay, it's a little funny."

The tension broke.

People started laughing. Brushing flour off themselves and each other. Assessing the damage with the kind of good humor that only came from shared disaster.

Noel looked around for Eben.

Found him immediately, because apparently Noel's brain had installed some kind of Eben-tracking system without permission.

Eben was covered in flour. Completely covered. It was in his dark hair, on his face, coating his usually pristine jacket. He looked... rumpled. Human. Approachable.

He looked at Noel.

Noel's laughter died in his throat.

They were both ridiculous. Standing in a flour-bombed bakery, covered in white powder, surrounded by chaos. It should have been absurd.

It didn't feel absurd.

It felt like something else entirely.

Eben's expression shifted—something unguarded flickering across his face before he locked it down again.

Then he did something Noel had never seen before.

He almost smiled.

Not quite. Just the barest hint of it, gone so fast Noel might have imagined it. But it had been there. Real. Devastating.

Noel's heart did something complicated in his chest.

"Right," Wes said, breaking the moment. "Let's assess the damage."

## *Eben*

The damage was extensive but not catastrophic.

Three contestants needed to start over completely. Five could salvage their work with modifications. Four were miraculously unaffected, having been far enough from the blast radius to escape.

Hugh was banished to the corner with a broom and a look from Wes that could have frozen lava.

Eben helped coordinate the cleanup. Distributed fresh ingredients. Adjusted timers to account for the delay. Fell back into the familiar rhythm of problem-solving.

It helped. Slightly.

What didn't help was Noel working beside him, still covered in flour, still smiling like the disaster had been the best thing to happen all day.

"You have flour in your hair," Noel said.

Eben resisted the urge to check. "You have flour on your face."

"We both look ridiculous."

"Yes."

A pause. Noel's smile widened.

"Why are you smiling?" Eben asked before he could stop himself.

"I'm not. That's the flour."

It wasn't the flour.

Eben turned back to the supply inventory before he could do something inadvisable. Like smile back.

## *Noel*

The bake-off resumed with the kind of determined energy that came from refusing to let chaos win.

Noel made his rounds, checking on contestants, offering encouragement. The postal worker's layer cake had survived intact. The librarian's shortbread was already in the oven, filling the air with butter and sugar. Even the teenager had managed to salvage her pie crust, though she'd had to start the lattice work over from scratch.

"You're good at this," someone said.

Noel turned. One of the first-time bakers—a young man who'd been on the verge of tears when his mixing bowl had been flour-bombed—was watching him with something like gratitude.

"At what?" Noel asked.

"Making it feel okay. When things go wrong."

Noel blinked. "Oh. I—thank you?"

The man smiled and returned to his station.

Noel stood there, caught off-guard by the simple kindness of it.

He was used to being useful. Used to fixing things, smoothing things over, making sure everyone else was okay. He wasn't used to people noticing. Or if they noticed, they didn't usually say anything.

It felt... nice.

He glanced across the bakery. Eben was crouched beside a nervous-looking older woman, talking her through something with her dough. His voice was too low to hear, but his posture was patient. Calm.

The woman nodded, tried whatever he'd suggested, and her face lit up when it worked.

Eben stood, brushed flour off his knees, and moved to the next person who needed help.

He didn't make a show of it. Didn't draw attention to himself. Just quietly, efficiently made sure everyone had what they needed.

Noel's chest did that complicated thing again.

Great. Perfect. Emotionally unavailable glacier man was also secretly kind. This was fine. He was fine.

He was absolutely not fine.

## *Eben*

The older woman—Mrs. Chen, according to her name tag—had been on the verge of giving up.

Her pie dough had been too dry, crumbling apart every time she tried to roll it. The flour explosion had only made things worse, and she'd been standing at her station with the kind of defeated slump that Eben recognized.

He'd seen it before. In himself, years ago, when everything had fallen apart and he'd had to rebuild from nothing.

So he'd stopped. Crouched beside her. Talked her through adding water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough came together.

"There," he'd said when she'd successfully rolled it out. "Perfect."

She'd smiled at him—warm, grateful—and Eben had felt something unfamiliar stir in his chest.

He'd forgotten what it felt like to help someone without expecting anything in return.

He stood, brushed off his knees, and turned.

Noel was watching him from across the bakery.

Eben froze.

Noel's expression was... soft. Open. Like he'd just seen something that mattered.

Their eyes held for one beat too long.

Then Noel looked away, and Eben forced himself to move to the next station.

But he could still feel the weight of that gaze.

Could still feel the way something had shifted between them in that moment.

This was getting dangerous.

## *Noel*

By four o'clock, the bake-off was back on track.

The kitchen smelled incredible—sugar and chocolate and cinnamon and butter, all mixing together into something that made Noel's stomach growl. He hadn't eaten since breakfast. Hadn't even thought about food, too busy managing chaos and trying not to stare at Eben.

The contestants were in the final stretch now. Decorating, plating, adding finishing touches. The teenager's pie looked like something from a magazine. The postal worker's layer cake was a work of art. Even Mrs. Chen's pie—the one that had almost failed—was golden and perfect.

Wes moved through the space with quiet authority, checking progress, offering gentle suggestions. He caught Noel's eye and nodded toward the back room.

Noel followed.

"You did well," Wes said once they were alone.

"Hugh caused a flour explosion."

"And you kept everyone calm." Wes's smile was knowing. "That's a skill."

"I just—" Noel shrugged. "I don't know. Tried to help."

"You did more than that." Wes studied him for a moment. "You made people feel like it was okay to fail. That's rare."

Noel didn't know what to say to that.

Wes's expression softened. "You're allowed to accept a compliment, you know."

"I know."

"Do you?"

Before Noel could answer, a timer went off in the main room. Wes patted his shoulder and headed back out.

Noel stayed in the back room for another moment, trying to process.

He was good at this. At helping. At making people feel okay.

But was that enough?

Was being useful the same as being wanted?

He didn't know.

He was afraid to find out.

The bake-off ended at five.

Wes rang his bell—two cheerful chimes—and the contestants stepped back from their creations with the exhausted satisfaction of people who'd survived something.

The judging was quick. Wes, Noel, and Eben sampled everything, took notes, conferred quietly.

The teenager won. Again. Her pie was perfect—flaky crust, spiced filling, lattice work that looked like lace.

She accepted her ribbon with a grin that suggested she'd known all along.

The postal worker came in second. Mrs. Chen got an honorable mention for "most improved under pressure," which made her tear up.

Hugh was not allowed to participate in judging. He was still in the corner with his broom, looking appropriately chastened.

As the contestants packed up and filtered out, Noel and Eben found themselves standing side by side near the counter.

"We did it," Noel said.

"We did."

Their first real conversation since the kiss.

It felt monumental and inadequate all at once.

"Despite the flour," Noel added.

"Because of the flour," Eben corrected. "It brought people together."

Noel looked at him. Eben's expression was dry, but there was something in his eyes—something almost playful.

Was that a joke?

Had Eben Frost just made a joke?

Noel felt his smile grow. "Did you just—"

"No."

"You did. You made a joke."

"I stated a fact."

"A funny fact."

Eben's mouth twitched. "If you say so."

They stood there, covered in flour, surrounded by the warm smell of baking and the quiet satisfaction of a job well done.

Something was waiting between them. Something that had started in a tiny office and was now demanding attention.

Noel took a breath.

"Eben—"

"Get home safe, you two," Wes called from behind the counter.

The way he said you two made it sound like a single unit.

Noel's words died.

Eben's jaw tightened.

They walked out into the cold together, and neither of them said what they were both thinking.

# **Chapter 3**

The back room of Candle & Crumb was quieter than the main bakery.

Noel had ducked in to grab more napkins—or that's what he'd told himself. Really, he'd needed a moment. A breath. Space to think about the fact that he and Eben had just had an almost-normal conversation and Noel's entire nervous system was still processing it.

He found the napkins. Stood there holding them like they might contain answers.

They didn't.

Through the partially open door, he could hear the bakery winding down. Contestants chatting, packing up their things. Wes's calm voice directing cleanup. The comfortable sounds of an event ending well.

Then he heard something else.

A younger voice, shaky. On the edge of tears.

"I can't— It's not working. I don't know what I'm doing wrong."

Noel moved closer to the door.

In the main room, one of the contestants—the nervous young man from earlier—was standing at his station, staring at a collapsed pastry with the kind of despair usually reserved for actual tragedies.

Eben was there.

Noel watched as Eben set down whatever he'd been carrying and moved to the young man's side. Not hovering. Just... present.

"What happened?" Eben asked. His voice was different. Softer than Noel had ever heard it.

"I don't know." The young man's hands were shaking. "I followed the recipe exactly, but it just—it fell apart. Everything I make falls apart."

There was more than pastry failure in those words.

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then he crouched down—actually crouched—so he was at eye level with the ruined dessert.

"Show me what you did," he said.

The young man walked him through it. Eben listened. Didn't interrupt. Didn't judge. Just listened with the kind of attention that made it clear he actually cared about the answer.

"There," Eben said when the explanation finished. "You over-mixed. See how the batter's dense? That's gluten development. For this recipe, you want to fold, not stir."

"I don't know how to fold."

"I'll show you."

And he did.

Noel stood in the doorway, frozen, as Eben Frost—controlled, distant, emotionally unavailable Eben Frost—patiently walked a stranger through the mechanics of folding batter. His hands moved with careful precision, demonstrating the motion. His voice stayed gentle, encouraging.

"Like this. See? Light touch. You're not forcing it. You're coaxing it."

The young man tried. Failed. Tried again.

"Better," Eben said. "Keep going."

Three attempts later, the batter came together properly. The young man stared at it like it had performed a miracle.

"I did it."

"You did."

"I actually—" The young man's voice cracked. "Thank you. I know it's just baking, but—"

"It's not just baking," Eben said quietly. "It's proof that you can learn. That you can try something difficult and succeed. That matters."

The young man nodded, blinking rapidly.

Eben stood, brushed flour off his knees, and rested a hand briefly on the young man's shoulder. "You'll be fine."

Then he moved away, back to whatever task he'd been doing before, like he hadn't just completely rewired Noel's understanding of who he was.

Noel stood in the doorway, napkins forgotten, heart doing acrobatics.

Oh no.

This was bad.

This was very bad.

Noel had been managing, barely, when Eben was just attractive and competent and occasionally almost-funny. He could handle that. He could keep it professional, keep it temporary, keep it from meaning anything.

But this?

Eben being kind—genuinely, quietly kind, in a way that expected nothing in return?

Noel's defenses didn't stand a chance.

He forced himself to move. Walked back into the main bakery with the napkins, set them on the counter, tried to look normal.

Eben glanced up. Their eyes met.

Noel looked away so fast he nearly gave himself whiplash.

Professional. Be professional. Do not think about the way he crouched down to help that kid. Do not think about his voice going soft. Do not—

"Noel?"

Wes was beside him, looking concerned.

"You okay? You look a little..."

"Fine," Noel said automatically. "I'm fine."

Wes's expression suggested he didn't believe that for a second, but he didn't push. Just handed Noel a cup of water and moved on.

Noel drank it. Tried to think.

This was temporary. The partnership, the festival, whatever was happening between them—all of it was temporary. Eben would leave after Christmas. Noel would stay. That was the plan.

That had always been the plan.

So it didn't matter that Eben was kind. It didn't matter that he'd helped a stranger with the same careful attention he brought to everything. It didn't matter that Noel had just witnessed something that made his chest ache.

None of it mattered.

Noel repeated this to himself several times.

His heart didn't listen.

The bakery emptied slowly.

Contestants left with their creations—winners and losers alike, all smiling, all covered in varying amounts of flour. Hugh finished sweeping and escaped before Wes could assign him additional penance. The young man Eben had helped waved goodbye with something like hope on his face.

Soon it was just Noel, Eben, and Wes.

"You two did well today," Wes said, wiping down the counter. "Despite the chaos."

"Hugh's chaos," Noel corrected.

"Hugh's chaos," Wes agreed. "But you handled it. Both of you."

He said it casually, but there was weight behind the words. Acknowledgment. Approval.

Noel felt something warm settle in his chest.

"We should go," Eben said. He was pulling on his coat, careful and methodical. "Let you close up."

"I'm in no rush." Wes's smile was knowing. "But yes, you should probably go. Together, ideally."

There it was again. That pointed emphasis.

Noel shot him a look. Wes's smile didn't waver.

"Come on," Eben said quietly.

Noel followed him out into the cold.

The sun was setting. The sky had gone pink and gold, the kind of winter sunset that made everything look softer. Snow was starting to fall—light, lazy flakes that caught the streetlights.

Tinsel Town was beautiful like this. Quiet. Peaceful.

Noel couldn't appreciate any of it.

He was too busy being hyperaware of Eben walking beside him. Close enough that their shoulders almost brushed. Far enough that they weren't quite touching.

Neither of them spoke.

The silence stretched, loaded with everything they weren't saying.

Noel's apartment was in the opposite direction from Eben's rental. They both knew this. They were walking the same direction anyway.

Noel should say something. Should address it. Should—

"You were good with him," Noel said before he could stop himself.

Eben glanced over. "Who?"

"The kid. The one whose pastry collapsed."

"Oh." Eben's expression shuttered slightly. "He just needed guidance."

"You were patient."

"It wasn't difficult."

"It was kind."

Eben stopped walking.

Noel stopped too, heart suddenly racing.

They stood on the quiet street, snow falling around them, and looked at each other.

"It wasn't—" Eben started, then stopped. His jaw tightened. "I just helped him. That's all."

"That's not all," Noel said softly.

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. Uncertainty. Vulnerability. Gone before Noel could name it.

"We should keep moving," Eben said. "It's cold."

He started walking again.

Noel followed, chest tight.

Great. Perfect. Emotionally unavailable glacier man was also secretly kind. Noel's type, apparently, was 'everything he thought he didn't want, served in one devastating package.'

He was in so much trouble.

They walked in silence for another block.

The streets were emptying as people headed home for dinner. Lights glowed in windows. Somewhere, someone was playing Christmas music—faint, cheerful, incongruous with the tension humming between them.

Noel's mind was racing.

He kept replaying the moment in the bakery. Eben crouching down. His voice going soft. The way he'd made that young man feel capable, valued, seen.

The way Noel wanted—desperately, dangerously—to be on the receiving end of that attention.

Stop. This doesn't matter. It was one kiss.

A really good kiss.

That didn't matter either.

Except it did.

It mattered that Eben was kind. It mattered that he helped people without expecting anything in return. It mattered that beneath the controlled exterior was someone who cared, even if he didn't want to admit it.

It mattered that Noel was falling for him.

The thought arrived fully formed, undeniable.

Noel stumbled.

Eben's hand shot out, steadying him.

"Careful."

His grip was firm. Warm through Noel's coat.

Noel looked up. Met Eben's eyes.

They were standing too close. Close enough that Noel could see the flour still dusting Eben's hair. Close enough to count the shades of gray in his eyes.

Close enough to kiss.

Eben's hand was still on his arm.

Neither of them moved.

"Noel," Eben said quietly.

It wasn't a question. It wasn't a statement. It was just his name, said in a voice that made Noel's breath catch.

The moment stretched.

Then Eben let go and stepped back.

"We should—" He cleared his throat. "The bake-off. Tomorrow. We need to coordinate."

Right. Work. Professional things.

"Right," Noel managed. "Tomorrow."

They started walking again.

But something had shifted.

Something was building between them, inevitable and terrifying, and Noel didn't know how to stop it.

Wasn't sure he wanted to.

# **Chapter 4**

## *Eben*

They'd succeeded.

Despite Hugh's flour disaster, despite the collapsed pastries and ruined fondant and general chaos, the bake-off had been a success. The contestants had left happy. Wes had looked pleased. The festival had another event checked off the list.

Eben should feel satisfied.

Instead, he felt off-balance.

It was Noel's fault.

Everything lately was Noel's fault, which wasn't fair, but Eben's capacity for fairness had been compromised somewhere around the moment Noel had looked at him in that flour-covered bakery and smiled like Eben had done something remarkable.

He hadn't. He'd just helped someone. It wasn't complicated.

Except Noel had made it feel complicated.

Had made it feel like it mattered.

Eben didn't know what to do with that.

They were walking through Tinsel Town's evening streets, snow falling in lazy spirals, neither speaking. The silence should have been comfortable. Professional.

It wasn't.

It was charged. Waiting.

Eben could feel the weight of everything unsaid pressing against his ribs.

"We did it," Noel said suddenly.

Eben glanced over. "We did."

"Despite everything."

"Because of everything," Eben corrected. "The chaos brought people together."

Noel's expression shifted—surprise, then something softer. "That's very optimistic of you."

"I'm not optimistic."

"You just said chaos brought people together. That's practically a motivational poster."

Eben's mouth twitched. "It's an observation."

"A positive observation."

"Don't get used to it."

Noel laughed—quiet, genuine—and Eben felt the sound settle somewhere dangerous in his chest.

This was their first real conversation since the kiss.

It felt monumental and inadequate all at once.

## *Noel*

They were talking.

Actually talking, not just coordinating logistics or avoiding eye contact. Talking like two people who might actually like each other.

Noel didn't know what to do with this information.

"You were good today," he said, because apparently he'd decided honesty was the way forward. "With the contestants. With... everything."

Eben's expression shuttered slightly. "So were you."

"I'm always good with people. That's my job."

"It's more than your job."

Noel blinked. "What?"

"You care." Eben said it simply, like it was obvious. "About everyone. Constantly. It's not performance."

Something warm and fragile bloomed in Noel's chest.

"Oh," he managed.

They walked in silence for another moment. The snow was picking up, dusting their shoulders, catching in Eben's dark hair.

Noel wanted to reach out and brush it away.

He didn't.

"Eben—"

"We should talk about it," Eben said at the same time.

They both stopped walking.

Looked at each other.

"The kiss," Eben clarified, even though they both knew exactly what he meant.

Noel's heart was suddenly very loud. "We probably should."

"Probably."

Neither of them talked about it.

The moment stretched, heavy with possibility.

Then Eben's phone rang.

## *Eben*

Of course it did.

Eben pulled out his phone, saw the mayor's name, and briefly considered throwing the device into a snowbank.

"I should—"

"Take it," Noel said. "It's fine."

It wasn't fine.

Eben answered. "Frost."

Mayor Kringle's voice was anxious, as always. Something about vendor permits and scheduling conflicts and could Eben please review the updated timeline because she was worried they were falling behind—

"I'll look at it tonight," Eben said, cutting through the spiral. "Send me the file."

"Oh, thank you, I knew I could count on you, you're so reliable—"

Eben ended the call.

Looked at Noel.

Noel was watching him with an expression Eben couldn't quite read.

"Work," Eben said unnecessarily.

"I gathered." Noel's smile was small. "You're very in-demand."

"The mayor is anxious."

"The mayor is always anxious. You're good at managing it."

There it was again. That simple acknowledgment. Like Eben's competence was something worth noticing.

Like he was something worth noticing.

Eben didn't know what to do with that either.

## *Noel*

They started walking again.

The conversation had been interrupted, but something had shifted. The air between them felt different. Less tense. More... open.

Noel took a breath.

"About the kiss," he said.

Eben went very still.

"I don't—" Noel stopped. Started again. "I don't want to pretend it didn't happen."

"Neither do I."

The admission hung between them.

"But I don't know what it means," Noel continued. "Or what you want it to mean. Or if—"

"I don't know either," Eben said quietly.

They looked at each other.

Snow fell around them. The street was empty, the town settling into evening quiet. Somewhere, a church bell chimed six times.

"I should go," Eben said. He didn't move.

"Yeah," Noel agreed. He didn't move either.

The space between them felt impossibly small and impossibly vast all at once.

"Tomorrow," Eben said finally.

"Tomorrow," Noel echoed.

Eben turned to leave.

"Eben."

He stopped. Looked back.

Noel's heart was racing. "I'm glad we're doing this. The festival. Together."

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. "So am I."

Then he walked away, and Noel stood in the falling snow, watching him go.

## *Eben*

Eben made it three blocks before he stopped.

Stood on the quiet street, snow falling, hands in his pockets.

He should go home. Review the mayor's timeline. Prepare for tomorrow. Do all the responsible, professional things he was supposed to do.

Instead, he stood there and thought about Noel.

About the way Noel had looked at him in the bakery. About the conversation they'd just had—halting, incomplete, but real. About the fact that Eben had almost told him the truth.

I don't know what this means, but I want to find out.

He hadn't said it.

But he'd wanted to.

That was dangerous.

Eben had spent years building walls. Keeping people at a distance. Protecting himself from the kind of attachment that destroyed things.

Noel was dismantling those walls without even trying.

Just by being kind. By caring. By looking at Eben like he was someone worth knowing.

Eben closed his eyes.

This was supposed to be temporary.

It didn't feel temporary.

It felt like the start of something.

And that terrified him.

## *Noel*

Noel walked home slowly.

His apartment was small, warm, cluttered with the organized chaos of someone who worked too much and slept too little. He dropped his coat on the chair. Made tea he didn't drink. Stood at the window and looked out at the snow.

He kept replaying the conversation.

I don't want to pretend it didn't happen.

Neither do I.

It wasn't a declaration. It wasn't a plan. It was just... honesty.

And somehow, that felt more significant than anything else.

Noel touched his lips.

He was falling for Eben Frost.

Maybe had already fallen.

That was terrifying and exhilarating and completely inadvisable, and Noel didn't know what to do about it.

Except—

Except maybe he didn't have to do anything. Maybe he could just... let it happen. See where it went. Stop trying to control everything and just feel.

The thought was radical.

Also possibly stupid.

But standing in his apartment, alone, thinking about the way Eben had looked at him in the snow—

Noel thought maybe stupid was worth it.

## *Eben*

Eben's rental was cold when he got home.

He turned up the heat. Made coffee. Opened his laptop.

His phone buzzed.

**Noel**: Thanks for today. For helping that kid. For being patient. For... everything.

**Eben**: You're welcome.

**Noel**: See you tomorrow?

**Eben**: Yes.

He set the phone down.

Tomorrow.

That felt like enough.

# **Chapter 5**

The next day started normal.

Noel arrived at Merryweather Hall. Checked his emails. Coordinated with vendors. Did all the professional, competent things he was supposed to do.

Eben was there. Also being professional. Also being competent.

They nodded at each other across the hall.

It was very mature.

It lasted approximately two hours.

At ten-thirty, Noel's phone buzzed.

**Eben**: Need to check the lighting setup at Evergreen Square. Want to come?

Noel stared at the message.

It was a work request. Completely reasonable. They were co-managing the festival. Of course they'd need to coordinate on-site.

Except.

Except it felt like more than that.

**Noel**: Sure. Meet you there?

**Eben**: I'll walk with you.

Noel's heart did something complicated.

Professional. This is professional.

He grabbed his coat.

They walked through Tinsel Town in silence.

It wasn't the tense silence from yesterday. It was something else. Something almost comfortable, if comfort could coexist with the constant awareness of another person's presence.

Noel was hyperaware of Eben beside him. The way he moved. The way his breath fogged in the cold air. The way their shoulders almost brushed with every step.

"You're quiet," Eben observed.

"Thinking."

"About?"

You. Always you. The kiss. What happens next. Whether I'm reading this completely wrong.

"Work," Noel said.

Eben's expression suggested he didn't believe that, but he didn't push.

They reached Evergreen Square. The main festival space was already taking shape—vendor booths, string lights, a small stage for performances. It looked magical, even half-finished.

Eben pulled out a tablet, started checking measurements against the plan.

Noel watched him work.

"The lights need to be higher," Eben said, pointing to a strand that was sagging. "And that booth is three feet off-center."

"You measured that by looking?"

"Yes."

"That's unsettling."

Eben's mouth twitched. "It's efficient."

"It's unsettling efficiency."

This time, Eben almost smiled. "I'll take that as a compliment."

"You would."

They fell into an easy rhythm—Eben identifying problems, Noel coordinating solutions. It was the same dynamic they'd had since the beginning, but something about it felt different now. Less adversarial. More... partnership.

Noel liked it.

Liked it more than was probably safe.

An hour later, the square was sorted.

Lights adjusted. Booths realigned. Everything exactly as it should be.

They stood in the center of the space, surrounded by twinkling lights and the smell of pine, and Noel realized he didn't want to leave.

"We should head back," Eben said.

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

The square was quiet. Most of the vendors had left for lunch. It was just them, standing in the cold, snow starting to fall again.

"Noel."

Eben's voice was different. Softer.

Noel looked at him.

Eben was watching him with an expression Noel couldn't quite read. Something careful. Something vulnerable.

"Last night," Eben started. "When I said I didn't know what this meant—"

"I know."

"I wasn't—" Eben stopped. Took a breath. "I wasn't lying. I don't know. But I—"

He stopped again.

Noel waited.

The snow fell around them. The lights twinkled. The world felt very small and very large all at once.

"I want to find out," Eben said finally.

Noel's breath caught.

"What?"

"I want to find out what this means." Eben's jaw was tight, like the admission cost him something. "If you—if that's something you want."

Noel stared at him.

Eben Frost, controlled and careful and emotionally unavailable, was standing in the middle of Evergreen Square asking if Noel wanted to see where this went.

"Yes," Noel said. "Yes, I want that."

Something in Eben's expression eased.

"Okay."

"Okay."

They stood there, looking at each other, and Noel felt like something fundamental had just shifted.

They walked back to the hall together.

Didn't talk about what had just happened. Didn't define it or analyze it or make plans.

Just walked, close enough that their hands almost touched, and let the possibility of it settle between them.

When they reached Merryweather Hall, Eben stopped.

"I have to review the vendor contracts," he said.

"I have to confirm the entertainment schedule."

"Right."

They stood there.

"Tonight," Eben said. "After work. Do you want to—"

"Yes."

Eben blinked. "I didn't finish the question."

"Doesn't matter. The answer is yes."

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. Almost amusement. Almost fondness.

"Seven o'clock," he said. "I'll meet you here."

"Okay."

Eben turned to leave, then stopped. Looked back.

"Noel."

"Yeah?"

"I'm—" He paused. "I'm glad we're doing this."

Noel's chest felt too full. "Me too."

Eben nodded once and walked inside.

Noel stood in the cold, heart racing, and tried to process what had just happened.

They were doing this.

Whatever this was.

He was terrified.

He was exhilarated.

He was completely, utterly in over his head.

And he didn't care.

The rest of the day passed in a blur.

Noel confirmed schedules. Answered emails. Coordinated with Hugh about decorations and only had to veto three glitter-related ideas.

The whole time, his mind was elsewhere.

Seven o'clock.

Eben had said seven o'clock.

Noel checked his watch approximately every five minutes.

At six-thirty, Wes appeared beside him.

"You're vibrating," Wes observed.

"I'm fine."

"You're vibrating with nervous energy. It's very obvious."

Noel gave him a look. "Don't you have a bakery to run?"

"Closed early." Wes's smile was knowing. "Thought I'd check on you. See how things are going."

"Things are fine."

"Mmm."

That sound again. Noel was starting to hate that sound.

"Wes—"

"I'm not going to pry," Wes said, which was definitely a lie. "I'm just going to say that whatever you're nervous about, you should probably just be honest about it."

"I am being honest."

"With yourself?"

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it.

Wes patted his shoulder. "Seven o'clock, right?"

"How did you—"

"I know everything." Wes's smile widened. "Have fun."

He left before Noel could respond.

Noel checked his watch.

Six forty-five.

He was definitely vibrating.

At seven o'clock exactly, Eben appeared.

He'd changed—not into anything fancy, just a different jacket, cleaner boots. But the effort was there. Visible.

Noel's heart did that complicated thing again.

"Hi," Noel said.

"Hi."

They stood there, suddenly awkward.

"So," Noel started. "What—"

"Walk?" Eben suggested.

"Yeah. Okay."

They walked.

The town was beautiful in the evening. Lights everywhere, snow falling gently, the kind of picture-perfect winter scene that belonged on a postcard.

Noel barely noticed.

He was too aware of Eben beside him. The silence between them. The weight of everything unsaid.

"I don't know how to do this," Noel admitted finally.

Eben glanced over. "Do what?"

"This. Whatever this is. I'm usually—I'm good at people. At knowing what to say. But with you, I—"

He stopped.

Eben was watching him with that careful attention that made Noel feel seen in a way that was both terrifying and exhilarating.

"Neither do I," Eben said quietly.

"Really?"

"Really."

They kept walking.

"So what do we do?" Noel asked.

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "We figure it out."

Something in Noel's chest eased.

They turned down a quieter street. Fewer lights here. More shadows. The kind of place where conversations felt safer.

"Can I ask you something?" Noel said.

"Yes."

"Why did you come here? To Tinsel Town. Why did you take this job?"

Eben's expression shuttered slightly. "It was temporary."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the answer I have."

Noel let it sit. Didn't push.

After a moment, Eben continued. "I don't stay places. I don't—I'm not good at staying."

"Why not?"

"Because staying means attachment. And attachment—"

He stopped.

Noel waited.

"Attachment destroys things," Eben said finally. "In my experience."

The words landed heavy between them.

Noel understood, suddenly, why Eben kept everyone at a distance. Why he was so controlled. Why he'd tried so hard to pretend the kiss hadn't happened.

"I'm sorry," Noel said.

"Don't be."

"I am anyway."

Eben looked at him. Something vulnerable flickered in his eyes.

"I don't want to destroy this," he said quietly.

"You won't."

"You don't know that."

"I know you," Noel said. "You're careful. You're kind. You're—"

He stopped, suddenly aware of how much he was revealing.

Eben was very still.

"I'm what?" he asked softly.

Noel took a breath.

"You're someone I want to know," he said. "Really know. Not just the professional version. The real version."

The words hung between them.

Eben's expression did something complicated.

Then he stopped walking.

They were on a quiet street. Alone. Snow falling around them.

"Noel," Eben said.

His voice was rough. Careful.

Noel's heart was racing.

"Yeah?"

"I want to kiss you again."

The world narrowed to just them.

"Okay," Noel managed.

"Is that okay?"

"Yes. Please."

Eben stepped closer.

Noel stopped breathing.

"I don't know what this is," Eben said quietly. "Or where it's going. But I—"

"I want to," Noel interrupted. "Whatever happens next. I want to."

Eben's breath caught.

"You're sure?"

"I'm sure."

Eben kissed him.

It was different from the first time. Slower. More deliberate. Like Eben was trying to memorize the moment.

Noel kissed back, hands fisting in Eben's jacket, and felt something in his chest crack open.

This was real.

This was happening.

And Noel wanted it more than he'd wanted anything in a long time.

When they pulled apart, they were both breathing hard.

"Come home with me," Noel said.

Eben's eyes darkened.

"Are you sure?"

"I'm sure."

"Noel—"

"Please."

Eben closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them, they were full of something Noel couldn't name.

"Okay," he said.

They walked to Noel's apartment.

Neither of them said a word.

But their hands were clasped together, and that felt like enough.

# **Chapter 6**

The door to Noel's apartment barely closed before they were kissing again.

Desperate. Hungry. Like they'd been holding back for days and finally had permission to stop.

Noel's back hit the wall. Eben's hands were in his hair, on his face, everywhere. Noel kissed back with everything he had, fingers clutching at Eben's jacket, pulling him closer.

This was happening.

This was really happening.

"Bedroom?" Eben asked against his mouth.

"Couch is closer."

"Couch works."

They stumbled across the small apartment, still kissing, hands fumbling with coats and scarves. Noel's coat hit the floor. Eben's followed. They made it to the couch—barely—and Noel pulled Eben down with him.

For a moment, they just looked at each other.

Eben was breathing hard. His hair was mussed from Noel's hands. His eyes were dark, intense, focused entirely on Noel like nothing else in the world mattered.

Noel felt seen.

Completely, utterly seen.

"Hi," he managed.

Eben's mouth curved. Almost a smile. "Hi."

Then he kissed Noel again, and thinking became difficult.

## *Eben*

This was a terrible idea.

Eben knew it was a terrible idea. He'd known it from the moment Noel had looked at him in Evergreen Square and said yes like it was the easiest answer in the world.

He should stop. Should pull back. Should remember all the reasons why attachment was dangerous and temporary was safer and letting himself want this was a mistake.

He didn't stop.

Couldn't stop.

Not when Noel was kissing him like this. Not when Noel's hands were sliding under his shirt, warm against his skin. Not when every touch felt like a confession.

"Eben," Noel breathed.

His name. Just his name. But the way Noel said it—

Eben kissed him harder.

Noel made a sound—soft, wanting—and Eben felt it everywhere.

"Do you want this?" Eben asked, pulling back just enough to meet Noel's eyes.

"Yes."

"Are you sure?"

"I'm sure." Noel's hands framed his face. "I want this. I want you."

The words hit Eben like a physical thing.

"Tell me if you want me to stop," Eben said.

"Please don't stop."

Eben kissed him again. Slower this time. Deliberate. Learning the shape of Noel's mouth, the way he responded to touch, the sounds he made when Eben's hands found sensitive places.

This wasn't just physical.

It couldn't be just physical.

Not when it felt like this.

## *Noel*

Noel had done this before.

Obviously. He wasn't inexperienced. He knew how this worked.

But this—

This felt different.

Eben's hands were careful. Deliberate. Like he was trying to memorize every inch of Noel's skin. Like this mattered.

Like Noel mattered.

"Shirt," Noel managed. "Off."

Eben pulled back long enough to tug his shirt over his head.

Noel stared.

He'd known Eben was fit—you couldn't move the way Eben did without being in shape—but seeing it was different. Lean muscle. Pale skin. A few scars Noel wanted to ask about later.

"You're staring," Eben observed.

"You're attractive."

"So are you."

Noel's breath caught.

Eben leaned down, kissed him again. His hands found the hem of Noel's shirt, paused.

"May I?"

The question was soft. Careful.

Consent as foreplay.

"Yes," Noel said.

Eben removed Noel's shirt with the same deliberate care he brought to everything. Then his hands were on Noel's skin, and Noel stopped thinking entirely.

They moved together—awkward at first, then finding a rhythm.

Clothes came off in stages. Eben's jeans. Noel's. Hands learning new territory. Mouths following.

"Okay?" Eben asked.

"Yes. More."

"Tell me what you want."

Noel's brain short-circuited. "I—everything. Anything. Just—don't stop."

Eben's expression softened. "I won't."

He kissed Noel's neck. His collarbone. Lower.

Noel's hands fisted in the couch cushions.

This was—

This was—

"Eben," he gasped.

"I'm here."

And he was. Completely present. Completely focused. Like nothing else existed except this moment, this connection, the two of them learning each other.

Noel had never felt so wanted in his life.

## *Eben*

Noel was falling apart beneath him.

Eben could see it—the way his breath came faster, the way his hands clutched at Eben's shoulders, the way he said Eben's name like a prayer.

It was the most beautiful thing Eben had ever seen.

"Look at me," Eben said.

Noel's eyes opened. Met his.

The connection was immediate. Overwhelming.

Eben had meant to keep this simple. Physical. Something they could both walk away from when the festival ended.

But looking into Noel's eyes—seeing the trust there, the vulnerability, the raw honesty—

There was nothing simple about this.

"Eben," Noel whispered.

"I'm here," Eben said again. "I've got you."

He moved with deliberate care. Watching Noel's face. Learning what made him gasp, what made him arch, what made him say Eben's name in that breathless way that made Eben's control fracture.

"Is this okay?" Eben asked.

"Yes. God, yes."

"Tell me if—"

"It's perfect. You're perfect. Don't stop."

Eben kissed him. Poured everything he couldn't say into the kiss.

I want you.

## *Noel*

Noel was drowning.

In sensation. In emotion. In the overwhelming reality of Eben Frost touching him like he was something precious.

"Close," Noel managed. "I'm—"

"Let go," Eben said against his mouth. "I've got you."

Noel believed him.

He let go.

The world went white. Pleasure crashed through him—intense, overwhelming, perfect.

He heard himself say Eben's name. Felt Eben's hands on him, steady and sure. Felt the moment Eben followed him over the edge.

Then they were both breathing hard, tangled together on the couch, and Noel felt like something fundamental had just changed.

For a long moment, neither of them moved.

Then Eben shifted, carefully extracting himself. Noel made a sound of protest.

"Just—give me a second," Eben said.

He disappeared into what Noel assumed was the bathroom. Returned with a warm cloth.

Noel watched, dazed, as Eben cleaned them both up with the same careful attention he'd brought to everything else.

"You don't have to—"

"I want to," Eben said quietly.

When he was done, he draped Noel's discarded shirt over his shoulders—a small gesture, but it made Noel's chest ache.

"Are you okay?" Eben asked.

Noel looked at him.

Eben was watching him with an expression that was careful and vulnerable all at once. Like he genuinely needed to know the answer.

"I don't know," Noel said honestly.

Eben's expression flickered. "Did I—"

"No. God, no. That was—" Noel stopped. Started again. "That was perfect. I just—I don't know what this means. What we are. What happens next."

Eben was quiet for a moment.

Then he sat beside Noel on the couch. Close, but not quite touching.

"I don't know either," he admitted.

They sat in silence.

The apartment was quiet. Outside, snow was still falling. The world felt very far away.

"I should probably go," Eben said finally.

Noel's chest tightened. "Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

"Unless—" Eben stopped.

"Unless what?"

"Unless you want me to stay."

Noel looked at him. Eben's expression was carefully neutral, but his eyes gave him away.

He wanted to stay.

He was just waiting for permission.

"Stay," Noel said.

"Are you sure?"

"I'm sure."

Something in Eben's expression eased.

"Okay," he said. "I'll stay."

## *Noel*

They moved to the bed.

Not for sex—though Noel wouldn't have objected—but just to lie together. To exist in the same space without the weight of decision or definition.

Eben settled beside him, careful to leave space.

Noel closed the space, tucking himself against Eben's side.

For a moment, Eben went very still.

Then his arm came around Noel, and Noel felt him relax.

"This is okay?" Eben asked quietly.

"This is perfect."

They lay there in the dark.

Noel's mind was racing. Processing. Trying to make sense of what had just happened.

They'd had sex.

Good sex. Great sex. The kind of sex that rewired things.

And now Eben was staying.

Holding him.

Like this meant something.

"Eben?"

"Yeah?"

"I'm glad you're here."

Eben's arm tightened around him. "Me too."

Noel closed his eyes.

He didn't know what this was. Didn't know where it was going. Didn't know if Eben would still be here in the morning or if this was just one night.

But right now, in this moment, it was enough.

## *Eben*

Eben lay awake long after Noel's breathing evened out.

He should leave. Should go back to his rental. Should put distance between them before this became something he couldn't walk away from.

He didn't move.

Noel was warm against his side. Trusting. Vulnerable in sleep in a way he never was awake.

Eben looked at him and felt something crack open in his chest.

This was supposed to be temporary.

This was supposed to be simple.

This was supposed to be safe.

It wasn't any of those things.

It was terrifying and complicated and dangerous, and Eben wanted it anyway.

Wanted him anyway.

That was the most frightening realization of all.

Eben closed his eyes.

Tomorrow, he'd figure out what to do about this.

Tonight, he'd just... let himself have it.

Let himself want.

Let himself stay.

That felt like enough.

# **Chapter 7**

Eben woke to pale morning light and the unfamiliar weight of another person beside him.

For a moment, he didn't move. Just lay there, processing.

Noel's apartment. Noel's bed.

Noel, still asleep, curled against his side like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Eben's chest tightened.

He should leave. Should extract himself carefully, get dressed, go back to his rental before this became more complicated than it already was.

He didn't move.

Noel shifted in his sleep, made a small sound, and settled closer.

Eben closed his eyes.

What am I doing?

Last night had been—

Eben didn't have words for what last night had been.

Intense. Overwhelming. Perfect.

Terrifying.

He'd meant to keep it simple. Physical. Something they could both walk away from when the festival ended and Eben left Tinsel Town for the next temporary job.

But lying here, with Noel warm and trusting against him, Eben knew it was too late for simple.

This meant something.

He meant something.

And that was the problem.

Noel stirred.

Eben felt the moment he woke—the slight tension, the shift from sleep to awareness.

"Morning," Noel mumbled against his shoulder.

"Morning."

A pause. Then Noel lifted his head, blinking sleep from his eyes.

He looked rumpled. Soft. Beautiful in the early light.

Eben's heart did something complicated.

"You stayed," Noel said.

"I did."

"I wasn't sure you would."

The honesty in those words hurt.

"I said I would," Eben said quietly.

"I know. I just—" Noel stopped. Looked away. "People don't usually stay."

Eben understood, suddenly, that this wasn't just about him. That Noel had been left before. Had learned not to expect permanence.

"I'm here," Eben said.

Noel looked at him. Something vulnerable flickered in his eyes.

"For how long?"

The question hung between them.

Eben didn't have an answer.

"I don't know," he admitted.

Noel nodded. Like he'd expected that. Like he'd been bracing for it.

"Right," he said. "Temporary."

The word felt wrong.

Everything about this felt wrong.

Not the being here. Not the waking up beside Noel. But the fact that Eben didn't know how to make it anything other than temporary.

Didn't know if he was capable of more.

They lay in silence for a moment.

Outside, Tinsel Town was waking up. Eben could hear the faint sounds of morning—footsteps on snow, a car starting, someone calling a greeting.

Normal sounds. Normal morning.

Nothing about this felt normal.

"I should—" Eben started.

"Yeah," Noel said quickly. "You probably have work. Things to do. I get it."

He was pulling away. Emotionally, if not physically. Eben could feel it.

"Noel—"

"It's fine. Really. Last night was—it was good. Great. But I know what this is. Temporary. No expectations."

The words were light. Casual.

They didn't match the tension in Noel's shoulders.

Eben sat up. Noel did too, putting careful distance between them.

"I—" Eben stopped. Started again. "I'm not good at this. At staying. At letting people in. At—"

"Do what?"

"This. Whatever this is. I don't—I'm not good at staying. At letting people in. At—"

"Attachment," Noel finished quietly.

Eben looked at him.

Noel's expression was understanding. Sad.

"I know," Noel said. "You told me. Attachment destroys things."

"In my experience, yes."

"So what was last night?"

The question was gentle. Not accusatory. Just... honest.

Eben didn't know how to answer.

"I don't know," he said finally. "But it wasn't nothing."

"No," Noel agreed. "It wasn't nothing."

They looked at each other.

The morning light made everything feel too real. Too exposed.

"I should go," Eben said.

"Okay."

Neither of them moved.

"Unless—" Eben stopped.

"Unless what?"

"Unless you want me to stay. For coffee. Or—"

"Do you want to stay?" Noel asked.

Eben looked at him. At the careful hope in his eyes. At the way he was trying not to expect anything.

"Yes," Eben said. "I want to stay."

Noel's expression softened. "Okay. Then stay."

They made coffee together.

It was domestic. Comfortable. Noel moved around his small kitchen with easy familiarity, and Eben found himself watching. Learning the rhythms of Noel's morning routine.

The way he hummed while the coffee brewed. The way he pulled two mugs from the cabinet without asking if Eben wanted any. The way he added sugar to his own cup—two spoonfuls, precise—and left Eben's black.

"How did you know I take it black?" Eben asked.

Noel glanced over. "You ordered it black at the Garland Cup. First day we met."

"You remember that?"

"I remember a lot of things."

The admission hung between them.

Eben took the offered mug. Their fingers brushed.

Neither of them pulled away.

"Thank you," Eben said.

"For the coffee?"

"For—" Eben stopped. "For last night. For this. For not making it complicated."

Noel's smile was small. Sad. "It's already complicated."

"I know."

"But we're doing it anyway."

"Yes."

They stood in Noel's small kitchen, drinking coffee, and Eben felt something settle in his chest.

This was dangerous.

This was exactly the kind of attachment he'd spent years avoiding.

But standing here, with Noel looking at him like he was something worth keeping—

Eben thought maybe dangerous was worth it.

"I have to go," Eben said eventually.

They'd finished their coffee. The morning was progressing. Work was waiting.

"I know," Noel said.

Eben set his mug in the sink. Started gathering his things—coat, scarf, the pieces of himself he'd left scattered around Noel's apartment.

Noel watched from the doorway.

"Eben?"

Eben turned.

Noel was backlit by the morning sun, and for a moment, Eben couldn't breathe.

"Yeah?"

"Are we—" Noel stopped. Started again. "What are we doing?"

It was the question Eben had been avoiding.

"I don't know," he said honestly.

"Do you want to figure it out?"

Eben looked at him. At the vulnerability in his expression. At the way he was asking for something without demanding it.

"Yes," Eben said. "I want to figure it out."

Noel's smile was small. Genuine. "Okay."

"Okay."

Eben crossed the space between them. Kissed Noel—brief, loaded with everything he couldn't say.

When he pulled back, Noel's eyes were soft.

"Tomorrow?" Noel asked.

"Tomorrow," Eben agreed.

He left before he could change his mind.

The walk back to his rental was cold.

Eben barely felt it.

His mind was too busy processing. Analyzing. Trying to make sense of what had just happened.

He'd stayed the night.

He'd had coffee with Noel.

He'd agreed to figure this out.

All things he'd sworn he wouldn't do.

All things that felt terrifyingly right.

Eben reached his rental, let himself in, stood in the empty space.

It felt wrong now. Too quiet. Too impersonal.

Not like Noel's apartment, which had been warm and lived-in and full of small details that told stories.

Eben sat on the edge of the bed.

Pulled out his phone.

Stared at it for a long moment.

Then he typed a message.

**Eben**: Thank you for last night.

He hit send before he could overthink it.

The response came almost immediately.

**Noel**: Thank you for staying.

Eben stared at the message.

Something in his chest cracked open.

He typed another message.

**Eben**: I meant what I said. I want to figure this out.

**Noel**: Me too.

**Eben**: I don't know how.

**Noel**: We'll learn.

Eben closed his eyes.

We'll learn.

As if it were that simple.

As if wanting something was enough to make it work.

Eben had never believed that before.

But sitting in his empty rental, thinking about Noel's smile and the way he'd said stay like it was the easiest thing in the world—

Eben thought maybe he wanted to believe it.

He spent the rest of the morning working.

Reviewed the mayor's timeline. Confirmed vendor schedules. Answered emails with his usual efficiency.

But his mind kept drifting.

To Noel. To last night. To the way it had felt to wake up beside someone and not immediately want to leave.

This was dangerous.

This was exactly what he'd been avoiding.

But it was also—

It was also the first time in years that Eben had felt like he was part of something. Connected to something. Like he mattered to someone beyond his competence and efficiency.

Noel saw him.

Really saw him.

And instead of being terrified by that—

Eben wanted more of it.

That was the most frightening thing of all.

At noon, his phone buzzed.

**Noel**: Lunch? If you're not busy.

Eben stared at the message.

He should say no. Should maintain distance. Should remember that this was temporary and getting more involved would only make it harder when he left.

He typed a response.

**Eben**: Where?

**Noel**: Garland Cup? 12:30?

**Eben**: I'll be there.

**Before the Twelve Days begin...**

Meet Eben Frost the night before.

One phone call. One contract. One very stubborn rule about not getting attached.

Eben Frost drives through the night to a town that shouldn't exist, for a job he shouldn't have taken, to help a man he hasn't met yet.

This is the moment before everything changes.
