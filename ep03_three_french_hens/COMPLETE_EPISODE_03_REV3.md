# Chapter 1: Avoidance Dance

They were going to be professional about this. They were adults. Adults who had done adult things togetherâ€”specifically kissing-related adult thingsâ€”and were now pretending it hadn't happened. Very adult behavior.

Noel stared at his ceiling and tried to convince himself this was fine.

It wasn't working.

He'd been awake since four. Not because he'd woken up at fourâ€”he hadn't slept. Sleep required not replaying the same thirty seconds of his life on an endless loop, and Noel's brain had apparently decided that was too much to ask.

The kiss.

*The kiss.*

He touched his lips. Again. For probably the hundredth time since last night.

This was pathetic. He was pathetic. He was a grown man lying in bed touching his own mouth like some kind ofâ€”

His alarm went off.

Noel slapped it silent and dragged himself upright. His reflection in the bathroom mirror looked how he felt: rumpled, exhausted, and vaguely unhinged. Perfect. Exactly the impression he wanted to make when he saw Eben this morning.

When he saw Eben.

Who he'd kissed.

Who'd kissed him back.

"Stop," Noel told his reflection. His reflection didn't listen. It kept looking at him with those dark-circled eyes that screamed *I made a choice and now I'm thinking about it.*

He showered. Got dressed. Made coffee he didn't drink. Stood in his tiny apartment and tried to figure out how to be normal.

The problemâ€”one of many problemsâ€”was that the kiss had been *good*. Not just good. Devastating. The kind of kiss that rewired things. The kind that made a person wonder if maybe all their previous kisses had just been practice for that specific moment in a cramped office that smelled like pine and old wood.

Noel grabbed his coat.

He was going to go to work. He was going to be professional. He was going to act like a competent adult who occasionally kissed his temporary work partner and then moved on with his life like it was no big deal.

Easy.

---

Merryweather Hall looked the same as always. Twinkling lights. Garland everywhere. The faint smell of cinnamon from whatever Hugh was crafting in the back room. Normal. Familiar.

Noel pushed through the front doors and immediately spotted Eben.

Of course he did. Eben was standing near the main desk, reviewing something on a clipboard, looking completely unbothered. Put-together. Rested. Like he'd slept just fine, thank you, and wasn't currently having an internal crisis about appropriate workplace behavior.

Noel hated him a little bit.

Eben looked up.

Their eyes met.

Noel's brain went blank.

For one horrible, endless second, neither of them moved. Then Eben's gaze flicked awayâ€”quick, deliberateâ€”and returned to his clipboard like it contained the secrets of the universe.

Right. Okay. So that's how this was going to go.

Noel crossed to his own workspace on the opposite side of the hall. Far away. A responsible distance for two professionals who were being normal about things.

He pulled out his laptop. Opened his task list. Stared at it without reading a single word.

Across the room, Eben was doing something with vendor contracts. Probably. Noel wasn't watching him. He was absolutely not tracking Eben's movements in his peripheral vision like some kind of obsessiveâ€”

Eben shifted. Rolled his shoulders.

Noel looked down at his screen so fast he almost gave himself whiplash.

This was fine. Everything was fine. He just needed to focus. There was work to do. The festival didn't plan itself. He had emails to answer, schedules to confirm, a bake-off happening this afternoon that he definitely hadn't forgotten about until just this second.

The bake-off.

At Candle & Crumb.

Where he and Eben would both need to be.

Together.

Noel closed his eyes.

Professional. He could be professional. He'd been professional his entire career. This was just another event. Another day. The fact that he could still feel the ghost of Eben's mouth on his was irrelevant.

Completely irrelevant.

He opened his eyes and started typing an email. Got three words in before he realized he was typing gibberish. Deleted it. Started again.

Across the hall, Eben's phone rang. Noel heard him answerâ€”low, clipped, efficient. That voice. The same voice that had said Noel's name last night, soft and rough andâ€”

Noel stood up.

He needed air. Or coffee. Or a lobotomy.

He made it halfway to the door before Eben spoke.

"Merrick."

Noel stopped. Turned.

Eben was looking at him now. Really looking. His expression was unreadableâ€”controlled, careful, giving nothing away. But his eyes were doing something complicated.

"The bake-off," Eben said. "This afternoon."

"I know."

"We should coordinate."

"Right. Yes. Coordination. Very important."

A pause. Eben's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

"Two o'clock," he said.

"I'll be there."

Another pause. Longer this time. The air between them felt heavy, loaded with everything they weren't saying.

Then Eben nodded once and returned to his clipboard.

Dismissed.

Noel walked outside into the cold and breathed.

---

He spent the rest of the morning aggressively useful. Confirmed vendor deliveries. Answered seventeen emails. Reorganized the supply closet even though it didn't need reorganizing. Anything to avoid thinking about the fact that in three hours, he'd be in an enclosed space with Eben Frost, pretending everything was normal.

The universe, apparently, thought this was hilarious.

At one-thirty, Noel's phone buzzed.

**Wes Candle:** *Ready for this afternoon? Got everything prepped. Should be fun. ðŸ˜Š*

Noel stared at the smiley face. Wes knew. Somehow, Wes always knew everything. It was unnerving.

**Noel:** *Ready. See you at two.*

**Wes:** *Both of you?*

Noel's thumb hovered over the keyboard.

**Noel:** *Yes. Both of us.*

**Wes:** *Good. ðŸ˜Š*

That second smiley face felt pointed.

Noel pocketed his phone and checked the time. One forty-five. He should head over. Get there early. Establish himself in the space before Eben arrived so he wouldn't have to do the awkward "oh hello we're both here now" thing.

Solid plan.

He grabbed his coat and turned toward the door.

Eben was already standing there, pulling on his gloves.

Of course he was.

"Ready?" Eben asked.

His voice was neutral. Professional. Like last night had happened to two completely different people.

Noel managed a smile. "Ready."

They walked to Candle & Crumb together.

Neither of them said a word.

---

The bakery smelled like sugar and cinnamon and something else Noel couldn't identifyâ€”maybe optimism, maybe impending disaster. The line between the two was thinner than people thought.

Wes was behind the counter, setting out mixing bowls with the kind of precision that suggested he'd done this before. Which he had. Multiple times. The annual bake-off was a Tinsel Town institution, and Wes ran it like a general commanding troops.

He looked up when they entered. His smile was warm and knowing and made Noel want to sink into the floor.

"There you are," Wes said. "Both of you. Together."

"We work together," Noel said quickly. "So. Yes. Together. Professionally."

Eben said nothing. He was studying the bakery layout like it might contain traps.

Wes's smile didn't waver. "Contestants should start arriving soon. Noel, you're handling check-in. Eben, you're on logisticsâ€”making sure everyone has what they need, no fights over oven space, that sort of thing."

"Understood," Eben said.

"Great." Wes's gaze flicked between them, assessing. "This should be fun."

The way he said *fun* suggested he had a very different definition of the word than most people.

Noel busied himself setting up the check-in table. Clipboard. Name tags. Pens. Simple tasks. Manageable tasks. Tasks that didn't require thinking about the fact that Eben was ten feet away, moving through the space with that quiet competence that wasâ€”

Stop.

Focus.

The first contestants arrived. Noel smiled, checked names, handed out aprons. Fell into the familiar rhythm of being helpful. This, at least, he knew how to do.

Eben worked the room with the same controlled efficiency he brought to everything. Directing people to stations. Answering questions. Not smiling, but not unfriendly either. Just... Eben.

They didn't look at each other.

They were very, very good at not looking at each other.

Right up until the moment their paths crossed near the supply table and Noel reached for the same bag of flour as Eben and their hands touched.

It lasted half a second.

Noel pulled back like he'd been burned.

Eben's expression didn't change, but something flickered in his eyesâ€”quick, unguarded, gone before Noel could name it.

"Sorry," Noel said.

"It's fine."

It wasn't fine. Nothing about this was fine.

Noel grabbed a different bag of flour and retreated to the other side of the bakery.

This was going to be a very long afternoon.
# Chapter 2: Bake-off Brief

The kiss had been a mistake.

Obviously.

Eben had spent the entire night cataloging the reasons why. The list was extensive. Well-organized. Convincing.

None of it mattered, because he could still feel Noel's mouth on his.

This was a problem.

Eben adjusted the oven temperature for station three and tried to focus. The bake-off was simple: twelve contestants, three hours, minimal supervision required. He'd handled more complicated logistics in his sleep. This should be easy.

It wasn't easy.

Noel was across the bakery, laughing at something a contestant said. Bright, genuine laughter that made his whole face change. Eben had noticed this approximately forty-seven times in the past hour and was beginning to suspect he had a problem that went beyond poor decision-making.

"Interesting day yesterday?"

Eben didn't jump. He had more self-control than that. But it was close.

Wes was beside him, wiping down the counter with a cloth that didn't need wiping. His expression was mild. Friendly. Deeply suspicious.

"Standard," Eben said.

"Mmm."

That was it. Just *mmm*. But the sound contained multitudes. Wes had a gift for packing entire conversations into single syllables.

Eben hated it.

"The bake-off should run smoothly," Eben said, because redirecting was a valid strategy. "You've prepared well."

"I always do." Wes folded the cloth with unnecessary precision. "Though preparation only goes so far when people are... distracted."

Eben's jaw tightened. "I'm not distracted."

"Of course not." Wes's smile was gentle. Infuriating. "Neither is Noel, I'm sure. He's been very focused. Haven't seen him look your way once."

Eben said nothing. Across the bakery, Noel was helping an elderly woman tie her apron. His hands were careful. Patient.

Eben looked away.

"Right," Wes said softly. "Not distracted at all."

He drifted off to greet new arrivals, leaving Eben standing alone near the ovens, feeling like he'd just failed a test he hadn't known he was taking.

---

The contestants were a mix of Tinsel Town regulars and a few brave souls from neighboring areas. Eben recognized most of them: the librarian who made exceptional shortbread, the postal worker with a fondness for elaborate layer cakes, the teenager who'd won last year with a pie that had made grown adults weep.

They were cheerful. Excited. Completely unaware that Eben was having a minor crisis in the corner.

He forced himself to focus. Checked that each station had the required equipment. Confirmed oven schedules. Answered questions about ingredient substitutions with the kind of patience that came from years of managing other people's chaos.

This was fine. He was fine.

Then Noel laughed againâ€”that same unguarded soundâ€”and Eben's concentration shattered.

This was not fine.

The kiss had been a lapse in judgment. A momentary weakness caused by exhaustion and proximity and the way Noel had looked at him in that tiny office, like Eben was something worth wanting. That wasn't a reason. That was an excuse.

Eben didn't do excuses.

He also didn't do whatever this was: standing in a bakery pretending to review a supply list while actually tracking Noel's location like his life depended on it.

"Mr. Frost?"

Eben blinked. One of the contestantsâ€”a nervous young man with flour already on his shirtâ€”was hovering nearby.

"Yes?"

"I can't find the vanilla extract."

Eben located it in under ten seconds. The man thanked him profusely and scurried back to his station.

Simple. Manageable. This was what Eben was good at: solving problems, maintaining order, keeping everything running smoothly.

He could do this.

He just needed to stop looking at Noel.

---

The bake-off officially started at two-thirty. Wes rang a small bellâ€”because of course he had a bellâ€”and the bakery erupted into controlled chaos.

Mixers whirred. Ovens preheated. Someone dropped a whisk and it clattered across the floor. The teenager from last year was already three steps ahead of everyone else, moving with the confidence of someone who knew exactly what they were doing.

Eben stationed himself near the back, ready to intervene if anything went wrong.

Noel was up front, charming the crowd. He'd somehow convinced two competitors who'd been glaring at each other over counter space to share, and now they were laughing together like old friends.

Eben watched.

He shouldn't be watching.

He watched anyway.

Noel had a gift for thisâ€”for making people feel seen, valued, like they mattered. It wasn't an act. Eben had spent enough time observing to know the difference between performance and genuine care. Noel cared. About everyone. Constantly. It was exhausting just witnessing it.

It was also... something else. Something Eben didn't have a word for.

"He's good at this."

Eben turned. Wes had materialized beside him again. The man moved like a ghost.

"He is," Eben agreed, because there was no point denying it.

"You're good at different things."

"Yes."

"Complementary skills."

Eben gave him a look. Wes smiled.

"Just an observation," Wes said mildly.

"Observe quieter."

Wes's smile widened. He returned to his post behind the counter, leaving Eben alone with his thoughts.

Complementary skills. As if that explained anything. As if working well together was a reason toâ€”

To what?

Kiss in a cramped office and then spend the next twelve hours pretending it hadn't happened?

Eben closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them, Noel was looking at him.

Just for a second. Their gazes caught, held.

Then Noel looked away, and Eben felt the loss of it like a physical thing.

This was getting out of hand.

---

An hour into the competition, things were going well. No fires. No injuries. The postal worker's layer cake was already looking impressive, and the librarian's shortbread smelled like heaven.

Eben allowed himself to relax. Slightly.

That's when Hugh Everhart walked in.

Eben's relaxation died instantly.

Hugh was carrying a large box labeled *DECORATIVE SUPPLIES* in handwriting that looked vaguely threatening. He was also smiling, which was never a good sign.

"Delivery!" Hugh announced cheerfully.

Wes looked up from the counter. His expression shiftedâ€”subtle, but Eben caught it. Concern. Maybe resignation.

"Hugh," Wes said carefully. "We didn't orderâ€”"

"Extra supplies!" Hugh hoisted the box higher. "Thought you might need them. You know how these things go. Always running out of something."

He started toward the supply table.

Eben moved to intercept, but he was too far away.

Hugh set the box down.

The box tipped.

Everything after that happened very fast and also in slow motion.

The box fell. The contentsâ€”which appeared to be several bags of flour, because of course they wereâ€”tumbled out. One bag split on impact.

Then another.

Then all of them.

Flour exploded into the air like a small, powdery bomb.

Someone screamed.

The teenager's pie crust collapsed.

A contestant's fondant sculptureâ€”an elaborate swan that had taken an hour to buildâ€”toppled sideways and landed in someone else's mixing bowl.

Hugh stood in the center of the destruction, covered head to toe in white powder, looking delighted.

"Oops," he said.

The bakery went silent.

Then Noel started laughing.

Not polite laughter. Real, helpless, uncontrolled laughter that echoed through the flour-hazed air.

Eben looked at him.

Noel was covered in flour. Hair, face, shouldersâ€”everything. He looked ridiculous. He lookedâ€”

Beautiful.

The thought arrived uninvited and refused to leave.

Eben became aware that he, too, was covered in flour. He could feel it on his face, in his hair, coating his usually immaculate clothes.

Noel met his eyes across the bakery.

For one long, suspended moment, neither of them moved.

Then Noel grinnedâ€”wide, genuine, devastatingâ€”and Eben felt something in his chest crack open.

This was definitely a problem.
# Chapter 3: Flour Chaos

**[Noel]**

The bakery looked like a snow globe had exploded.

Everything was white. The floor, the counters, the contestantsâ€”everyone and everything coated in a fine layer of flour that hung in the air like fog.

Hugh stood in the epicenter, somehow managing to look both apologetic and pleased with himself.

"Well," he said brightly. "That's one way to add atmosphere."

Wes closed his eyes. "Everyone's fired."

He didn't mean it. Probably. Wes had the patience of a saint, which was good, because Hugh tested it approximately once a week.

Noel tried to stop laughing. Failed. Tried again.

"I'm sorry," he managed, wiping his eyes and immediately regretting it when flour dust made everything worse. "I'm sorry, this isn't funnyâ€”"

"It's a little funny," the teenager said. She was staring at the ruins of her pie crust with the resignation of someone who'd seen worse.

"It's not funny," the woman whose fondant swan had died said. Then she looked at the swanâ€”now a shapeless blob in someone else's batterâ€”and snorted. "Okay, it's a little funny."

The tension broke.

People started laughing. Brushing flour off themselves and each other. Assessing the damage with the kind of good humor that only came from shared disaster.

Noel looked around for Eben.

Found him immediately, because apparently Noel's brain had installed some kind of Eben-tracking system without permission.

Eben was covered in flour. Completely covered. It was in his dark hair, on his face, coating his usually pristine jacket. He looked... rumpled. Human. Approachable.

He looked at Noel.

Noel's laughter died in his throat.

They were both ridiculous. Standing in a flour-bombed bakery, covered in white powder, surrounded by chaos. It should have been absurd.

It didn't feel absurd.

It felt like something else entirely.

Eben's expression shiftedâ€”something unguarded flickering across his face before he locked it down again.

Then he did something Noel had never seen before.

He almost smiled.

Not quite. Just the barest hint of it, gone so fast Noel might have imagined it. But it had been there. Real. Devastating.

Noel's heart did something complicated in his chest.

"Right," Wes said, breaking the moment. "Let's assess the damage."

---

**[Eben]**

The damage was extensive but not catastrophic.

Three contestants needed to start over completely. Five could salvage their work with modifications. Four were miraculously unaffected, having been far enough from the blast radius to escape.

Hugh was banished to the corner with a broom and a look from Wes that could have frozen lava.

Eben helped coordinate the cleanup. Distributed fresh ingredients. Adjusted timers to account for the delay. Fell back into the familiar rhythm of problem-solving.

It helped. Slightly.

What didn't help was Noel working beside him, still covered in flour, still smiling like the disaster had been the best thing to happen all day.

"You have flour in your hair," Noel said.

Eben resisted the urge to check. "You have flour on your face."

"We both look ridiculous."

"Yes."

A pause. Noel's smile widened.

"Why are you smiling?" Eben asked before he could stop himself.

"I'm not. That's the flour."

It wasn't the flour.

Eben turned back to the supply inventory before he could do something inadvisable. Like smile back.

---

**[Noel]**

The bake-off resumed with the kind of determined energy that came from refusing to let chaos win.

Noel made his rounds, checking on contestants, offering encouragement. The postal worker's layer cake had survived intact. The librarian's shortbread was already in the oven, filling the air with butter and sugar. Even the teenager had managed to salvage her pie crust, though she'd had to start the lattice work over from scratch.

"You're good at this," someone said.

Noel turned. One of the first-time bakersâ€”a young man who'd been on the verge of tears when his mixing bowl had been flour-bombedâ€”was watching him with something like gratitude.

"At what?" Noel asked.

"Making it feel okay. When things go wrong."

Noel blinked. "Oh. Iâ€”thank you?"

The man smiled and returned to his station.

Noel stood there, caught off-guard by the simple kindness of it.

He was used to being useful. Used to fixing things, smoothing things over, making sure everyone else was okay. He wasn't used to people noticing. Or if they noticed, they didn't usually say anything.

It felt... nice.

He glanced across the bakery. Eben was crouched beside a nervous-looking older woman, talking her through something with her dough. His voice was too low to hear, but his posture was patient. Calm.

The woman nodded, tried whatever he'd suggested, and her face lit up when it worked.

Eben stood, brushed flour off his knees, and moved to the next person who needed help.

He didn't make a show of it. Didn't draw attention to himself. Just quietly, efficiently made sure everyone had what they needed.

Noel's chest did that complicated thing again.

*Great. Perfect. Emotionally unavailable glacier man was also secretly kind. This was fine. He was fine.*

He was absolutely not fine.

---

**[Eben]**

The older womanâ€”Mrs. Chen, according to her name tagâ€”had been on the verge of giving up.

Her pie dough had been too dry, crumbling apart every time she tried to roll it. The flour explosion had only made things worse, and she'd been standing at her station with the kind of defeated slump that Eben recognized.

He'd seen it before. In himself, years ago, when everything had fallen apart and he'd had to rebuild from nothing.

So he'd stopped. Crouched beside her. Talked her through adding water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough came together.

"There," he'd said when she'd successfully rolled it out. "Perfect."

She'd smiled at himâ€”warm, gratefulâ€”and Eben had felt something unfamiliar stir in his chest.

He'd forgotten what it felt like to help someone without expecting anything in return.

He stood, brushed off his knees, and turned.

Noel was watching him from across the bakery.

Eben froze.

Noel's expression was... soft. Open. Like he'd just seen something that mattered.

Their eyes held for one beat too long.

Then Noel looked away, and Eben forced himself to move to the next station.

But he could still feel the weight of that gaze.

Could still feel the way something had shifted between them in that moment.

This was getting dangerous.

---

**[Noel]**

By four o'clock, the bake-off was back on track.

The kitchen smelled incredibleâ€”sugar and chocolate and cinnamon and butter, all mixing together into something that made Noel's stomach growl. He hadn't eaten since breakfast. Hadn't even thought about food, too busy managing chaos and trying not to stare at Eben.

The contestants were in the final stretch now. Decorating, plating, adding finishing touches. The teenager's pie looked like something from a magazine. The postal worker's layer cake was a work of art. Even Mrs. Chen's pieâ€”the one that had almost failedâ€”was golden and perfect.

Wes moved through the space with quiet authority, checking progress, offering gentle suggestions. He caught Noel's eye and nodded toward the back room.

Noel followed.

"You did well," Wes said once they were alone.

"Hugh caused a flour explosion."

"And you kept everyone calm." Wes's smile was knowing. "That's a skill."

"I justâ€”" Noel shrugged. "I don't know. Tried to help."

"You did more than that." Wes studied him for a moment. "You made people feel like it was okay to fail. That's rare."

Noel didn't know what to say to that.

Wes's expression softened. "You're allowed to accept a compliment, you know."

"I know."

"Do you?"

Before Noel could answer, a timer went off in the main room. Wes patted his shoulder and headed back out.

Noel stayed in the back room for another moment, trying to process.

He was good at this. At helping. At making people feel okay.

But was that enough?

Was being useful the same as being wanted?

He didn't know.

He was afraid to find out.

---

**[Dual]**

The bake-off ended at five.

Wes rang his bellâ€”two cheerful chimesâ€”and the contestants stepped back from their creations with the exhausted satisfaction of people who'd survived something.

The judging was quick. Wes, Noel, and Eben sampled everything, took notes, conferred quietly.

The teenager won. Again. Her pie was perfectâ€”flaky crust, spiced filling, lattice work that looked like lace.

She accepted her ribbon with a grin that suggested she'd known all along.

The postal worker came in second. Mrs. Chen got an honorable mention for "most improved under pressure," which made her tear up.

Hugh was not allowed to participate in judging. He was still in the corner with his broom, looking appropriately chastened.

As the contestants packed up and filtered out, Noel and Eben found themselves standing side by side near the counter.

"We did it," Noel said.

"We did."

Their first real conversation since the kiss.

It felt monumental and inadequate all at once.

"Despite the flour," Noel added.

"Because of the flour," Eben corrected. "It brought people together."

Noel looked at him. Eben's expression was dry, but there was something in his eyesâ€”something almost playful.

Was that a joke?

Had Eben Frost just made a joke?

Noel felt his smile grow. "Did you justâ€”"

"No."

"You did. You made a joke."

"I stated a fact."

"A funny fact."

Eben's mouth twitched. "If you say so."

They stood there, covered in flour, surrounded by the warm smell of baking and the quiet satisfaction of a job well done.

Something was waiting between them. Something that had started in a tiny office and was now demanding attention.

Noel took a breath.

"Ebenâ€”"

"Get home safe, you two," Wes called from behind the counter.

The way he said *you two* made it sound like a single unit.

Noel's words died.

Eben's jaw tightened.

They walked out into the cold together, and neither of them said what they were both thinking.
# Chapter 4: Quiet Kindness

The back room of Candle & Crumb was quieter than the main bakery.

Noel had ducked in to grab more napkinsâ€”or that's what he'd told himself. Really, he'd needed a moment. A breath. Space to think about the fact that he and Eben had just had an almost-normal conversation and Noel's entire nervous system was still processing it.

He found the napkins. Stood there holding them like they might contain answers.

They didn't.

Through the partially open door, he could hear the bakery winding down. Contestants chatting, packing up their things. Wes's calm voice directing cleanup. The comfortable sounds of an event ending well.

Then he heard something else.

A younger voice, shaky. On the edge of tears.

"I can'tâ€” It's not working. I don't know what I'm doing wrong."

Noel moved closer to the door.

In the main room, one of the contestantsâ€”the nervous young man from earlierâ€”was standing at his station, staring at a collapsed pastry with the kind of despair usually reserved for actual tragedies.

Eben was there.

Noel watched as Eben set down whatever he'd been carrying and moved to the young man's side. Not hovering. Just... present.

"What happened?" Eben asked. His voice was different. Softer than Noel had ever heard it.

"I don't know." The young man's hands were shaking. "I followed the recipe exactly, but it justâ€”it fell apart. Everything I make falls apart."

There was more than pastry failure in those words.

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then he crouched downâ€”actually crouchedâ€”so he was at eye level with the ruined dessert.

"Show me what you did," he said.

The young man walked him through it. Eben listened. Didn't interrupt. Didn't judge. Just listened with the kind of attention that made it clear he actually cared about the answer.

"There," Eben said when the explanation finished. "You over-mixed. See how the batter's dense? That's gluten development. For this recipe, you want to fold, not stir."

"I don't know how to fold."

"I'll show you."

And he did.

Noel stood in the doorway, frozen, as Eben Frostâ€”controlled, distant, emotionally unavailable Eben Frostâ€”patiently walked a stranger through the mechanics of folding batter. His hands moved with careful precision, demonstrating the motion. His voice stayed gentle, encouraging.

"Like this. See? Light touch. You're not forcing it. You're coaxing it."

The young man tried. Failed. Tried again.

"Better," Eben said. "Keep going."

Three attempts later, the batter came together properly. The young man stared at it like it had performed a miracle.

"I did it."

"You did."

"I actuallyâ€”" The young man's voice cracked. "Thank you. I know it's just baking, butâ€”"

"It's not just baking," Eben said quietly. "It's proof that you can learn. That you can try something difficult and succeed. That matters."

The young man nodded, blinking rapidly.

Eben stood, brushed flour off his knees, and rested a hand briefly on the young man's shoulder. "You'll be fine."

Then he moved away, back to whatever task he'd been doing before, like he hadn't just completely rewired Noel's understanding of who he was.

Noel stood in the doorway, napkins forgotten, heart doing acrobatics.

*Oh no.*

---

This was bad.

This was very bad.

Noel had been managing, barely, when Eben was just attractive and competent and occasionally almost-funny. He could handle that. He could keep it professional, keep it temporary, keep it from meaning anything.

But this?

Eben being *kind*â€”genuinely, quietly kind, in a way that expected nothing in return?

Noel's defenses didn't stand a chance.

He forced himself to move. Walked back into the main bakery with the napkins, set them on the counter, tried to look normal.

Eben glanced up. Their eyes met.

Noel looked away so fast he nearly gave himself whiplash.

*Professional. Be professional. Do not think about the way he crouched down to help that kid. Do not think about his voice going soft. Do notâ€”*

"Noel?"

Wes was beside him, looking concerned.

"You okay? You look a little..."

"Fine," Noel said automatically. "I'm fine."

Wes's expression suggested he didn't believe that for a second, but he didn't push. Just handed Noel a cup of water and moved on.

Noel drank it. Tried to think.

This was temporary. The partnership, the festival, whatever was happening between themâ€”all of it was temporary. Eben would leave after Christmas. Noel would stay. That was the plan.

That had always been the plan.

So it didn't matter that Eben was kind. It didn't matter that he'd helped a stranger with the same careful attention he brought to everything. It didn't matter that Noel had just witnessed something that made his chest ache.

None of it mattered.

Noel repeated this to himself several times.

His heart didn't listen.

---

The bakery emptied slowly.

Contestants left with their creationsâ€”winners and losers alike, all smiling, all covered in varying amounts of flour. Hugh finished sweeping and escaped before Wes could assign him additional penance. The young man Eben had helped waved goodbye with something like hope on his face.

Soon it was just Noel, Eben, and Wes.

"You two did well today," Wes said, wiping down the counter. "Despite the chaos."

"Hugh's chaos," Noel corrected.

"Hugh's chaos," Wes agreed. "But you handled it. Both of you."

He said it casually, but there was weight behind the words. Acknowledgment. Approval.

Noel felt something warm settle in his chest.

"We should go," Eben said. He was pulling on his coat, careful and methodical. "Let you close up."

"I'm in no rush." Wes's smile was knowing. "But yes, you should probably go. Together, ideally."

There it was again. That pointed emphasis.

Noel shot him a look. Wes's smile didn't waver.

"Come on," Eben said quietly.

Noel followed him out into the cold.

---

The sun was setting. The sky had gone pink and gold, the kind of winter sunset that made everything look softer. Snow was starting to fallâ€”light, lazy flakes that caught the streetlights.

Tinsel Town was beautiful like this. Quiet. Peaceful.

Noel couldn't appreciate any of it.

He was too busy being hyperaware of Eben walking beside him. Close enough that their shoulders almost brushed. Far enough that they weren't quite touching.

Neither of them spoke.

The silence stretched, loaded with everything they weren't saying.

Noel's apartment was in the opposite direction from Eben's rental. They both knew this. They were walking the same direction anyway.

Noel should say something. Should address it. Shouldâ€”

"You were good with him," Noel said before he could stop himself.

Eben glanced over. "Who?"

"The kid. The one whose pastry collapsed."

"Oh." Eben's expression shuttered slightly. "He just needed guidance."

"You were patient."

"It wasn't difficult."

"It was kind."

Eben stopped walking.

Noel stopped too, heart suddenly racing.

They stood on the quiet street, snow falling around them, and looked at each other.

"It wasn'tâ€”" Eben started, then stopped. His jaw tightened. "I just helped him. That's all."

"That's not all," Noel said softly.

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. Uncertainty. Vulnerability. Gone before Noel could name it.

"We should keep moving," Eben said. "It's cold."

He started walking again.

Noel followed, chest tight.

*Great. Perfect. Emotionally unavailable glacier man was also secretly kind. Noel's type, apparently, was 'everything he thought he didn't want, served in one devastating package.'*

He was in so much trouble.

---

They walked in silence for another block.

The streets were emptying as people headed home for dinner. Lights glowed in windows. Somewhere, someone was playing Christmas musicâ€”faint, cheerful, incongruous with the tension humming between them.

Noel's mind was racing.

He kept replaying the moment in the bakery. Eben crouching down. His voice going soft. The way he'd made that young man feel capable, valued, seen.

The way Noel wantedâ€”desperately, dangerouslyâ€”to be on the receiving end of that attention.

*Stop. This doesn't matter. It was one kiss.*

*A really good kiss.*

*That didn't matter either.*

Except it did.

It mattered that Eben was kind. It mattered that he helped people without expecting anything in return. It mattered that beneath the controlled exterior was someone who cared, even if he didn't want to admit it.

It mattered that Noel was falling for him.

The thought arrived fully formed, undeniable.

Noel stumbled.

Eben's hand shot out, steadying him.

"Careful."

His grip was firm. Warm through Noel's coat.

Noel looked up. Met Eben's eyes.

They were standing too close. Close enough that Noel could see the flour still dusting Eben's hair. Close enough to count the shades of gray in his eyes.

Close enough to kiss.

Eben's hand was still on his arm.

Neither of them moved.

"Noel," Eben said quietly.

It wasn't a question. It wasn't a statement. It was just his name, said in a voice that made Noel's breath catch.

The moment stretched.

Then Eben let go and stepped back.

"We shouldâ€”" He cleared his throat. "The bake-off. Tomorrow. We need to coordinate."

Right. Work. Professional things.

"Right," Noel managed. "Tomorrow."

They started walking again.

But something had shifted.

Something was building between them, inevitable and terrifying, and Noel didn't know how to stop it.

Wasn't sure he wanted to.
# Chapter 5: The Win

**[Dual - Eben]**

They'd succeeded.

Despite Hugh's flour disaster, despite the collapsed pastries and ruined fondant and general chaos, the bake-off had been a success. The contestants had left happy. Wes had looked pleased. The festival had another event checked off the list.

Eben should feel satisfied.

Instead, he felt off-balance.

It was Noel's fault.

Everything lately was Noel's fault, which wasn't fair, but Eben's capacity for fairness had been compromised somewhere around the moment Noel had looked at him in that flour-covered bakery and smiled like Eben had done something remarkable.

He hadn't. He'd just helped someone. It wasn't complicated.

Except Noel had made it feel complicated.

Had made it feel like it *mattered*.

Eben didn't know what to do with that.

They were walking through Tinsel Town's evening streets, snow falling in lazy spirals, neither speaking. The silence should have been comfortable. Professional.

It wasn't.

It was charged. Waiting.

Eben could feel the weight of everything unsaid pressing against his ribs.

"We did it," Noel said suddenly.

Eben glanced over. "We did."

"Despite everything."

"Because of everything," Eben corrected. "The chaos brought people together."

Noel's expression shiftedâ€”surprise, then something softer. "That's very optimistic of you."

"I'm not optimistic."

"You just said chaos brought people together. That's practically a motivational poster."

Eben's mouth twitched. "It's an observation."

"A positive observation."

"Don't get used to it."

Noel laughedâ€”quiet, genuineâ€”and Eben felt the sound settle somewhere dangerous in his chest.

This was their first real conversation since the kiss.

It felt monumental and inadequate all at once.

---

**[Dual - Noel]**

They were talking.

Actually talking, not just coordinating logistics or avoiding eye contact. Talking like two people who might actually like each other.

Noel didn't know what to do with this information.

"You were good today," he said, because apparently he'd decided honesty was the way forward. "With the contestants. With... everything."

Eben's expression shuttered slightly. "So were you."

"I'm always good with people. That's my job."

"It's more than your job."

Noel blinked. "What?"

"You care." Eben said it simply, like it was obvious. "About everyone. Constantly. It's not performance."

Something warm and fragile bloomed in Noel's chest.

"Oh," he managed.

They walked in silence for another moment. The snow was picking up, dusting their shoulders, catching in Eben's dark hair.

Noel wanted to reach out and brush it away.

He didn't.

"Ebenâ€”"

"We should talk about it," Eben said at the same time.

They both stopped walking.

Looked at each other.

"The kiss," Eben clarified, even though they both knew exactly what he meant.

Noel's heart was suddenly very loud. "We probably should."

"Probably."

Neither of them talked about it.

The moment stretched, heavy with possibility.

Then Eben's phone rang.

---

**[Dual - Eben]**

Of course it did.

Eben pulled out his phone, saw the mayor's name, and briefly considered throwing the device into a snowbank.

"I shouldâ€”"

"Take it," Noel said. "It's fine."

It wasn't fine.

Eben answered. "Frost."

Mayor Kringle's voice was anxious, as always. Something about vendor permits and scheduling conflicts and could Eben please review the updated timeline because she was worried they were falling behindâ€”

"I'll look at it tonight," Eben said, cutting through the spiral. "Send me the file."

"Oh, thank you, I knew I could count on you, you're so reliableâ€”"

Eben ended the call.

Looked at Noel.

Noel was watching him with an expression Eben couldn't quite read.

"Work," Eben said unnecessarily.

"I gathered." Noel's smile was small. "You're very in-demand."

"The mayor is anxious."

"The mayor is always anxious. You're good at managing it."

There it was again. That simple acknowledgment. Like Eben's competence was something worth noticing.

Like *he* was something worth noticing.

Eben didn't know what to do with that either.

---

**[Dual - Noel]**

They started walking again.

The conversation had been interrupted, but something had shifted. The air between them felt different. Less tense. More... open.

Noel took a breath.

"About the kiss," he said.

Eben went very still.

"I don'tâ€”" Noel stopped. Started again. "I don't want to pretend it didn't happen."

"Neither do I."

The admission hung between them.

"But I don't know what it means," Noel continued. "Or what you want it to mean. Or ifâ€”"

"I don't know either," Eben said quietly.

They looked at each other.

Snow fell around them. The street was empty, the town settling into evening quiet. Somewhere, a church bell chimed six times.

"I should go," Eben said. He didn't move.

"Yeah," Noel agreed. He didn't move either.

The space between them felt impossibly small and impossibly vast all at once.

"Tomorrow," Eben said finally.

"Tomorrow," Noel echoed.

Eben turned to leave.

"Eben."

He stopped. Looked back.

Noel's heart was racing. "I'm glad we're doing this. The festival. Together."

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. "So am I."

Then he walked away, and Noel stood in the falling snow, watching him go.

---

**[Dual - Eben]**

Eben made it three blocks before he stopped.

Stood on the quiet street, snow falling, hands in his pockets.

He should go home. Review the mayor's timeline. Prepare for tomorrow. Do all the responsible, professional things he was supposed to do.

Instead, he stood there and thought about Noel.

About the way Noel had looked at him in the bakery. About the conversation they'd just hadâ€”halting, incomplete, but *real*. About the fact that Eben had almost told him the truth.

*I don't know what this means, but I want to find out.*

He hadn't said it.

But he'd wanted to.

That was dangerous.

Eben had spent years building walls. Keeping people at a distance. Protecting himself from the kind of attachment that destroyed things.

Noel was dismantling those walls without even trying.

Just by being kind. By caring. By looking at Eben like he was someone worth knowing.

Eben closed his eyes.

This was supposed to be temporary.

It didn't feel temporary.

It felt like the start of something.

And that terrified him.

---

**[Dual - Noel]**

Noel walked home slowly.

His apartment was small, warm, cluttered with the organized chaos of someone who worked too much and slept too little. He dropped his coat on the chair. Made tea he didn't drink. Stood at the window and looked out at the snow.

He kept replaying the conversation.

*I don't want to pretend it didn't happen.*

*Neither do I.*

It wasn't a declaration. It wasn't a plan. It was just... honesty.

And somehow, that felt more significant than anything else.

Noel touched his lips.

He was falling for Eben Frost.

Maybe had already fallen.

That was terrifying and exhilarating and completely inadvisable, and Noel didn't know what to do about it.

Exceptâ€”

Except maybe he didn't have to do anything. Maybe he could just... let it happen. See where it went. Stop trying to control everything and just *feel*.

The thought was radical.

Also possibly stupid.

But standing in his apartment, alone, thinking about the way Eben had looked at him in the snowâ€”

Noel thought maybe stupid was worth it.

---

**[Dual - Eben]**

Eben's rental was cold when he got home.

He turned up the heat. Made coffee. Opened his laptop.

His phone buzzed.

**Noel:** *Thanks for today. For helping that kid. For being patient. For... everything.*

**Eben:** *You're welcome.*

**Noel:** *See you tomorrow?*

**Eben:** *Yes.*

He set the phone down.

Tomorrow.

That felt like enough.
# Chapter 6: The Walk

The next day started normal.

Noel arrived at Merryweather Hall. Checked his emails. Coordinated with vendors. Did all the professional, competent things he was supposed to do.

Eben was there. Also being professional. Also being competent.

They nodded at each other across the hall.

It was very mature.

It lasted approximately two hours.

---

At ten-thirty, Noel's phone buzzed.

**Eben:** *Need to check the lighting setup at Evergreen Square. Want to come?*

Noel stared at the message.

It was a work request. Completely reasonable. They were co-managing the festival. Of course they'd need to coordinate on-site.

Except.

Except it felt like more than that.

**Noel:** *Sure. Meet you there?*

**Eben:** *I'll walk with you.*

Noel's heart did something complicated.

*Professional. This is professional.*

He grabbed his coat.

---

They walked through Tinsel Town in silence.

It wasn't the tense silence from yesterday. It was something else. Something almost comfortable, if comfort could coexist with the constant awareness of another person's presence.

Noel was hyperaware of Eben beside him. The way he moved. The way his breath fogged in the cold air. The way their shoulders almost brushed with every step.

"You're quiet," Eben observed.

"Thinking."

"About?"

*You. Always you. The kiss. What happens next. Whether I'm reading this completely wrong.*

"Work," Noel said.

Eben's expression suggested he didn't believe that, but he didn't push.

They reached Evergreen Square. The main festival space was already taking shapeâ€”vendor booths, string lights, a small stage for performances. It looked magical, even half-finished.

Eben pulled out a tablet, started checking measurements against the plan.

Noel watched him work.

"The lights need to be higher," Eben said, pointing to a strand that was sagging. "And that booth is three feet off-center."

"You measured that by looking?"

"Yes."

"That's unsettling."

Eben's mouth twitched. "It's efficient."

"It's unsettling efficiency."

This time, Eben almost smiled. "I'll take that as a compliment."

"You would."

They fell into an easy rhythmâ€”Eben identifying problems, Noel coordinating solutions. It was the same dynamic they'd had since the beginning, but something about it felt different now. Less adversarial. More... partnership.

Noel liked it.

Liked it more than was probably safe.

---

An hour later, the square was sorted.

Lights adjusted. Booths realigned. Everything exactly as it should be.

They stood in the center of the space, surrounded by twinkling lights and the smell of pine, and Noel realized he didn't want to leave.

"We should head back," Eben said.

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

The square was quiet. Most of the vendors had left for lunch. It was just them, standing in the cold, snow starting to fall again.

"Noel."

Eben's voice was different. Softer.

Noel looked at him.

Eben was watching him with an expression Noel couldn't quite read. Something careful. Something vulnerable.

"Last night," Eben started. "When I said I didn't know what this meantâ€”"

"I know."

"I wasn'tâ€”" Eben stopped. Took a breath. "I wasn't lying. I don't know. But Iâ€”"

He stopped again.

Noel waited.

The snow fell around them. The lights twinkled. The world felt very small and very large all at once.

"I want to find out," Eben said finally.

Noel's breath caught.

"What?"

"I want to find out what this means." Eben's jaw was tight, like the admission cost him something. "If youâ€”if that's something you want."

Noel stared at him.

Eben Frost, controlled and careful and emotionally unavailable, was standing in the middle of Evergreen Square asking if Noel wanted to see where this went.

"Yes," Noel said. "Yes, I want that."

Something in Eben's expression eased.

"Okay."

"Okay."

They stood there, looking at each other, and Noel felt like something fundamental had just shifted.

---

They walked back to the hall together.

Didn't talk about what had just happened. Didn't define it or analyze it or make plans.

Just walked, close enough that their hands almost touched, and let the possibility of it settle between them.

When they reached Merryweather Hall, Eben stopped.

"Tonight," he said. "After work. Do you want toâ€”"

"Yes."

Eben blinked. "I didn't finish the question."

"Doesn't matter. The answer is yes."

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. Almost amusement. Almost fondness.

"Seven o'clock," he said. "I'll meet you here."

"Okay."

Eben nodded once and walked inside.

Noel stood in the cold, heart racing.

They were doing this.

Whatever *this* was.

---

At seven o'clock exactly, Eben appeared.

He'd changedâ€”not into anything fancy, just a different jacket, cleaner boots. But the effort was there. Visible.

They walked.

The town was beautiful in the evening. Lights everywhere, snow falling gently, the kind of picture-perfect winter scene that belonged on a postcard.

They turned down a quieter street. Fewer lights here. More shadows.

"Noel," Eben said.

His voice was rough. Careful.

Noel's heart was racing.

"Yeah?"

"I want to kiss you again."

The world narrowed to just them.

"Yes. Please."

Eben stepped closer.

Eben kissed him.

It was different from the first time. Slower. More deliberate. Like Eben was trying to memorize the moment.

Noel kissed back, hands fisting in Eben's jacket, and felt something in his chest crack open.

This was real.

This was happening.

When they pulled apart, they were both breathing hard.

Snow fell around them. The street was empty. The night was just beginning.

And everything had changed.
