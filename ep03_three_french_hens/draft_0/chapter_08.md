# Chapter 8: Afterglow

Eben woke to pale morning light and the unfamiliar weight of another person beside him.

For a moment, he didn't move. Just lay there, processing.

Noel's apartment. Noel's bed.

Noel, still asleep, curled against his side like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Eben's chest tightened.

He should leave. Should extract himself carefully, get dressed, go back to his rental before this became more complicated than it already was.

He didn't move.

Noel shifted in his sleep, made a small sound, and settled closer.

Eben closed his eyes.

*What am I doing?*

---

Last night had been—

Eben didn't have words for what last night had been.

Intense. Overwhelming. Perfect.

Terrifying.

He'd meant to keep it simple. Physical. Something they could both walk away from when the festival ended and Eben left Tinsel Town for the next temporary job.

But lying here, with Noel warm and trusting against him, Eben knew it was too late for simple.

This meant something.

*He* meant something.

And that was the problem.

---

Noel stirred.

Eben felt the moment he woke—the slight tension, the shift from sleep to awareness.

"Morning," Noel mumbled against his shoulder.

"Morning."

A pause. Then Noel lifted his head, blinking sleep from his eyes.

He looked rumpled. Soft. Beautiful in the early light.

Eben's heart did something complicated.

"You stayed," Noel said.

"I did."

"I wasn't sure you would."

The honesty in those words hurt.

"I said I would," Eben said quietly.

"I know. I just—" Noel stopped. Looked away. "People don't usually stay."

Eben understood, suddenly, that this wasn't just about him. That Noel had been left before. Had learned not to expect permanence.

"I'm here," Eben said.

Noel looked at him. Something vulnerable flickered in his eyes.

"For how long?"

The question hung between them.

Eben didn't have an answer.

"I don't know," he admitted.

Noel nodded. Like he'd expected that. Like he'd been bracing for it.

"Right," he said. "Temporary."

The word felt wrong.

Everything about this felt wrong.

Not the being here. Not the waking up beside Noel. But the fact that Eben didn't know how to make it anything other than temporary.

Didn't know if he was capable of more.

---

They lay in silence for a moment.

Outside, Tinsel Town was waking up. Eben could hear the faint sounds of morning—footsteps on snow, a car starting, someone calling a greeting.

Normal sounds. Normal morning.

Nothing about this felt normal.

"I should—" Eben started.

"Yeah," Noel said quickly. "You probably have work. Things to do. I get it."

He was pulling away. Emotionally, if not physically. Eben could feel it.

"Noel—"

"It's fine. Really. Last night was—it was good. Great. But I know what this is. Temporary. No expectations."

The words were light. Casual.

They didn't match the tension in Noel's shoulders.

Eben sat up. Noel did too, putting careful distance between them.

"I don't—" Eben stopped. Started again. "I don't know how to do this."

"Do what?"

"This. Whatever this is. I don't—I'm not good at staying. At letting people in. At—"

"Attachment," Noel finished quietly.

Eben looked at him.

Noel's expression was understanding. Sad.

"I know," Noel said. "You told me. Attachment destroys things."

"In my experience, yes."

"So what was last night?"

The question was gentle. Not accusatory. Just... honest.

Eben didn't know how to answer.

"I don't know," he said finally. "But it wasn't nothing."

"No," Noel agreed. "It wasn't nothing."

They looked at each other.

The morning light made everything feel too real. Too exposed.

"I should go," Eben said.

"Okay."

Neither of them moved.

"Unless—" Eben stopped.

"Unless what?"

"Unless you want me to stay. For coffee. Or—"

"Do you want to stay?" Noel asked.

Eben looked at him. At the careful hope in his eyes. At the way he was trying not to expect anything.

"Yes," Eben said. "I want to stay."

Noel's expression softened. "Okay. Then stay."

---

They made coffee together.

It was domestic. Comfortable. Noel moved around his small kitchen with easy familiarity, and Eben found himself watching. Learning the rhythms of Noel's morning routine.

The way he hummed while the coffee brewed. The way he pulled two mugs from the cabinet without asking if Eben wanted any. The way he added sugar to his own cup—two spoonfuls, precise—and left Eben's black.

"How did you know I take it black?" Eben asked.

Noel glanced over. "You ordered it black at the Garland Cup. First day we met."

"You remember that?"

"I remember a lot of things."

The admission hung between them.

Eben took the offered mug. Their fingers brushed.

Neither of them pulled away.

"Thank you," Eben said.

"For the coffee?"

"For—" Eben stopped. "For last night. For this. For not making it complicated."

Noel's smile was small. Sad. "It's already complicated."

"I know."

"But we're doing it anyway."

"Yes."

They stood in Noel's small kitchen, drinking coffee, and Eben felt something settle in his chest.

This was dangerous.

This was exactly the kind of attachment he'd spent years avoiding.

But standing here, with Noel looking at him like he was something worth keeping—

Eben thought maybe dangerous was worth it.

---

"I have to go," Eben said eventually.

They'd finished their coffee. The morning was progressing. Work was waiting.

"I know," Noel said.

Eben set his mug in the sink. Started gathering his things—coat, scarf, the pieces of himself he'd left scattered around Noel's apartment.

Noel watched from the doorway.

"Eben?"

Eben turned.

Noel was backlit by the morning sun, and for a moment, Eben couldn't breathe.

"Yeah?"

"Are we—" Noel stopped. Started again. "What are we doing?"

It was the question Eben had been avoiding.

"I don't know," he said honestly.

"Do you want to figure it out?"

Eben looked at him. At the vulnerability in his expression. At the way he was asking for something without demanding it.

"Yes," Eben said. "I want to figure it out."

Noel's smile was small. Genuine. "Okay."

"Okay."

Eben crossed the space between them. Kissed Noel—brief, loaded with everything he couldn't say.

When he pulled back, Noel's eyes were soft.

"Tomorrow?" Noel asked.

"Tomorrow," Eben agreed.

He left before he could change his mind.

---

The walk back to his rental was cold.

Eben barely felt it.

His mind was too busy processing. Analyzing. Trying to make sense of what had just happened.

He'd stayed the night.

He'd had coffee with Noel.

He'd agreed to figure this out.

All things he'd sworn he wouldn't do.

All things that felt terrifyingly right.

Eben reached his rental, let himself in, stood in the empty space.

It felt wrong now. Too quiet. Too impersonal.

Not like Noel's apartment, which had been warm and lived-in and full of small details that told stories.

Eben sat on the edge of the bed.

Pulled out his phone.

Stared at it for a long moment.

Then he typed a message.

**Eben:** *Thank you for last night.*

He hit send before he could overthink it.

The response came almost immediately.

**Noel:** *Thank you for staying.*

Eben stared at the message.

Something in his chest cracked open.

He typed another message.

**Eben:** *I meant what I said. I want to figure this out.*

**Noel:** *Me too.*

**Eben:** *I don't know how.*

**Noel:** *We'll learn.*

Eben closed his eyes.

*We'll learn.*

As if it were that simple.

As if wanting something was enough to make it work.

Eben had never believed that before.

But sitting in his empty rental, thinking about Noel's smile and the way he'd said *stay* like it was the easiest thing in the world—

Eben thought maybe he wanted to believe it.

---

He spent the rest of the morning working.

Reviewed the mayor's timeline. Confirmed vendor schedules. Answered emails with his usual efficiency.

But his mind kept drifting.

To Noel. To last night. To the way it had felt to wake up beside someone and not immediately want to leave.

This was dangerous.

This was exactly what he'd been avoiding.

But it was also—

It was also the first time in years that Eben had felt like he was part of something. Connected to something. Like he mattered to someone beyond his competence and efficiency.

Noel saw him.

Really saw him.

And instead of being terrified by that—

Eben wanted more of it.

That was the most frightening thing of all.

---

At noon, his phone buzzed.

**Noel:** *Lunch? If you're not busy.*

Eben stared at the message.

He should say no. Should maintain distance. Should remember that this was temporary and getting more involved would only make it harder when he left.

He typed a response.

**Eben:** *Where?*

**Noel:** *Garland Cup? 12:30?*

**Eben:** *I'll be there.*

He set the phone down.

Looked around his empty rental.

Made a decision.

This was temporary. The job, the town, the partnership.

But maybe—just maybe—what he had with Noel didn't have to be.

Maybe he could try.

Maybe he could stay.

Maybe attachment didn't have to destroy things.

The thought was radical.

Also possibly stupid.

But Eben grabbed his coat and headed for the door anyway.

Because Noel had asked him to lunch.

And Eben wanted to say yes.

That felt like enough.

---

**[Final Line]**

Eben walked through Tinsel Town toward the Garland Cup, snow crunching under his boots, and didn't feel the cold.

He was too busy feeling everything else.
