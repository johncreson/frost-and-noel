# Chapter 6: The Walk

The next day started normal.

Noel arrived at Merryweather Hall. Checked his emails. Coordinated with vendors. Did all the professional, competent things he was supposed to do.

Eben was there. Also being professional. Also being competent.

They nodded at each other across the hall.

It was very mature.

It lasted approximately two hours.

---

At ten-thirty, Noel's phone buzzed.

**Eben:** *Need to check the lighting setup at Evergreen Square. Want to come?*

Noel stared at the message.

It was a work request. Completely reasonable. They were co-managing the festival. Of course they'd need to coordinate on-site.

Except.

Except it felt like more than that.

**Noel:** *Sure. Meet you there?*

**Eben:** *I'll walk with you.*

Noel's heart did something complicated.

*Professional. This is professional.*

He grabbed his coat.

---

They walked through Tinsel Town in silence.

It wasn't the tense silence from yesterday. It was something else. Something almost comfortable, if comfort could coexist with the constant awareness of another person's presence.

Noel was hyperaware of Eben beside him. The way he moved. The way his breath fogged in the cold air. The way their shoulders almost brushed with every step.

"You're quiet," Eben observed.

"Thinking."

"About?"

*You. Always you. The kiss. What happens next. Whether I'm reading this completely wrong.*

"Work," Noel said.

Eben's expression suggested he didn't believe that, but he didn't push.

They reached Evergreen Square. The main festival space was already taking shape—vendor booths, string lights, a small stage for performances. It looked magical, even half-finished.

Eben pulled out a tablet, started checking measurements against the plan.

Noel watched him work.

"The lights need to be higher," Eben said, pointing to a strand that was sagging. "And that booth is three feet off-center."

"You measured that by looking?"

"Yes."

"That's unsettling."

Eben's mouth twitched. "It's efficient."

"It's unsettling efficiency."

This time, Eben almost smiled. "I'll take that as a compliment."

"You would."

They fell into an easy rhythm—Eben identifying problems, Noel coordinating solutions. It was the same dynamic they'd had since the beginning, but something about it felt different now. Less adversarial. More... partnership.

Noel liked it.

Liked it more than was probably safe.

---

An hour later, the square was sorted.

Lights adjusted. Booths realigned. Everything exactly as it should be.

They stood in the center of the space, surrounded by twinkling lights and the smell of pine, and Noel realized he didn't want to leave.

"We should head back," Eben said.

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

The square was quiet. Most of the vendors had left for lunch. It was just them, standing in the cold, snow starting to fall again.

"Noel."

Eben's voice was different. Softer.

Noel looked at him.

Eben was watching him with an expression Noel couldn't quite read. Something careful. Something vulnerable.

"Last night," Eben started. "When I said I didn't know what this meant—"

"I know."

"I wasn't—" Eben stopped. Took a breath. "I wasn't lying. I don't know. But I—"

He stopped again.

Noel waited.

The snow fell around them. The lights twinkled. The world felt very small and very large all at once.

"I want to find out," Eben said finally.

Noel's breath caught.

"What?"

"I want to find out what this means." Eben's jaw was tight, like the admission cost him something. "If you—if that's something you want."

Noel stared at him.

Eben Frost, controlled and careful and emotionally unavailable, was standing in the middle of Evergreen Square asking if Noel wanted to see where this went.

"Yes," Noel said. "Yes, I want that."

Something in Eben's expression eased.

"Okay."

"Okay."

They stood there, looking at each other, and Noel felt like something fundamental had just shifted.

---

They walked back to the hall together.

Didn't talk about what had just happened. Didn't define it or analyze it or make plans.

Just walked, close enough that their hands almost touched, and let the possibility of it settle between them.

When they reached Merryweather Hall, Eben stopped.

"I have to review the vendor contracts," he said.

"I have to confirm the entertainment schedule."

"Right."

They stood there.

"Tonight," Eben said. "After work. Do you want to—"

"Yes."

Eben blinked. "I didn't finish the question."

"Doesn't matter. The answer is yes."

Something flickered in Eben's eyes. Almost amusement. Almost fondness.

"Seven o'clock," he said. "I'll meet you here."

"Okay."

Eben turned to leave, then stopped. Looked back.

"Noel."

"Yeah?"

"I'm—" He paused. "I'm glad we're doing this."

Noel's chest felt too full. "Me too."

Eben nodded once and walked inside.

Noel stood in the cold, heart racing, and tried to process what had just happened.

They were doing this.

Whatever *this* was.

He was terrified.

He was exhilarated.

He was completely, utterly in over his head.

And he didn't care.

---

The rest of the day passed in a blur.

Noel confirmed schedules. Answered emails. Coordinated with Hugh about decorations and only had to veto three glitter-related ideas.

The whole time, his mind was elsewhere.

Seven o'clock.

Eben had said seven o'clock.

Noel checked his watch approximately every five minutes.

At six-thirty, Wes appeared beside him.

"You're vibrating," Wes observed.

"I'm fine."

"You're vibrating with nervous energy. It's very obvious."

Noel gave him a look. "Don't you have a bakery to run?"

"Closed early." Wes's smile was knowing. "Thought I'd check on you. See how things are going."

"Things are fine."

"Mmm."

That sound again. Noel was starting to hate that sound.

"Wes—"

"I'm not going to pry," Wes said, which was definitely a lie. "I'm just going to say that whatever you're nervous about, you should probably just be honest about it."

"I am being honest."

"With yourself?"

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it.

Wes patted his shoulder. "Seven o'clock, right?"

"How did you—"

"I know everything." Wes's smile widened. "Have fun."

He left before Noel could respond.

Noel checked his watch.

Six forty-five.

He was definitely vibrating.

---

At seven o'clock exactly, Eben appeared.

He'd changed—not into anything fancy, just a different jacket, cleaner boots. But the effort was there. Visible.

Noel's heart did that complicated thing again.

"Hi," Noel said.

"Hi."

They stood there, suddenly awkward.

"So," Noel started. "What—"

"Walk?" Eben suggested.

"Yeah. Okay."

They walked.

The town was beautiful in the evening. Lights everywhere, snow falling gently, the kind of picture-perfect winter scene that belonged on a postcard.

Noel barely noticed.

He was too aware of Eben beside him. The silence between them. The weight of everything unsaid.

"I don't know how to do this," Noel admitted finally.

Eben glanced over. "Do what?"

"This. Whatever this is. I'm usually—I'm good at people. At knowing what to say. But with you, I—"

He stopped.

Eben was watching him with that careful attention that made Noel feel seen in a way that was both terrifying and exhilarating.

"I don't know how to do this either," Eben said quietly.

"Really?"

"Really."

They kept walking.

"So what do we do?" Noel asked.

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "We figure it out."

"Together?"

"Together."

Something in Noel's chest eased.

They turned down a quieter street. Fewer lights here. More shadows. The kind of place where conversations felt safer.

"Can I ask you something?" Noel said.

"Yes."

"Why did you come here? To Tinsel Town. Why did you take this job?"

Eben's expression shuttered slightly. "It was temporary."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the answer I have."

Noel let it sit. Didn't push.

After a moment, Eben continued. "I don't stay places. I don't—I'm not good at staying."

"Why not?"

"Because staying means attachment. And attachment—"

He stopped.

Noel waited.

"Attachment destroys things," Eben said finally. "In my experience."

The words landed heavy between them.

Noel understood, suddenly, why Eben kept everyone at a distance. Why he was so controlled. Why he'd tried so hard to pretend the kiss hadn't happened.

"I'm sorry," Noel said.

"Don't be."

"I am anyway."

Eben looked at him. Something vulnerable flickered in his eyes.

"I don't want to destroy this," he said quietly.

"You won't."

"You don't know that."

"I know you," Noel said. "You're careful. You're kind. You're—"

He stopped, suddenly aware of how much he was revealing.

Eben was very still.

"I'm what?" he asked softly.

Noel took a breath.

"You're someone I want to know," he said. "Really know. Not just the professional version. The real version."

The words hung between them.

Eben's expression did something complicated.

Then he stopped walking.

They were on a quiet street. Alone. Snow falling around them.

"Noel," Eben said.

His voice was rough. Careful.

Noel's heart was racing.

"Yeah?"

"I want to kiss you again."

The world narrowed to just them.

"Okay," Noel managed.

"Is that okay?"

"Yes. Please."

Eben stepped closer.

Noel stopped breathing.

"I don't know what this is," Eben said quietly. "Or where it's going. But I—"

"I want to," Noel interrupted. "Whatever happens next. I want to."

Eben's breath caught.

"You're sure?"

"I'm sure."

Eben kissed him.

It was different from the first time. Slower. More deliberate. Like Eben was trying to memorize the moment.

Noel kissed back, hands fisting in Eben's jacket, and felt something in his chest crack open.

This was real.

This was happening.

And Noel wanted it more than he'd wanted anything in a long time.

When they pulled apart, they were both breathing hard.

"Come home with me," Noel said.

Eben's eyes darkened.

"Are you sure?"

"I'm sure."

"Noel—"

"Please."

Eben closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them, they were full of something Noel couldn't name.

"Okay," he said.

They walked to Noel's apartment.

Neither of them said a word.

But their hands were clasped together, and that felt like enough.
