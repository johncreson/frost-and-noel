# Candle & Crumb Christmas
## A Tinsel Town Novella: Wes & Sam

*A cozy MM holiday romance about privacy, consent, boundaries, and learning to be seen*

---


Wes realized, with the slow dread of a man who was absolutely going to do something stupid, that Sam Rook did not look at him like a bakery owner.

Sam Rook looked at him like a problem worth solving.

And Wes Candle was so tired of being the one who fixed everything.

Sam didn’t touch anything at first. He just stood there in the entryway, eyes sweeping the bakery in a slow, methodical pass. The display case gleamed under the dim lights. The counters were wiped clean. The chairs were stacked in a neat line like they were waiting for a lecture.

Wes leaned his shoulder into the wall and tried to look casual about having a cop in his bakery at… he glanced at the clock… 10:47 p.m.

“Are you going to… do cop things?” Wes asked.

Sam’s gaze flicked to him. “I’m doing them.”

Wes tilted his head. “Standing very still?”

Sam’s mouth twitched again, almost a smile. “Listening.”

Wes frowned. “For what?”

Sam held up one finger.

Wes shut his mouth.

For a few seconds, the bakery was quiet except for the soft ticking of the ovens cooling down. Wes had always liked that sound. It was a promise that the day was over, the work done, the world temporarily held at bay.

Then something scratched.

Wes’s blood went cold in a way that had nothing to do with winter.

The scratch came again, followed by a tiny thump.

Sam’s gaze moved, sharp and calm, toward the back hallway that led to the pantry and the utility closet.

Wes lifted his hands. “Okay. So. I would like to clarify that I did not invite anyone into my bakery. I barely invite people into my life.”

Sam’s eyes stayed on the hallway. “Stay here.”

Wes made a face. “I live here, emotionally. Of course I’m staying here.”

Sam’s head turned just enough for Wes to see the warning in his expression. Not anger. Not impatience. Just a firm line that suggested Sam was used to people doing dumb things and had run out of tolerance for it.

Wes held up a hand. “Fine. I’m a statue. A handsome, cinnamon-scented statue.”

Sam moved.

He didn’t rush. He didn’t stalk dramatically like he was in a crime show. He walked with quiet certainty, steps controlled, weight balanced like he’d learned to move through other people’s panic without adding to it.

Wes watched him go with a weird twist in his chest that he absolutely refused to label.

Sam reached the hallway, paused, then glanced back at Wes.

Wes froze in place and tried to look like a statue that wasn’t terrified of raccoons.

Sam’s gaze lingered for a second too long, and Wes’s pulse stuttered.

Then Sam turned and disappeared into the dark.

Wes swallowed and tried to breathe through his nose like a reasonable person. He failed. Everything smelled like sugar and spice and the cold clean edge of Sam’s coat.

A clatter sounded from the back.

Wes winced. “Please don’t shoot anything,” he called. “If it’s a raccoon, I can negotiate. I speak fluent trash panda.”

“Wes,” Sam called back, voice low.

Wes’s spine went rigid.

Sam had said his name like he already knew it belonged in his mouth.

Wes cleared his throat. “Yes?”

“Do you have cats?”

Wes blinked. “No.”

There was a brief pause.

Then Sam’s voice, still calm, said, “You do now.”

Wes shoved off the wall and started toward the hallway before he remembered he’d been told to stay.

Sam appeared at the end of the hall with something squirming in his hands.

It was small. Grey. Furious. Very much not a cat.

Wes stared. “That is not a cat.”

Sam’s expression was unchanged, but his eyes looked… amused. “Correct.”

The creature made an offended noise that sounded like it had swallowed a kazoo. It wriggled harder, tiny paws flailing.

Wes squinted. “Is that a possum?”

“It’s a baby raccoon,” Sam said.

Wes put a hand to his chest. “Oh, thank God. For a second I thought it was a demon.”

Sam walked toward the front counter, holding the raccoon with hands that were somehow both gentle and unyielding. The raccoon snapped its little teeth in the air like it wanted to sue for defamation.

Wes watched Sam’s fingers, steady and careful, and felt a ridiculous thought float through his brain.

*Those hands could do a lot of things.*

Wes immediately tried to drown that thought in cinnamon. It didn’t work.

“How did it get in here?” Wes asked, forcing his voice back into normal territory.

Sam nodded toward the back. “Window in the utility closet was unlatched.”

Wes frowned. “That window is always latched.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to him. “Always?”

Wes hesitated.

If Wes had a flaw, besides being emotionally constipated and willing to fight a man over the last cinnamon knot, it was that he assumed he could handle everything alone.

Wes sighed. “Okay. Fine. Sometimes I crack it for ventilation after I mop. Because the cleaner smells like chemical despair.”

Sam’s brow lifted a fraction. “And you forgot to latch it.”

Wes pointed at the raccoon. “I would like to file a complaint against this tiny criminal. He broke in. He trespassed. He is not wearing a hairnet.”

The raccoon made another furious kazoo noise.

Sam looked down at it. “He’s a baby.”

Wes stared. “That’s how they get you. It’s a con.”

Sam’s mouth tipped again. A real hint of a smile this time, brief and dangerous. “Where do you want him?”

Wes blinked at the question, then at Sam’s hands.

Wes was not thinking about raccoons anymore.

Wes snapped his gaze back up like he’d been caught stealing. “Outside. Preferably far away. With a tiny attorney present.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay.”

He carried the baby raccoon out the front door like it was a delicate package rather than a tiny felon. Wes followed, pulling the door shut behind them, and the cold hit him full in the face.

Snow dusted the sidewalks and made the streetlamps glow soft and golden. The town was quiet in that late-night way that made everything feel like a secret.

Sam walked to the edge of the alley beside the bakery and crouched near the fence, holding the raccoon low. The little creature wriggled, sniffed, then darted into the shadows with a final indignant squeak.

Wes stared into the alley. “Do you think it will tell its friends?”

Sam straightened. “Probably.”

Wes sighed. “Great. I’m going to get robbed by a raccoon gang.”

Sam’s eyes met his. “Latch the window.”

Wes lifted his hands. “Yes, Dad.”

Sam didn’t look offended by the word. If anything, he looked like he was trying not to laugh.

Wes’s chest did that weird tightening thing again. Sam laughing would be… a problem. A warm, dangerous problem.

Wes shoved his hands in his pockets and tried to shift the conversation into safer territory. “So who called you? Like, who’s out here panic-reporting my bakery at midnight?”

Sam’s gaze slid to the street as if checking for witnesses, then returned. “Mayor Kringle.”

Wes froze. “The mayor called in a break-in?”

Sam’s expression was neutral. “He said he saw a light on.”

Wes’s eyes narrowed. “The man lives for drama.”

Sam’s gaze sharpened with something like agreement. “He also said you’ve been working too much.”

Wes bristled. “I work a normal amount.”

Sam looked at him.

Wes sighed. “I work an emotionally unhealthy amount.”

Sam’s eyes held his for a beat too long. “Yes.”

Wes should’ve been annoyed. He should’ve cracked a joke and bounced right past the uncomfortable honesty.

Instead, he felt his shoulders drop, just a little, like his body trusted Sam’s steadiness more than Wes trusted himself.

Wes cleared his throat. “You can go now. The bakery is safe from the raccoon menace.”

Sam didn’t move.

The snow fell in slow quiet flakes around them, and Wes suddenly became acutely aware of how alone he was out here, standing under a streetlamp in front of his bakery, with a man who smelled like winter and looked at him like Wes mattered.

Sam’s voice was low. “Do you live above the shop?”

Wes blinked. “Yeah.”

Sam nodded once. “I’m going to walk you up.”

Wes’s pulse stumbled. “That’s… not necessary.”

Sam’s gaze didn’t waver. “It is.”

Wes opened his mouth to argue.

Then he remembered what he’d written on the employee board last week in a moment of sleep-deprived honesty:

**REMINDER: LET PEOPLE HELP YOU.**

Wes had circled it twice and underlined it three times, like he could bully himself into receiving care through sheer punctuation.

Wes exhaled. “Fine,” he muttered. “But I’m telling you right now, if you see flour in my hair and judge me, I will cry.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Noted.”

Wes unlocked the front door and held it open for Sam. Sam stepped inside and paused, scanning the bakery again like it was his job to protect it now.

Protect Wes.

Wes felt the thought land and settle, uncomfortable and warm.

He locked the door behind them and turned toward the stairs that led up to his apartment.

Sam followed.

Halfway up, Wes glanced back and found Sam watching him. Not in the casual way people watched to be polite. In the steady, attentive way that made Wes feel… visible.

Wes’s throat tightened. “What?”

Sam’s gaze didn’t move. “You’re shaking again.”

Wes swallowed. “I’m not.”

Sam stopped on the step below him, close enough that Wes could feel his body heat in the cold stairwell. “Wes.”

Wes froze.

Sam’s voice wasn’t sharp. It wasn’t scolding.

It was the same tone Sam had used when he said *stay here*.

Like Sam expected Wes to listen.

Wes stared at him, breath catching for no reason that made sense.

Sam’s eyes softened, barely. “Are you okay?”

Wes hated that the question did something to him.

Wes hated that he wanted to say no.

Wes forced air into his lungs and tried honesty on, just to see if it fit.

“I’m…” Wes swallowed. “Tired.”

Sam nodded once, like Wes had just confirmed a fact Sam already knew. “Yeah.”

Wes tried for a joke. “Good news is, I’m too tired to commit any crimes.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You already did.”

Wes blinked. “Excuse me?”

Sam’s gaze flicked over Wes’s face, then held. “You worked all day. You cleaned. You stayed late. You forgot to latch the window. You invited a raccoon into your life.”

Wes huffed a laugh despite himself. “That’s not a crime.”

Sam’s voice dropped, quieter now. “It is if you do it alone.”

Wes went still.

There it was again. That straight-line honesty that made Wes feel like he’d been seen through, gently but completely.

Wes licked his lips, suddenly aware of the small space between them. The quiet. The fact that Sam hadn’t moved away.

Wes’s voice came out rough. “You always talk like this?”

Sam’s gaze stayed on him. “Only when I mean it.”

Wes’s pulse thudded once, hard.

Then he did the only sensible thing he could do in the face of sincerity.

He kept walking.

He unlocked his apartment door at the top of the stairs, stepped inside, and flicked on the light.

His place was small. Warm. Smelled like sugar and laundry detergent. A holiday throw blanket had been tossed over the couch like it had given up.

Wes turned and found Sam in the doorway, framed by the stairwell light, coat still on, eyes sweeping the room like it was another scene he needed to assess.

Sam’s gaze landed on the couch. The blanket. The single mug in the sink. The stack of festival flyers on the counter.

His eyes returned to Wes.

“You’re doing the Twelve Days baking,” Sam said, like it wasn’t a question.

Wes’s shoulders tensed. “Yeah.”

Sam nodded once. “Mayor Kringle should’ve assigned someone to check on you.”

Wes snorted. “He assigned you.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Yeah.”

Wes stared back, heart doing something stupid. “So what now, Officer Rook? You going to arrest me for overworking?”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes waited.

Sam’s voice went even lower. “I’m going to make sure you eat something.”

Wes blinked. “I eat.”

Sam looked at him.

Wes threw up his hands. “Fine. I eat pastry scraps and resentment.”

Sam stepped fully into the apartment, the door clicking shut behind him, and Wes suddenly couldn’t tell if the warmth in the room was from the heater or from the fact that Sam Rook was here, in his space, like he belonged.

Sam’s gaze dropped to Wes’s hands. Flour dusted under his nails. Small burn marks near his knuckles where the tray had slipped earlier.

Sam’s eyes lifted again, steady.

“Sit,” Sam said.

Wes stared.

His pulse jumped like a traitor.

Wes swallowed, then leaned back against his kitchen counter and tried to sound like he wasn’t suddenly in danger of feelings.

“You Christmas people,” Wes muttered. “Always with the orders.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Sit, Wes.”

Wes’s breath caught.

He sat.

And for the first time in weeks, the quiet didn’t feel lonely.

It felt like someone had shown up.

**[STOP WRITING]**


Wes sat on the edge of his couch like he was waiting for a verdict.

Sam stood in the middle of the room, coat still on, hands still bare, gaze steady as if Wes had just turned into another scene Sam needed to secure. Except this wasn’t a bakery. There were no raccoons to remove. No doors to lock.

Just Wes, caught in the beam of Sam’s attention like it was a spotlight he hadn’t agreed to step into.

Sam glanced toward the kitchenette. “Do you have food?”

Wes bristled automatically. “I have ingredients.”

Sam’s eyes returned to him. “That’s not what I asked.”

Wes’s mouth tightened. “Yes.”

Sam didn’t say *prove it.* He didn’t have to. He just walked to the fridge and opened it like he’d been invited.

Wes watched in frozen disbelief.

The fridge light revealed… exactly what Wes had expected. Half a carton of eggs. A block of cheese. Leftover soup in a container with a handwritten label that said **DO NOT EAT** which, in fairness, was mostly a note to Wes himself from three days ago. A tub of butter. Milk that was flirting with its expiration date.

Sam took it in, then closed the fridge with a quiet click.

Wes cleared his throat. “I’m not helpless.”

Sam’s gaze flicked over him. Flour on his knuckles. A faint red line across one finger. The tired slump he’d been pretending wasn’t there.

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “I didn’t say you were.”

Wes stared.

Sam’s eyes didn’t waver. “I said you’re not eating.”

Wes opened his mouth, then shut it again. Because… yeah. Okay. Fair.

Sam turned slightly and looked at the counter. There was a loaf of bread in a paper bag. A jar of jam. A butter knife sitting in the sink like it had given up halfway through a life.

Sam pointed at the bread. “That’s bread.”

Wes blinked. “Incredible detective work.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, almost. “Sit still.”

Wes’s pulse jumped again. He hated that his body reacted like it recognized the tone.

He shifted on the couch, trying to find a posture that didn’t scream *I am emotionally compromised by a man holding the concept of authority.* “If you’re about to make me a sandwich, I need you to know this is going to ruin my reputation.”

Sam didn’t look at him as he pulled out the bread. “Your reputation is already ruined.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “By whom?”

Sam glanced back. “By you.”

Wes’s throat tightened in the most irritating way. He tried to laugh it off. “I’m an upstanding citizen. I only commit crimes against butter.”

Sam set two slices of bread on a plate with quiet competence. “You work alone.”

Wes’s stomach dipped. He forced breeziness. “I run a bakery. Alone is kind of the job description.”

Sam’s gaze slid to him. “No. Alone is the way you do it.”

Wes went still.

Sam turned back to the counter. He opened a drawer, found a knife without asking, and began slicing the cheese. The domestic ease of the motion felt… illegal. Like Sam shouldn’t belong in Wes’s apartment this naturally.

Wes stared at his own hands in his lap. The flour that never fully washed out. The small burns he’d ignored. The way his fingers curled like they were always bracing to grip something.

“You’re not my dad,” Wes muttered.

Sam’s voice came back without pause. “I know.”

Wes swallowed. “Then stop acting like I’m twelve.”

Sam set the cheese down. His gaze lifted, steady and quiet.

“I’m not treating you like you’re twelve,” Sam said. “I’m treating you like you matter.”

Wes’s breath caught.

He hated that. He hated how simple it was. How it slipped past all his defenses because it wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t a grand statement. It was just… true.

Wes forced air out of his lungs. “People treat me like I matter all the time.”

Sam raised his brows. “Do they?”

Wes flinched.

Sam didn’t pounce on it. He turned back to the counter and spread butter on the bread with slow, even strokes.

The quiet filled the room again, but it wasn’t lonely now. It was full. It had weight.

Wes’s voice came out smaller than he meant it to. “Mayor Kringle told you to check on me.”

Sam set the knife down. “He asked me to.”

Wes’s eyes narrowed. “That’s not an answer.”

Sam looked at Wes for a long beat. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, thumb tapping once. He held it up so Wes could see the screen.

A text thread.

**MAYOR KRINGLE:** *Light on at Candle & Crumb again. He’s going to work himself into the ground.*
**MAYOR KRINGLE:** *Can you swing by?*
**MAYOR KRINGLE:** *As a friend.*
**SAM:** *On my way.*

Wes stared at the last line until it burned.

“As a friend,” Wes repeated, voice flat.

Sam’s gaze didn’t waver. “Yes.”

Wes tried to scoff, but it came out weak. “Since when are we friends?”

Sam set the phone away and picked up the plate. He walked over, stopped in front of Wes, and held it out.

On the plate: a grilled cheese that looked like it belonged in a brochure. Golden, crisp edges. Melted cheese pulling slightly at the seam.

Wes stared like he’d been handed a live grenade.

Sam’s voice was calm. “Eat.”

Wes looked up. “Is everyone in this town obsessed with telling people to sit and eat?”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “The people who care are.”

Wes took the plate because not taking it felt impossible. His fingers brushed Sam’s for half a second.

Sam didn’t pull away. He didn’t press closer. He just let the touch exist, like it mattered and like it wasn’t going to be used against Wes later.

Wes sat there holding a sandwich and trying not to feel like he’d been given something dangerous.

Sam took a seat in the chair across from the couch, posture easy but alert, like he was still working. Like Wes was still a scene worth protecting.

Wes picked up the sandwich and took a bite.

It was… really good.

Wes chewed slowly, glare fixed on Sam. “You did not have to make it this good.”

Sam’s eyes warmed faintly. “I did.”

Wes swallowed. “You’re annoying.”

Sam nodded. “I’ve heard.”

Wes took another bite. The warmth of the food hit his stomach like a quiet apology.

For a minute, they didn’t speak. Wes ate. Sam watched him with a steadiness that should’ve been invasive but somehow wasn’t. Like Sam was counting Wes’s bites the way Noel counted volunteer shifts. Like feeding Wes was simply another problem solved.

Wes finished half the sandwich before the words slipped out, uninvited.

“I hate it when people see me like this.”

Sam’s gaze sharpened, but his voice stayed soft. “Like what?”

Wes gestured vaguely at himself. At the flour. The tiredness. The fact that he was sitting down.

“Not in control,” Wes admitted. “Not… sparkling.”

Sam was quiet for a beat.

Then he said, “You don’t have to sparkle to be worth looking at.”

Wes’s throat tightened again. It was becoming a trend.

Wes swallowed hard and looked away toward the window, the soft fall of snow, the glow of a streetlamp.

“You’re too calm,” Wes said, because it was easier than saying *thank you.*

Sam’s voice came low. “You’re too alone.”

Wes’s hands clenched around the sandwich.

He tried to laugh. Tried to turn it into a joke. “Maybe I like it.”

Sam didn’t argue.

He just said, very evenly, “No.”

Wes’s head snapped up. “Excuse me?”

Sam’s gaze held his. Patient. Certain. “You like control,” Sam corrected. “You like knowing what happens next. You like being needed.”

Wes went still, like Sam had just read his diary.

Sam’s voice lowered, gentler without losing firmness. “You don’t like being lonely.”

Wes’s mouth opened.

No words came out.

Because Sam was right, and Wes hated him for it.

Wes looked down at the sandwich in his hands, now smaller, half gone. He realized he’d eaten without thinking, like his body had trusted Sam’s order more than Wes’s own denial.

Wes licked his lips, voice rough. “So what. You’re going to start showing up and… parenting me?”

Sam’s eyes softened, barely. “No.”

Wes’s pulse stumbled. “Then what?”

Sam leaned forward slightly, forearms on his knees. Not crowding. Not pushing. Just… there.

“I’m going to check on you,” Sam said. “During the Twelve Days.”

Wes stared. “Why?”

Sam’s gaze didn’t move. “Because the festival makes people stupid.”

Wes blinked. “That’s your official stance?”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “It’s my professional assessment.”

Wes tried to snort. It came out like a breath. “And that’s the only reason.”

Sam’s eyes warmed like he’d been expecting the challenge. “No.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “So what’s the other reason, Officer?”

Sam’s voice went lower, quiet enough that it felt like a secret in Wes’s apartment.

“Because I like you.”

Wes froze.

The words were simple. Clean. No theatrics. No flirtation to hide behind.

Just truth.

Wes’s heart hammered once, hard, like it wanted to escape.

He forced a laugh that sounded wrong in his own ears. “You barely know me.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “I know you stay late. I know you feed the whole town. I know you make yourself small when you’re tired so nobody notices.” Sam paused. “I know you let me in.”

Wes’s breath caught.

He looked down at the sandwich again like it might give him instructions.

It didn’t.

Wes scraped together the only defense he had left. “You’re going to ruin my ability to pretend I’m fine.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “Good.”

Wes stared at him. “That’s not a nice thing to say.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “It’s a necessary thing to say.”

Wes’s fingers tightened around the plate. He hated the heat creeping up his neck. Hated the way his body leaned toward Sam’s steadiness like it wanted to rest against it.

Wes swallowed. “Okay,” he said, too fast, because slowing down felt like falling. “Okay, you can check on me. But you don’t get to… make it weird.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, almost a smile. “Define weird.”

Wes glared. “No.”

Sam’s gaze warmed, amused now. “That’s not a definition.”

Wes groaned and pushed a hand through his hair, then immediately regretted it because flour probably exploded everywhere. “You know what I mean.”

Sam stood up.

Wes’s pulse jumped again because apparently Wes’s body had decided Sam moving was now a full event.

Sam walked to the counter, picked up a paper towel, and dampened it at the sink. Then he came back and stopped in front of Wes.

Wes stared up at him, suspicious. “What are you doing.”

Sam held up the paper towel. “You have flour on your cheek.”

Wes’s face went hot. “I do not.”

Sam didn’t argue.

He lifted the towel and touched Wes’s cheek with a gentleness that made Wes’s whole body go still.

Sam wiped once, slow.

Wes’s breath hitched.

Sam’s gaze flicked to Wes’s eyes. “There.”

Wes swallowed. “Thanks.”

Sam didn’t move away right away. He stayed there, close enough that Wes could feel his presence like a wall at his back.

Wes’s voice came out quiet. “Is this… weird?”

Sam’s mouth tipped, but his eyes were steady. “Not yet.”

Wes’s pulse thudded. “That’s ominous.”

Sam’s voice dropped, softer. “It’s honest.”

Wes stared up at him, caught.

Sam’s gaze dipped to Wes’s mouth for the briefest second.

Wes felt it like a touch.

Sam looked back up, like he’d decided something and then decided not to say it.

“I’m going to go,” Sam said.

Wes’s chest tightened, immediate and sharp. He hated that too.

Wes forced a shrug. “Sure. You did your civic duty. Saved me from raccoons and starvation.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’ll check the utility window on my way out.”

Wes nodded. “You do that.”

Sam turned toward the door, then paused, hand on the knob.

He didn’t look back right away.

When he did, his gaze met Wes’s like a tether.

“Lock the door behind me,” Sam said.

Wes blinked. “I can lock a door.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I know.”

Wes frowned. “Then why are you telling me.”

Sam’s voice came low, steady. “Because I’m going to be here tomorrow morning.”

Wes froze. “What?”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’m walking the route for the Twelve Days tree delivery anyway. Noel and Eben are meeting at Merryweather Hall at seven. I’ll swing by the bakery at six-thirty.”

Wes stared, heart thudding. “Why do you know Noel’s schedule.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Because the whole town knows Noel’s schedule.”

Wes made a face. “Fair.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Eat breakfast,” Sam said.

Wes pointed with the plate. “I just ate.”

Sam’s brows lifted. “Tomorrow.”

Wes groaned. “You’re all insane.”

Sam’s eyes warmed, amused. “Yes.”

Then Sam opened the door, let in a bite of cold air, and stepped into the stairwell.

Wes sat there holding an empty plate and realizing, with slow horror, that he was smiling.

And that the quiet didn’t feel lonely anymore.

It felt like anticipation.

**[STOP WRITING]**



Wes woke up to the smell of cinnamon and the faint, traitorous feeling of hope.

Which was stupid, because hope was how you ended up volunteering to bake six hundred cookies for a toy drive and then spending the night cleaning raccoon paw prints off your pantry shelves.

He rolled over, squinting at the clock.

**6:04 a.m.**

Wes made a sound that was half groan, half threat. “No.”

His apartment was still dim, the winter light barely creeping around the edges of the curtains. The bakery below him was quiet, which meant he was currently experiencing the rare and endangered state known as *not actively working.*

Wes stared at the ceiling for three long breaths.

Then, because he was apparently the kind of person who had *opinions* about being told what to do, he sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed.

“Breakfast,” he muttered, to nobody. “Fine. Congratulations. You win.”

He shuffled into the kitchen, hair doing something unholy, and opened the fridge again as if the contents might have magically improved overnight.

They had not.

Wes stared at the eggs like they’d betrayed him.

A knock sounded from the stairwell door below.

Wes froze.

His heartbeat did that little lurch again, the one he’d been pretending wasn’t connected to Sam Rook.

The knock came again, steady and polite.

Wes stared at the clock.

**6:31 a.m.**

Wes’s throat tightened.

He was on time.

Wes hated that he noticed.

Wes hated that the noticing felt like a small gift.

Wes grabbed the first hoodie he saw, yanked it over his head, and stomped down the stairs barefoot like a man determined to look unimpressed by the concept of being cared about.

He unlocked the bakery door and yanked it open.

Sam stood on the doorstep with a paper bag in one hand and two coffees in the other, breath fogging in the cold like the morning itself belonged to him.

Wes’s brain stopped functioning for a full second.

Sam’s gaze swept over Wes in the doorway. Bare feet. Hoodie. Sleep-tousled hair. A faint line of flour still on his wrist because apparently Wes shed baking evidence like glitter.

Something softened in Sam’s eyes.

Wes immediately resented it.

“You’re early,” Wes said.

Sam’s mouth tipped, almost. “I’m on time.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “That’s the same thing.”

Sam held up the paper bag. “Breakfast.”

Wes stared at the bag like it might be a trap. “Did you… bring me food.”

Sam’s expression stayed neutral. “Yes.”

Wes’s voice went suspicious. “From where.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Garland Cup.”

Wes blinked. “The Garland Cup is… two blocks away.”

Sam nodded once. “It opens at six.”

Wes’s throat tightened for no reason that made sense. He stepped back automatically to let Sam in, because the alternative was standing here with the door open while Sam looked at him like that.

Sam stepped inside and paused, gaze flicking around the bakery like he couldn’t help himself. Checking corners. Checking locks. Checking that Wes was, in fact, still alive.

Wes shut the door behind him and tried to sound casual. “So you’re just… doing wellness checks now.”

Sam set the coffees on the counter. “Call it a community initiative.”

Wes scoffed. “You’re going to ruin my brand.”

Sam’s gaze slid to him. “Your brand is ‘I’m fine’ while you’re actively collapsing.”

Wes bristled. “I am not collapsing.”

Sam’s eyes held his.

Wes exhaled. “Okay. I’m collapsing aesthetically.”

Sam’s mouth tipped again, a real hint of amusement. “Sit.”

Wes stared at him.

His pulse jumped.

Wes hated his body.

“No,” Wes said on principle.

Sam didn’t argue. He just reached into the paper bag and pulled out a wrapped breakfast sandwich, then set it on a plate like he lived here.

Wes watched Sam’s hands, calm and competent, doing small domestic things in Wes’s space like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Wes’s voice came out quieter. “You really like telling people to sit.”

Sam didn’t look up. “You really like pretending you don’t need to.”

Wes’s throat tightened. Again. It was getting annoying.

Wes moved to the counter and leaned on it, arms crossed. “Fine. I’ll stand and eat. Like a rebellious teenager.”

Sam’s gaze flicked up, steady. “If you stand and eat, you’ll start working.”

Wes froze.

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “You’ll finish the sandwich in three bites. You’ll go check the ovens. You’ll tell yourself you’re just making sure everything’s fine. And then it’ll be noon and you’ll be running on pastry scraps and spite.”

Wes stared at him.

“How do you know that,” Wes demanded.

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Because I’ve been watching you do it for two years.”

Wes’s breath caught.

He tried to hide it by rolling his eyes. “That’s creepy.”

Sam’s expression didn’t change. “It’s concerned.”

Wes swallowed hard and glanced away, pretending to be offended by the display case rather than the fact that Sam had just admitted he’d been paying attention for *two years.*

Wes forced a laugh. “So what, you’ve been in love with my croissants this whole time?”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Among other things.”

Wes’s heart did something stupid and loud.

Wes stared at Sam like he was a new ingredient Wes wasn’t sure was safe to ingest.

“You can’t just say things like that,” Wes muttered.

Sam’s voice stayed low, steady. “Why not.”

Wes threw up his hands. “Because I’m not built for it.”

Sam’s eyes softened, just a fraction. “Then I’ll go slow.”

Wes’s chest tightened so sharply he almost flinched.

Sam stepped closer, stopping just on the other side of the counter. Not crowding. Not demanding. Just… present.

Sam’s gaze flicked to Wes’s bare feet. “You’re cold.”

Wes scoffed. “I’m always cold. It’s a bakery. It’s basically a sugar freezer until the ovens kick on.”

Sam reached out, slow, and didn’t touch Wes. His hand hovered near Wes’s wrist, giving Wes time to pull away.

“May I,” Sam asked.

Wes stared at the hand hovering like it was a live wire.

He should’ve said no. He should’ve made a joke. He should’ve done anything except let this turn into something real.

But Sam had asked like Wes’s yes mattered. Like Wes was allowed to choose.

Wes swallowed. “Yeah,” he said, voice rough. “Okay.”

Sam’s fingers closed gently around Wes’s wrist. Not tight. Not restraining. Just warm, steady contact that made Wes’s breath catch like he’d been punched.

Sam’s thumb brushed once over the inside of Wes’s wrist, right where Wes’s pulse hammered.

Wes’s brain went very quiet.

Sam’s eyes stayed on Wes’s face, watching his reaction like it mattered.

“Good,” Sam murmured.

Wes’s stomach flipped.

Wes forced air into his lungs. “Stop doing that.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Doing what.”

Wes gestured vaguely at his entire body. “That. Whatever that is. The… calm voice. The ‘good.’ The… touching my pulse like you’re checking if I’m alive.”

Sam’s thumb stilled instantly. “Do you want me to stop touching you.”

Wes’s mouth opened.

No words came out.

Because the answer was no and Wes hated that.

Wes exhaled hard. “No,” he admitted, then immediately tried to recover with humor. “But don’t make it weird.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Define weird.”

Wes groaned. “You’re impossible.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Sit,” Sam said again. Softer this time. “Please.”

The please landed like a second hand on Wes’s spine. Not pushing. Just… asking.

Wes hated that his eyes stung.

Wes turned away fast, grabbed the breakfast sandwich like it was an excuse, and sat on the stool behind the counter.

“There,” Wes muttered. “Happy?”

Sam’s eyes softened. “Yes.”

Wes took a bite of the sandwich and realized it was unfairly good. Egg, cheese, a little pepper, the bread toasted just enough to crunch.

Wes glared around the bakery as if someone could be blamed for how safe he suddenly felt.

Sam leaned his hip against the counter, close but not too close, and took a sip of his coffee.

Wes chewed and tried not to stare at Sam’s mouth.

He failed.

Sam’s gaze caught him.

Wes immediately looked down at his sandwich like it had committed a crime.

Sam’s voice was quiet. “I’m walking the tree delivery route.”

Wes swallowed. “Right. The thing you said you were doing.”

Sam nodded. “Noel is meeting Eben at Merryweather Hall.”

Wes snorted around a bite. “That poor man.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Noel or Eben.”

“Both,” Wes said promptly. “Noel needs to sit down and Eben needs to stop looking like he’s about to file everyone as a liability.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Eben’s not wrong.”

Wes swallowed and took another bite, then paused. “So you’re… helping them.”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “I’m helping the festival.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “That’s not an answer.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “I’m helping you.”

Wes’s throat tightened.

Wes stared at his sandwich because if he looked at Sam too long, something was going to crack and then Wes would have to deal with it, and Wes did not have time for emotional revelations before dawn.

Wes swallowed hard. “Why,” he asked again, quieter this time. Realer.

Sam didn’t answer right away.

When he did, his voice was low. “Because you take care of everyone.”

Wes’s fingers tightened around the wrapper.

Sam continued, calm as ever. “You feed the town. You show up for every committee event. You make extra trays when someone’s short. You stay late so other people can go home.” Sam paused. “And you don’t let anyone take care of you.”

Wes’s chest ached.

Wes tried to scoff. It came out weak. “I don’t need taking care of.”

Sam’s gaze didn’t waver. “Yes, you do.”

Wes’s breath hitched.

Sam’s voice softened, just a fraction. “That doesn’t make you weak.”

Wes’s throat tightened. His eyes burned.

Wes hated that the words were working.

Wes swallowed hard and took another bite, because chewing was safer than crying.

Sam watched him, steady.

Wes finished the sandwich more slowly this time. On purpose. Like he was proving something to himself. Like he could receive without immediately turning it into fuel for more work.

When he was done, Wes set the wrapper down and exhaled.

“Congratulations,” Wes muttered. “I have eaten. You can put a gold star on my forehead.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I might.”

Wes’s pulse stumbled. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed, amused. “Okay.”

Wes stared at him. “You say okay like you mean it.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “I do.”

Wes’s breath caught again.

He leaned his elbows on the counter and rubbed his face with both hands like he could physically wipe away his feelings.

When he lowered his hands, Sam was still watching him.

Wes’s voice came out quiet. “Are you going to do this every morning.”

Sam’s brows lifted slightly. “Do what.”

Wes gestured vaguely between them. “Show up. Feed me. Make me sit down. Ruin my ability to pretend I’m fine.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “If you want me to.”

Wes went still.

There it was again. The choice. The permission. The fact that Sam wasn’t forcing his way into Wes’s life. He was just… offering a hand and letting Wes decide whether to take it.

Wes stared at Sam for a long beat.

Then, because Wes Candle was apparently determined to terrify himself, he said, “Okay.”

Sam’s expression didn’t change much, but something in his eyes warmed like a light turning on.

“Okay,” Sam echoed.

Wes swallowed. “But we set rules.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Rules.”

Wes nodded, finding structure like it was a life raft. “Yes. You don’t get to tell anyone about the raccoon.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Agreed.”

“And you don’t get to rearrange my kitchen like you live there.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I didn’t rearrange anything.”

Wes pointed. “You found a knife without asking. That’s basically moving in.”

Sam’s eyes stayed amused. “Noted.”

“And,” Wes added, voice going quieter, more serious despite himself, “you don’t get to… make fun of me if I’m not okay sometimes.”

Sam’s amusement faded into something steady and real. “I wouldn’t.”

Wes’s throat tightened again. “Promise.”

Sam’s gaze held his like it was a vow. “I promise.”

Wes exhaled, shaky, and looked away before he did something stupid like believe it too hard.

A sound came from downstairs. A faint click, like something shifting in the bakery.

Wes’s head snapped up.

Sam’s posture changed instantly, alert. “What was that.”

Wes frowned. “Probably the ovens settling.”

The click came again.

Wes’s stomach dropped. “Or.”

Sam moved without a word, stepping around the counter with quiet speed. His hand went to his belt out of habit, then stopped. No gun. Just a cop’s muscle memory.

Wes stared. “If that’s another raccoon, I’m moving.”

Sam shot him a look. “Stay here.”

Wes opened his mouth to argue.

Sam’s gaze cut to him, calm but firm, and Wes’s body did the same thing it had done last night.

It listened.

Wes froze, heart pounding.

Sam stepped toward the back hallway, silent as winter.

Wes clutched the coffee cup in both hands like it could be weaponized.

The click came again.

Then a familiar, irritated voice called from the pantry area, “Wes! Why is there a broom booby-trapped against the door like you’re defending a castle?”

Wes’s eyes widened.

“Oh no,” Wes whispered.

Sam paused mid-step, brows lifting.

Wes’s shoulders slumped with immediate dread. “That,” Wes said softly, “is Hugh Everhart.”

Sam’s gaze flicked back to Wes. “You have a man trapped in your pantry.”

Wes closed his eyes. “It’s worse. I have Hugh trapped in my pantry.”

Hugh’s voice rose, offended. “I heard that!”

Wes muttered, “Of course you did.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, almost. “Do you want me to arrest him.”

Wes opened his eyes and stared at Sam.

For one beautiful second, Wes imagined it.

Then Wes sighed. “No. But if he has glitter, you’re allowed to use force.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Noted.”

Wes watched Sam head down the hall, then, because his life was apparently a holiday sitcom now, Wes called, “Hugh! If you break anything, you’re replacing it with something that isn’t covered in rhinestones!”

Hugh’s voice came back immediately. “I would never! Also, why is Sam Rook in your bakery at dawn?”

Wes froze.

Sam froze.

The air went dangerously still.

Wes stared at the hallway, then down at his bare feet, then at the empty sandwich wrapper, like any of those things would help.

Sam’s voice, calm but edged with amusement, drifted back. “Good morning, Hugh.”

Hugh made a delighted sound. “Oh my God. It’s true.”

Wes put his head on the counter. “I hate this town.”

Sam’s voice came softer, closer now. “No, you don’t.”

Wes’s cheeks heated. He didn’t lift his head. “Shut up.”

Sam’s low chuckle warmed the air like cocoa.

Wes stayed very still, heart pounding, realizing two terrible things at once:

One: Sam Rook sounded *good* when he laughed.

Two: Wes Candle was going to let him keep doing it.

**[STOP WRITING]**



Wes kept his forehead on the counter like it could absorb humiliation through osmosis.

Behind him, footsteps approached with the calm inevitability of consequences.

Sam’s presence stopped just beside Wes, close enough that Wes could feel the warmth of him in the chilly bakery air. Sam didn’t touch him. He didn’t tease. He just stood there like a guardrail.

Wes muttered into the laminate, “If Hugh is holding glitter, I’m setting the building on fire and collecting the insurance.”

Sam’s voice was low. “Arson is not festive.”

Wes lifted his head an inch. “It is if it’s symbolic.”

Before Sam could respond, Hugh Everhart emerged from the hallway like a man making an entrance on a stage he fully believed belonged to him.

Hugh was bundled in a bright scarf that looked handmade and aggressively cheerful. His hair was a bit wild, his cheeks pink from the cold, and he was carrying… a box.

Wes stared. “Why are you here.”

Hugh blinked innocently. “Good morning to you too, sunshine.”

Wes pointed at the clock. “It is not morning. It is criminal o’clock.”

Hugh set the box on the counter with a reverent little thump. “I came to save you.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “From what.”

Hugh looked genuinely baffled. “From yourself.”

Sam made a small sound that might’ve been a cough. It also might’ve been a laugh he swallowed.

Wes’s cheeks went hot again. “Why were you in my pantry.”

Hugh waved a hand. “The window in the utility closet was open. I saw the light on. I assumed you’d died.”

Wes stared. “That is… not a normal assumption.”

Hugh shrugged. “This is Tinsel Town. Dramatic interpretations are a civic duty.”

Sam’s gaze slid to Wes. “You left the window unlatched.”

Wes glared at him. “Don’t start.”

Hugh’s eyes darted between them, interest sharpening like a cat spotting a laser pointer. “Okay,” Hugh said slowly. “So Sam is here because of the window. And you are wearing a hoodie with no shoes. And you are blushing.”

Wes lunged across the counter and slapped a hand down on the box. “What is this.”

Hugh smiled like he’d been waiting for the moment. “A care package.”

Wes stared. “A what.”

Hugh lifted the lid.

Inside were: a thermos, two neatly wrapped muffins, a jar of something that looked like homemade jam, and a small tin labeled in Hugh’s glittery handwriting:

**SLEEP TEA. DRINK IT OR I’LL CRY.**

Wes blinked.

Sam’s gaze flicked to the tin, then to Wes, something unreadable softening in his eyes.

Hugh leaned in. “I am conducting unofficial wellness checks on Noel’s entire committee because if you people collapse, the festival collapses, and if the festival collapses, I will have to emotionally process disappointment, which I refuse to do.”

Wes swallowed. “That’s… almost kind.”

Hugh beamed. “Thank you.”

Wes rubbed his face. “Why muffins.”

Hugh looked offended. “Because you cannot survive on cookie scraps and resentment.”

Sam’s mouth tipped.

Wes shot him a look. “Stop finding this funny.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’m not.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “You are.”

Sam didn’t deny it. Which was honestly worse.

Hugh’s gaze flicked again between them, bright with curiosity. “So,” Hugh said, too casually, “are we talking about you two, or are we still pretending Sam just wanders into bakeries at dawn for civic enrichment.”

Wes pointed toward the door. “Out.”

Hugh clutched his chest. “Excuse you.”

“Out,” Wes repeated. “Before I weaponize frosting.”

Sam stepped in smoothly, voice calm. “Hugh.”

Hugh turned to Sam like he’d been summoned by name. “Yes, Officer.”

Sam’s expression was neutral. “Go help Noel.”

Hugh blinked. “Why.”

Sam didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t threaten. He just looked at Hugh with the calm authority of a man who could end a parade with a single sentence.

Hugh sighed dramatically. “Fine. I will go rescue Noel from his martyr complex.”

Wes blinked. “He’s meeting Eben at seven.”

Hugh pointed, delighted. “SEE? You know Noel’s schedule too!”

Wes hissed, “I do not.”

Hugh bounced on his toes. “You do. You’re caring.”

Wes’s cheeks burned. “I’m… adjacent to caring.”

Hugh waved his scarf like it was a flag. “Anyway! I will leave you to your… *breakfast situation.*”

Wes’s glare sharpened. “Hugh.”

Hugh paused at the door, hand on the knob, eyes sparkling with mischief. “Yes?”

Wes pointed at the tin. “No glitter.”

Hugh gasped. “I would never glitter your tea.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Hugh.”

Hugh held up two fingers. “Scout’s honor.”

Hugh slipped out into the cold with a last little grin at Sam, then disappeared down the stairs like a rumor escaping.

The bakery fell quiet again.

Wes stared at the closed door, then exhaled. “That man is going to get me killed.”

Sam’s voice was low, amused. “Probably.”

Wes turned back to the counter and stared at the care package like it was evidence in a case titled *Why Are People Being Nice To Me, This Is Suspicious.*

Sam picked up his coffee and took a sip, gaze still on Wes.

Wes shifted, uncomfortable under the attention. “You didn’t have to bring me breakfast,” he muttered.

Sam’s eyes held his. “I wanted to.”

Wes’s throat tightened again. He hated how easy Sam made that sound. Like wanting to take care of Wes wasn’t something Sam had to justify.

Wes cleared his throat, reaching for the thermos in Hugh’s box like it was safer than looking at Sam. “So. Tree route.”

Sam nodded once. “I’m going to walk past Evergreen Square, then up to Merryweather Hall. Check the streets, check the curb clearance, see where the truck can turn.”

Wes made a face. “You really do plan for everything.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “It’s my job.”

Wes hesitated. “And you… you’re going to keep checking on me.”

Sam didn’t flinch. “If you want me to.”

Wes stared at him for a long beat.

He hated that the answer came so fast.

“Yeah,” Wes said quietly. “I want you to.”

Sam’s eyes warmed in a way that made Wes’s ribs feel too small for his heart.

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Okay.”

Wes swallowed. “But we need more rules.”

Sam’s brows lifted. “More.”

“Yes,” Wes insisted, because structure was how you survived feelings. “Rule one: you don’t get to tell anyone you found me barefoot and pathetic.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You’re not pathetic.”

Wes pointed. “Rule one.”

Sam nodded. “Okay. I won’t tell anyone.”

Wes nodded sharply, like he’d secured a major victory. “Rule two: you don’t get to stare at me like that.”

Sam’s gaze sharpened with quiet amusement. “Like what.”

Wes gestured at his own face. “Like I’m… like I’m the most important thing in the room.”

Sam didn’t answer right away.

Then, very evenly, he said, “You are.”

Wes froze.

The room went still in a way that wasn’t awkward. It was heavy. It was warm. It was dangerous.

Wes’s voice came out rough. “You can’t just say that.”

Sam’s gaze didn’t move. “Why not.”

Wes swallowed hard. “Because then I might believe you.”

Sam’s expression softened, just barely. “Good.”

Wes stared at him, heart pounding, and for a second he couldn’t find a joke. Couldn’t find a deflection. Couldn’t find anything except the truth sitting in his chest like a fresh loaf rising.

Wes’s fingers curled against the counter edge. “Sam.”

Sam’s eyes held his. “Yeah.”

Wes didn’t know what he was going to say.

He just knew he wanted to say *something*.

Sam stepped closer, slow, deliberate, giving Wes time to back away. Time to make it a joke. Time to pull the usual stunt of turning tenderness into sarcasm.

Wes didn’t move.

Sam stopped within arm’s reach. Close enough that Wes could smell coffee and winter. Close enough that Wes’s body leaned forward on its own, traitor that it was.

Sam’s voice went lower. “Do you want me to go.”

Wes blinked. “What.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Do you want space.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He forced honesty because Sam seemed to deserve it.

“No,” Wes whispered.

Sam’s eyes warmed, but his posture stayed careful. “Okay.”

Wes swallowed. The air between them felt charged, like the bakery lights were suddenly too bright.

Wes’s voice came out small. “Do you… do you kiss people you’re doing wellness checks on.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. A real smile this time, brief and soft. “Not usually.”

Wes’s pulse jumped. “But.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to Wes’s mouth, then back to his eyes. “But I’m not here because of the mayor.”

Wes’s breath caught. “Then why.”

Sam’s voice was steady, like a promise he’d decided to keep. “Because I kept noticing you. And I didn’t want to keep pretending I didn’t.”

Wes stared at him, throat tight, and realized he was standing on the edge of something.

Something he wanted.

Something that scared the hell out of him.

Wes swallowed. “If you kiss me,” Wes said, voice shaking a little despite his best efforts, “I’m going to make it weird.”

Sam’s eyes softened with warmth. “I can handle weird.”

Wes exhaled, a shaky laugh. “You say that now.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Wes.”

Wes went still at his name.

Sam didn’t touch him. He didn’t rush him. He just waited, giving Wes the last choice.

Wes stared at him for one long beat.

Then he whispered, “Okay.”

Sam’s expression didn’t change much, but something in his eyes warmed like a light turning on.

Sam leaned in slowly.

Wes met him halfway, because of course he did. Of course Wes Candle, who fed the entire town and pretended he didn’t need anyone, couldn’t resist closing the distance when someone finally asked properly.

Sam’s mouth brushed Wes’s, soft at first. Testing. Asking.

Wes made a small sound that was not dignified and tugged Sam closer by the front of his coat.

Sam’s hand lifted and settled gently at Wes’s jaw, thumb stroking once, grounding him.

The kiss deepened, still slow, still careful, like Sam was building something rather than taking it.

Wes’s knees went weak in the most humiliating way.

Sam pulled back just enough to breathe against Wes’s mouth. “Still okay,” Sam murmured.

Wes swallowed, eyes half-lidded, cheeks hot. “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Good.”

Wes’s body shivered at the praise like it had been waiting for that exact word.

Wes exhaled, forehead tipping forward until it rested briefly against Sam’s. “This is,” Wes whispered, “going to ruin my life.”

Sam’s voice was quiet and steady. “No.”

Wes blinked. “No?”

Sam’s hand stayed at Wes’s jaw, thumb still, anchoring. “It’s going to change it,” Sam said. “That’s not the same thing.”

Wes’s chest tightened. He hated that his eyes stung again.

Wes forced a shaky breath. “Okay,” he whispered, because apparently that was his new thing.

Sam’s gaze softened. “Okay.”

Outside, the morning light brightened, slow and gold.

Somewhere across town, Noel Merrick was probably sprinting toward Merryweather Hall with a clipboard and a prayer. Eben Frost was probably arriving early with a contingency plan and a face that said *humanity is optional.*

And Wes Candle was standing in his bakery, kissed raw and warm, realizing that maybe the Twelve Days weren’t going to just be about sugar and sponsors and schedules.

Maybe they were going to be about letting someone stay.

Sam’s phone buzzed in his pocket.

Sam didn’t move away immediately. He kept his forehead against Wes’s for one more beat, like he was memorizing the moment.

Then he stepped back and checked the screen.

Sam’s expression shifted, subtle but immediate.

Wes’s stomach dipped. “What.”

Sam’s voice went calm, but there was a new edge under it. “Tree truck just called it in.”

Wes blinked. “Called what in.”

Sam looked at him.

“Delivery delay,” Sam said. “Big one.”

Wes stared.

Then, because the universe had timing issues, Wes laughed. “Of course.”

Sam’s gaze stayed on him, steady and practical. “Noel’s going to panic.”

Wes grabbed his apron from the hook like it was armor. “Noel panics professionally.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You’re coming.”

Wes froze. “Excuse me?”

Sam’s gaze held his, and Wes hated that his body reacted to the tone again. “You’re on the committee,” Sam said. “And you’re the only person who can bribe a volunteer mob with baked goods.”

Wes bristled. “That is not true.”

Sam lifted a brow.

Wes sighed. “Fine. It’s true.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Put shoes on.”

Wes grabbed his boots and stomped them on too fast, muttering, “This is why I don’t kiss cops before sunrise. It always leads to labor.”

Sam’s mouth tipped as he pulled his gloves back on. “You kissed me too.”

Wes glared. “Allegedly.”

Sam’s gaze warmed over his shoulder. “Wes.”

Wes’s chest tightened.

“Yeah,” Wes muttered.

Sam’s voice softened, just a fraction. “After we help Noel, you’re eating again.”

Wes stared. “I just ate.”

Sam’s eyes held his. “Later.”

Wes opened his mouth, then closed it.

Because arguing felt pointless.

Because… weirdly… being told to eat sounded like care now, not control.

Wes exhaled. “Fine,” he muttered. “But you’re not allowed to look smug about it.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes grabbed the muffins from Hugh’s box and shoved them into a bag. “Let’s go save Christmas,” Wes said, resigned.

Sam opened the bakery door. Cold air swept in.

Sam paused on the threshold and glanced back at Wes, eyes steady. “You good.”

Wes’s pulse jumped. “That was not a question.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “It was.”

Wes swallowed, then forced honesty like a man walking into weather without a coat.

“I’m… good,” Wes said quietly. “Yeah.”

Sam nodded once, like he’d secured the answer he needed.

Then he stepped into the snow, and Wes followed.

**[STOP WRITING]**





Can I keep writing **this story**? Yes.
Can I keep writing it as **graphic erotica**? No. I’m not here to generate explicit porn on demand, even if the raccoon gang insists it’s “for the art.”

What I *can* do is keep it **steamy, romantic, consent-forward, and very suggestive**, with **fade-to-black** when things would go explicit. Which, frankly, usually sells better in cozy-romcom land anyway.

Picking up exactly where we left off:

---

Snow hit Wes’s face like a judgmental aunt.

He pulled his hood up and followed Sam down the sidewalk, clutching the bag of muffins like it was both a bribe and a weapon. The town was waking slowly, lights still glowing in windows, the streetlamps turning the falling snow into glittering confetti.

Wes squinted at Sam’s broad back, the way his coat moved with each step, the calm speed of him. Sam walked like he belonged in the morning. Like he’d never woken up with flour in his hair and dread in his chest.

Wes trotted to keep up, boots crunching over salted pavement. “So,” Wes said, because silence was how feelings got you, “how bad is the delay.”

Sam didn’t look back. “Bad enough Noel’s going to invent new forms of panic.”

Wes huffed. “Noel’s panic is performance art.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, barely. “Eben won’t tolerate it.”

Wes pictured Eben Frost and his clipboard aura. “Eben doesn’t tolerate oxygen.”

Sam glanced back then, eyes warmed with amusement. “You met him.”

“Twice,” Wes said. “Once with his face. Once with his vibe.”

Sam’s pace didn’t change, but his voice softened the tiniest bit. “Noel needs him.”

Wes’s chest tightened unexpectedly. He glanced at Sam’s profile as they crossed Evergreen Square, the big tree already lit and proud in the center like it was personally offended by the idea of another tree arriving late.

Wes muttered, “Noel needs everyone. Noel collects responsibility like it’s seasonal décor.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to him. “And you don’t.”

Wes rolled his eyes. “I don’t collect responsibility. I curate it.”

Sam’s mouth tipped again. “You also don’t sit down.”

Wes pointed at the snow. “I am literally walking. That’s basically sitting for my soul.”

Sam made a quiet sound that might have been a laugh. It warmed Wes more than it had any right to.

They reached Merryweather Hall and Wes immediately knew things were going sideways.

A cluster of volunteers stood outside the front steps, bundled in scarves, holding clipboards and coffee cups and expressions that said **I was promised a festive morning and instead I got logistical despair**.

Noel stood at the center of them like a very pretty storm cloud in a peacoat.

His cheeks were red from cold, his hair slightly wind-tousled, and he was gesturing with a clipboard like it was a weapon.

Across from him, Eben Frost stood unnervingly calm, hands in his coat pockets, watching Noel like Noel was a system failure he was about to troubleshoot.

Wes slowed. “Oh. There’s the tension.”

Sam’s gaze sharpened. “That’s normal tension.”

Wes nodded gravely. “This town runs on tension.”

Noel spotted them and his face lit up with relief so sharp it looked like a betrayal of his pride.

Wes felt something soften in his chest, because Noel was annoying and loud and emotionally allergic to rest, but Noel was also the kind of person who remembered everyone’s birthdays and made sure volunteers had gloves.

Noel hurried down the steps. “Thank God,” Noel said, breath puffing white. “Wes. Sam.”

Wes lifted the muffin bag. “I brought bribes.”

Noel’s eyes almost teared up. “I love you.”

Wes pointed with a muffin. “Don’t get weird.”

Noel snatched the bag like it contained the last surviving joy in town. “No promises.”

Eben approached with the controlled grace of a man who would alphabetize a fire.

He stopped beside Noel and nodded at Wes. “Candle.”

Wes nodded back. “Frost.”

Eben’s gaze flicked to Sam. “Rook.”

Sam’s voice stayed even. “Frost.”

Wes looked between them. “This is like a spreadsheet met a police report.”

Noel made a distressed sound. “Okay. Emergency. The tree truck called. It’s stuck on Ridge Road. There’s ice, and apparently the driver ‘doesn’t feel safe’ which is fair, but also, I am going to dissolve into glitter and scream.”

Eben’s eyes narrowed slightly. “We will not be screaming.”

Noel’s jaw clenched. “We might.”

Eben’s gaze stayed on him. “Noel.”

Noel’s shoulders twitched like he was about to argue purely out of muscle memory.

Then Noel did something surprising.

He exhaled.

“Fine,” Noel said, too sharp, but he said it anyway. “No screaming. Yet.”

Eben’s posture eased by half an inch like Noel had just complied with a safety protocol.

Wes watched it happen, a little fascinated. Noel had a type. Eben was that type. Noel was going to suffer.

Sam spoke up, calm as ever. “Truck is stuck where.”

Noel shoved his phone out. “Ridge Road. Past the old covered bridge.”

Eben nodded once, taking control without making it a fight. “We need to reroute. We need a smaller vehicle to bring the ornaments and base supplies. We need a tow option, or a tractor.”

Wes blinked. “A tractor.”

Noel pointed at Wes like he’d been waiting for this moment. “Harold Gibbons.”

Wes sighed. “Of course.”

Sam looked mildly impressed. “You have a tractor guy.”

Wes looked at Sam. “We have a guy for everything. This is a small town. People specialize.”

Eben’s gaze flicked to the volunteers. “We keep them here. We give them tasks that feel useful.”

Noel nodded fast. “Yes. Yes. Usefulness. The town’s love language.”

Wes held up the muffin bag Noel had stolen. “And muffins.”

Noel looked at the volunteers like he was about to deliver a sermon. “Okay, everyone! Slight delay! But we have muffins and an updated schedule and I’m not panicking!”

One volunteer squinted. “You look like you’re panicking.”

Noel smiled too brightly. “I’m radiating holiday spirit.”

Wes leaned in to Sam, voice low. “He’s lying.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I noticed.”

Eben turned to Noel. “Assign them to indoor prep. Garland sorting. Stage setup. Cocoa station. Anything that moves the plan forward.”

Noel nodded, already shifting into command mode. “Right. Yes. Cocoa station. Glitter-free cocoa station.”

Wes raised a hand. “I can take two volunteers and start the cocoa station.”

Noel grabbed his arm. “Bless you.”

Wes stared at Noel’s hand on his sleeve. Then at Sam, whose gaze had sharpened in a way that made Wes’s stomach flip. Not angry. Not possessive. Just… attentive.

Noel let go quickly, oblivious. “Okay! Sam, Eben, you go do… man things. Tractor things. Ice things. Don’t die.”

Eben nodded once. “We won’t.”

Sam said, “We’ll handle it.”

Noel turned to Wes, lowering his voice like this was confidential. “Can you keep them occupied so they don’t riot.”

Wes glanced at the volunteers. One of them already had her arms crossed in the universal posture of *I woke up early for this.*

Wes sighed. “I’ll distract them with sugar and false purpose.”

Noel squeezed Wes’s shoulder like Wes was a life raft. “Thank you.”

Then Noel spun back to the group, voice bright. “Everyone inside! We’re making the cocoa station the cutest thing you’ve ever seen!”

The volunteers moved, grumbling but interested. Muffins were strong propaganda.

Wes started to follow, then felt Sam’s presence beside him.

Sam leaned in slightly, voice low enough that only Wes could hear. “You okay.”

Wes blinked. “You’re copying Eben now?”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Answer the question.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He glanced at Sam’s eyes, steady and warm, and felt his own defenses wobble.

“I’m… fine,” Wes started automatically.

Sam’s brow lifted a fraction.

Wes exhaled. “I’m good,” he corrected, quieter. “Just… not used to this.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Being helped.”

Wes swallowed. “Being… seen.”

Sam didn’t move, didn’t push, just held Wes’s gaze like it was safe to do so in the middle of a chaotic Christmas crisis.

Sam’s voice was low. “I see you.”

Wes’s chest tightened so hard he almost laughed.

Wes muttered, “This is going to make me insufferable.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Too late.”

Wes snorted, grateful for the joke. “Go do your tractor ice thing.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’ll be back.”

Wes’s pulse jumped. “That’s not necessary.”

Sam’s gaze didn’t waver. “It is.”

Wes stared at him for a beat, then nodded once, because apparently that was his new thing too.

Sam started to turn, then paused. His gaze dipped briefly to Wes’s mouth and back up, quick as a thought.

“Later,” Sam said, voice quiet.

Wes’s breath caught. “Later,” he echoed, even quieter.

Sam left with Eben, their coats disappearing into the snow toward the parking lot.

Wes watched them go for one stupid second too long, then shook himself and marched inside to face the only thing scarier than feelings.

Volunteer management.

Inside, Merryweather Hall buzzed with that frantic pre-festival energy. Noel was already assigning tasks with the desperate cheer of a man holding a dam together with tape.

Wes grabbed two volunteers, pointed them toward the cocoa supplies, and started building a station that looked festive enough to distract people from the fact that Christmas itself was currently stuck on Ridge Road.

As he worked, Wes kept catching himself looking toward the door, listening for footsteps.

Waiting.

Because apparently Sam Rook had kissed him once and now Wes’s brain was doing the most embarrassing thing possible.

It was hoping.

**[STOP WRITING]**

---

If you want the next chunk, I’ll take it into: **Sam/Eben on the ice road** (competence + banter), then **Sam returns** (small moment), then **Wes’s first real “I want” admission** (still cozy, still low stakes, still delicious).




Cool. That’s the human equivalent of “the motor is running, I guess.” So I’ll keep rolling.

---

Sam’s truck smelled faintly of coffee and clean upholstery, like Sam had opinions about not living in chaos.

Eben sat in the passenger seat with a clipboard balanced on his knee like it was a weapon. He didn’t fidget. He didn’t sigh. He didn’t do anything except stare out the windshield at the snow-slick road like he was judging it personally.

Sam kept both hands on the wheel, calm and steady as the heater fought to turn winter into something survivable.

After three minutes of silence, Eben said, “Ridge Road is always a problem.”

Sam’s eyes stayed forward. “Because people drive it like they’re immortal.”

Eben nodded once. “Correct.”

Sam glanced sideways. “You’re not from here.”

Eben’s gaze didn’t move. “No.”

Sam waited.

Eben added, like it explained everything, “I worked municipal logistics in three cities that hated joy.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, barely. “This town loves joy.”

Eben’s tone was flat. “That is why it requires more containment.”

Sam snorted softly. “You and Noel are going to be a spectacle.”

Eben’s eyes flicked to him. “Noel panics loudly.”

Sam’s gaze stayed forward. “And you don’t panic at all.”

Eben’s jaw tightened slightly, like Sam had stepped near a boundary. “I plan.”

Sam didn’t push. He just nodded. “He needs that.”

Eben’s gaze drifted to the snow swirling past the headlights. “He needs rest.”

Sam’s hands tightened on the wheel for half a second. “Yeah.”

They drove in silence again, but it was different now. Not cold. Just… focused. Two men who understood responsibility like it was a second language.

The truck turned onto Ridge Road, and immediately the world shifted.

The snow was thicker here, the road narrower, the trees leaning in like they were listening. Ice glittered along the edges where the plows had missed. The kind of road that made you instinctively stop talking.

Sam slowed, tires crunching.

Ahead, hazard lights blinked in the white: the tree truck, angled slightly, half on the shoulder, like it had given up.

A man in a high-vis jacket stood beside it, waving his arms in the universal sign for *I regret all my decisions*.

Sam pulled in behind the truck and set the parking brake.

Eben was already unbuckling. “We need traction. Salt. Tow. Or a tractor.”

Sam opened the door and stepped out into the cold. The air hit like a slap.

The driver hurried over. “I’m not taking this thing another inch,” he said, voice tight. “It slid twice. The trailer’s swinging. If I lose it, it’s going in the ditch.”

Sam nodded once. “You did the right thing stopping.”

The man blinked, visibly startled by calm. “I did?”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “Yeah. Nobody needs a headline about a Christmas tree dying on Ridge Road.”

The driver let out a shaky laugh. “Thank you.”

Eben stepped closer, gaze sweeping the scene. “What’s your last stable point.”

The driver frowned. “My what.”

Eben pointed with the clipboard like he was conducting. “Where the truck felt safe. Where you last had full control.”

The driver stared at him, then nodded slowly. “Back at the turn. Near the covered bridge.”

Eben’s jaw tightened. “So we’re stuck between two bad choices.”

Sam looked down the road at the glazed surface, then at the slope near the shoulder. “We need a pull from the front. Gentle. Controlled.”

The driver spread his hands. “I called dispatch. Tow is an hour out.”

Eben’s voice was flat. “That’s too long. Volunteers will freeze and riot.”

Sam’s phone buzzed again.

Sam checked it. A text from Noel:
**NOEL:** *I’m being brave. How long. I need facts before I invent doom.*
Sam typed with his thumb:
**SAM:** *We’re here. You’re fine. Start indoor tasks. Bribe with muffins. ETA unknown, working it.*

Eben watched Sam type, then looked at the driver. “Do you have chains.”

The driver grimaced. “On the truck. Trailer doesn’t.”

Eben nodded like this was the worst kind of answer. “Of course it doesn’t.”

Sam blew out a breath. “We need Harold Gibbons.”

Eben turned slightly. “The tractor.”

Sam nodded. “The tractor.”

Eben’s gaze sharpened. “Call him.”

Sam already had his phone out.

---

Harold Gibbons picked up on the third ring, sounding like he’d been awake since 4 a.m. out of pure stubbornness.

“Rook.”

Sam didn’t waste time. “Harold, we need the tractor on Ridge Road. Tree truck’s stuck.”

A pause. Then Harold’s voice, warm with righteous purpose. “Finally. I been waiting all year for someone to admit they need me.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Can you come now.”

Harold snorted. “Son, I’m already in my boots.”

---

Eben exhaled through his nose, a sound that was not quite relief and not quite annoyance. “This town is… strange.”

Sam glanced at him. “You’re not wrong.”

Eben’s gaze shifted back to the truck. “When Harold arrives, we need the tractor to pull the trailer straight. Minimal angle. No sudden torque.”

Sam’s brow lifted. “You know tractors.”

Eben’s expression didn’t change. “I know physics. Tractors are just stubborn physics.”

Sam huffed a quiet laugh.

Eben looked at him, faintly surprised.

Sam didn’t stop smiling. It was brief, but it happened.

Eben stared like he’d witnessed an eclipse.

Then Eben’s gaze slid away again, voice dry. “Don’t get comfortable. This is still a municipal disaster.”

Sam’s smile faded into something softer. “Yeah.”

---

Twenty minutes later, the tractor arrived like a myth.

Harold Gibbons rolled up in a battered machine that sounded like it had eaten a muffler and decided it liked the taste. He wore a thick coat, a plaid hat, and the satisfied expression of a man who’d been proven right by the universe.

He hopped down and stomped through the snow. “Which one of you is in charge.”

Eben stepped forward without hesitation. “Me.”

Harold squinted at him. “You look like a man who alphabetizes his socks.”

Eben’s tone was flat. “Do you want this tree in town or not.”

Harold grinned, delighted. “I like you.”

Sam watched, amused, as Eben explained the pull angle with crisp precision while Harold nodded like he’d found his people.

The tractor hooked up.

The pull began.

Slow. Controlled. The trailer eased forward like it didn’t want to admit it had been scared.

The driver exhaled so hard he practically deflated.

Sam watched the rig straighten, then checked his phone.

He texted Noel:
**SAM:** *Tree is moving. Tractor miracle. You can stop imagining doom (for now).*

Noel replied instantly:
**NOEL:** *I imagined doom for sport. Proud of you. Tell Eben he’s terrifying but useful.*

Sam pocketed the phone.

Eben glanced at him. “Update.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Noel says you’re terrifying but useful.”

Eben nodded once, like he’d been given a performance review. “Acceptable.”

Sam couldn’t help it. He laughed, quiet and real.

Eben looked mildly offended by the concept of laughter in a crisis.

Then Eben said, very evenly, “We should return before Noel starts making contingency banners.”

Sam nodded. “Yeah.”

But as Sam climbed back into the truck, he found his thoughts tugging toward Candle & Crumb.

Toward Wes.

Toward the way Wes had said “Okay” like it cost him something.

Sam started the engine and drove back toward town, steady hands on the wheel, calm face, heart doing something annoyingly unprofessional.

---

Back at Merryweather Hall, the doors opened to a blast of warmth and noise.

Volunteers were inside, sorting garlands, setting up tables, arguing about ribbon color like it was state policy. The cocoa station was half-built and already charming.

Wes Candle stood behind it in an apron, hair still chaotic, cheeks flushed from exertion and heat. He was gesturing with a ladle like he was conducting an orchestra.

Wes looked up.

He saw Sam.

And the smallest thing happened: Wes’s shoulders dropped.

Like his body had been waiting for Sam to come back before it believed the world was stable.

Sam felt it in his chest, sharp and quiet.

He crossed the room.

Wes tried to look unimpressed and failed. “So you didn’t die.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Disappointing, I know.”

Wes’s eyes warmed. “I had a whole speech ready.”

Sam stopped beside the cocoa station. “Tree’s moving. Harold did tractor magic.”

Wes exhaled hard. “Bless Harold Gibbons.”

Sam’s gaze held Wes’s for a beat too long. “You ate.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “That is not the first thing you say after a crisis.”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “It is to you.”

Wes blinked, caught.

Wes cleared his throat, reaching for a mug like it was safer than the way Sam was looking at him. “So, um. Cocoa.”

Sam’s eyes flicked to the mug, then back. “Are you offering.”

Wes huffed. “I am bribing you. It’s different.”

Sam took the mug. Their fingers brushed.

Wes went still.

Sam didn’t move away.

Wes’s voice came out quieter. “You came back.”

Sam’s expression softened. “I said I would.”

Wes swallowed. Then, like it slipped out before he could stop it, he said, “Good.”

Sam’s pulse kicked.

Sam leaned in slightly, voice low enough that only Wes could hear. “You doing okay.”

Wes stared at him, cheeks warming, eyes steady in a way that looked like he was trying to be brave.

Then Wes said, quiet and honest, “I’m… better when you’re here.”

Sam held still. No jokes. No teasing. Just the truth hanging between them like a light.

Sam nodded once, slow. “Okay.”

Wes let out a shaky breath and looked away, muttering, “Don’t make it a thing.”

Sam took a sip of cocoa. “Too late.”

Wes’s mouth twitched, almost a smile.

Outside, a distant engine rumbled. The tree truck arriving, finally.

Inside, Noel’s voice rose in delighted relief, and the volunteers cheered like Christmas had been personally rescued.

Wes looked at Sam over the rim of his ladle, eyes soft.

Sam looked back, steady.

Low stakes, sure.

But Wes Candle’s heart was starting to feel like the biggest thing in the room.

**[STOP WRITING]**



Tree trucks have a special talent: arriving late and acting like they did you a favor.

The rig rolled into Evergreen Square with hazard lights blinking, Harold Gibbons trundling behind it like a triumphant chaperone. The crowd’s cheer rose up in a warm wave, volunteers clapping and laughing like they hadn’t just spent an hour fantasizing about arson and mutiny.

Noel appeared at the doors of Merryweather Hall like a man summoned by chaos.

He burst outside, clipboard in hand, scarf flung over one shoulder, and practically jogged down the steps toward the arriving truck.

“YOU’RE HERE!” Noel shouted.

The driver leaned out the window. “We’re here!”

Noel pointed at the tree like it was personally accountable. “You’re LATE!”

The driver shrugged helplessly. “We’re alive!”

Noel looked like he wanted to argue with mortality, then took a breath like Eben had trained him to.

“No screaming,” Noel muttered to himself.

Eben stepped up beside Noel, calm and unimpressed by everyone’s emotional volume. “We proceed,” Eben said, like it wasn’t a miracle and more of a scheduled occurrence. “Unload. Secure. Crane.”

Noel nodded fast. “Yes. Yes. Proceed. You heard the terrifying man, everybody. Proceed.”

Wes watched from inside the hall, ladle in hand, cocoa steam curling around his face like a warm excuse.

Sam stood beside the cocoa station with his mug, watching the square the way he watched everything. Calm. Protective. Like he could hold the whole morning steady with just his gaze.

Wes tried not to stare at Sam’s mouth while Sam sipped cocoa.

He failed, again.

Sam’s eyes flicked to him.

Wes immediately looked at the marshmallows like they were fascinating. “So,” Wes said, because silence was dangerous and also because he was apparently incapable of not poking at things, “you’re just… staying.”

Sam’s gaze stayed on the window, but his voice was low. “For now.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “For what.”

Sam finally looked at him, eyes steady. “For you.”

Wes blinked.

That landed too clean. Too direct. Like Sam was building a house out of honest statements and Wes was still standing there holding a match.

Wes scoffed to recover. “You’re going to get bored. I’m not that interesting. I’m mostly carbohydrates and coping mechanisms.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I disagree.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. He pretended to fuss with the cocoa cups. “Sure you do.”

Sam’s voice was quiet. “Wes.”

Wes froze at his name.

Sam didn’t touch him. He didn’t crowd him. He just waited like last time, like Wes got to choose what happened next.

Wes swallowed. “What.”

Sam nodded toward the door. “Come outside for a minute.”

Wes’s pulse jumped. “Why.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Because you’ve been vibrating like you’re about to bolt.”

Wes opened his mouth to deny it, but his body betrayed him by… continuing to vibrate.

Wes huffed. “Fine. One minute. If anyone steals the cocoa, I’m pressing charges.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’ll guard it.”

Wes stared at him. “You’re literally a cop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Exactly.”

Wes rolled his eyes and followed Sam through the hall and out the side door, stepping into the cold behind Merryweather Hall where it was quieter. Snow muffled everything. The sound of the crowd was distant, softened.

Wes crossed his arms, breath puffing white. “Okay. We’re outside. I’m outdoors-ing.”

Sam stood close but not too close, shoulders blocking some of the wind without making a big deal of it. He took a slow breath and watched Wes’s face.

“You’re doing a lot,” Sam said.

Wes scoffed automatically. “I’m doing normal.”

Sam didn’t blink. “You’re doing too much.”

Wes’s mouth tightened. “We’re all doing too much. It’s Christmas.”

Sam’s gaze sharpened gently. “You use that like an excuse.”

Wes opened his mouth.

Then closed it again.

Because yeah.

Wes exhaled, long and slow, trying to get his ribs to stop feeling tight. “I don’t know how to… not.”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “You don’t have to know how. You just have to let someone help.”

Wes looked away, jaw clenched. “People helping is messy.”

Sam nodded once. “Sometimes.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “And then they leave.”

The words slipped out before Wes could stop them.

He hated that. He hated the silence that followed. He hated that he’d given away something soft like he was handing Sam a knife.

Sam didn’t rush. He didn’t try to fix it with a speech. He just stood there, eyes on Wes, and let the truth exist without punishing Wes for saying it.

Then Sam said, very quietly, “I’m not leaving.”

Wes’s breath caught.

Wes let out a short laugh that sounded wrong. “You don’t know that.”

Sam’s gaze didn’t waver. “I do.”

Wes stared at him, heart pounding like it wanted to fight for its life.

Wes whispered, “Why.”

Sam’s voice was calm, but there was something warmer under it now. “Because I like being around you.”

Wes’s cheeks burned. “That’s not a real reason.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “It’s a better reason than the mayor.”

Wes swallowed hard and looked down at the snow by his boots. His fingers curled tight inside his sleeves.

“This is going to get complicated,” Wes muttered.

Sam’s gaze softened. “Maybe.”

Wes’s voice went even quieter. “And I’m bad at complicated.”

Sam took a slow step closer, careful, giving Wes time to move back.

Wes didn’t.

Sam stopped within reach, eyes steady. “Then we don’t do complicated,” Sam said. “We do simple.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Simple like… what.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to Wes’s mouth and back to his eyes. “Simple like I check on you. You let me. We take it one day at a time.”

Wes stared at him, chest aching in a way that felt unfair.

Then Wes said, quiet and stubborn, “And the rules.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Rules.”

Wes nodded fast, grateful for structure. “Yes. Rules. Like… no public chaos.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Hugh will violate that immediately.”

Wes huffed a laugh, relief cracking through. “Okay, fine. Minimal public chaos.”

Sam nodded. “Agreed.”

Wes swallowed. “And… you don’t get to make me promise things I can’t keep.”

Sam’s expression softened, serious now. “I won’t.”

Wes blinked, throat tight. “Promise.”

Sam’s gaze held his like a vow. “I promise.”

Wes exhaled, shaky.

Sam’s hand lifted, slow. He didn’t touch Wes. He hovered, waiting.

“May I,” Sam asked.

Wes’s pulse skittered. He nodded once. “Yeah.”

Sam’s fingers settled lightly at the back of Wes’s neck, warm through the hoodie. The touch was gentle and grounding, like Sam was anchoring Wes back into his own body.

Wes made a small sound in his throat that he would absolutely deny in court.

Sam leaned in and kissed him again, soft and brief. A promise, not a demand.

Wes’s hands fisted in Sam’s coat automatically, like his body was done pretending it didn’t want this.

Sam pulled back just enough to murmur, “Still okay.”

Wes’s voice came out wrecked. “Yes.”

Sam’s thumb stroked once at Wes’s neck, and Wes shivered.

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Good.”

Wes hated that word now. Hated how it lit him up and calmed him down at the same time.

Wes swallowed, forehead tipping forward until it rested against Sam’s for a second. “If you keep doing that,” Wes whispered, “I’m going to start expecting it.”

Sam’s voice was quiet and steady. “Okay.”

Wes blinked. “That’s not…”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “It’s an answer.”

Wes stared at him, then let out a breath that turned into a reluctant laugh. “You’re ridiculous.”

Sam’s gaze stayed on him. “Yeah.”

Behind them, a cheer erupted as the crane finally lifted the massive tree upright in the square.

Wes turned his head slightly to watch, and Sam stayed close, hand still at Wes’s neck, like he wasn’t letting go just because the town needed its centerpiece.

Wes’s chest tightened with something that felt dangerously like happiness.

Then, of course, the universe ruined the moment.

A voice called from the side alley, loud and delighted: “WES CANDLE.”

Wes froze.

Sam’s hand stilled.

Wes closed his eyes. “No.”

Hugh Everhart appeared around the corner like a festive ghost, eyes shining, scarf flaring dramatically in the wind.

Hugh’s gaze snapped to Wes. Then to Sam. Then to the fact that Sam’s hand was at Wes’s neck.

Hugh gasped with the force of a carol finale. “OH MY GOD.”

Wes opened his eyes and glared. “Hugh.”

Hugh clasped his hands under his chin like he was witnessing sacred art. “This is the best day of my life.”

Wes hissed, “Go away.”

Hugh ignored him completely and looked at Sam. “Officer Rook,” Hugh said solemnly, “thank you for your service.”

Sam’s expression didn’t change, but his eyes warmed with amusement. “You’re welcome.”

Wes groaned. “I hate both of you.”

Hugh bounced closer, vibrating with gossip energy. “Is this a thing. Is it a *thing thing.*”

Wes pointed a finger at Hugh like it was a warning label. “If you say the words ‘thing thing’ again, I’m throwing you into the snow.”

Hugh blinked innocently. “You wouldn’t.”

Wes smiled sweetly. “Try me.”

Sam’s hand slipped away from Wes’s neck, not because Sam wanted distance, but because Hugh had the timing of a disaster.

Sam leaned in slightly and murmured near Wes’s ear, “We can continue this later.”

Wes’s pulse jumped. “Stop saying ‘later’ like it’s a guarantee.”

Sam’s voice was quiet. “It is.”

Wes swallowed hard and glared at Hugh to avoid melting on the spot.

Hugh pointed between them. “I knew it. I KNEW it.”

Wes grabbed Hugh by the scarf and started herding him back toward the hall. “You need a job,” Wes muttered.

Hugh perked up instantly. “I love jobs.”

Wes shoved him toward the supply closet door. “Good. You’re on glitter containment.”

Hugh gasped. “An honor.”

Sam’s low chuckle followed them, warm as cocoa.

Wes tried not to smile.

He failed.

And out in Evergreen Square, the tree stood tall at last, lights blinking on one by one, like the whole town had decided to keep going.

Wes Candle, against all his instincts, decided he might keep going too.

With help.

**[STOP WRITING]**


Wes shoved Hugh into the supply closet like he was filing a problem into a drawer.

“Glitter containment,” Wes said, deadly calm. “If I find a single sparkle particle outside this room, I’m billing you for emotional damages.”

Hugh clutched the box of ribbon like it was sacred. “I accept this responsibility with reverence.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “And silence.”

Hugh blinked. “I can’t promise silence.”

Wes pointed. “Try.”

Sam’s quiet laugh followed them as Wes slammed the closet door with the kind of finality that suggested Hugh might live there now.

Wes exhaled and turned back toward the hall.

The moment he stepped inside, Merryweather Hall hit him full force: warmth, noise, and the frantic hum of a hundred small tasks pretending to be a plan.

Noel was at the front with a clipboard and a megawatt smile, corralling volunteers like a man who’d decided chaos would not win today.

Eben stood two steps behind him like a composed shadow, arms crossed, gaze sweeping the room with the calm of a man who had already written three contingency plans in his head.

The tree lights in Evergreen Square blinked in through the big front windows, bright and triumphant now, like nothing had ever gone wrong.

Wes looked around at the cocoa station, the garlands being sorted, the folding tables being set, the volunteers laughing again, and felt a weird twist in his chest.

They’d done it.

Not perfectly. Not smoothly. But they’d done it.

Wes stepped back behind the cocoa station and grabbed the ladle again like it was his rightful scepter.

“Okay!” Wes called, voice carrying, because if you spoke like you belonged in charge, people tended to believe you. “Hot cocoa is now available for anyone who does not threaten to riot!”

A few volunteers cheered.

Noel turned toward Wes and mouthed, *thank you* with visible gratitude.

Wes waved him off like it was nothing, because Wes Candle could perform competence in his sleep.

Sam drifted back into the hall a moment later, shaking snow from his coat, looking composed like he hadn’t just dragged a Christmas tree delivery out of the jaws of icy doom.

Wes’s eyes found him without permission.

Sam’s gaze caught Wes’s for a beat, steady and warm.

Wes’s throat tightened.

Wes immediately turned to pour cocoa like it was life-or-death.

Because it kind of was.

Hugh’s muffled voice floated from the supply closet: “WHO WANTS TO HEAR A ROMANTIC DEVELOPMENT.”

Wes didn’t even look up. “NO ONE.”

A volunteer near the garlands perked up. “Wait, what romantic development?”

Wes slammed a mug onto the counter with a little too much force. “Cocoa. Drink. Forget everything.”

Sam stepped closer, close enough to be heard only by Wes. “He’s going to tell them.”

Wes hissed, “I will end him.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “He won’t if you give him a job.”

“I gave him a job,” Wes muttered. “Glitter prison.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “He’ll escape.”

Wes glared at him. “Stop being right.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes’s pulse jumped. Annoying.

Noel clapped his hands loudly at the front. “Okay! Attention everyone!”

The room quieted in messy increments.

Noel held up his clipboard like it was a flag. “First: the tree is up. We are not dying. That’s a win.”

A cheer went up.

Noel’s shoulders visibly loosened like he’d been holding his breath for hours.

Eben leaned in slightly and murmured something near Noel’s ear.

Noel nodded and continued, voice steadier now. “Second: we’re shifting the schedule by thirty minutes for set-up. It’s fine. You’re fine. I’m fine.”

Someone called, “You don’t look fine!”

Noel smiled too brightly. “I’m fine in a festive way.”

Wes snorted.

Sam’s shoulder brushed Wes’s as he leaned in. “He’s trying.”

Wes’s voice went quieter. “He’s always trying.”

Sam’s gaze stayed on Noel, but his voice softened. “Yeah.”

Noel pointed down the volunteer list. “I need two people on stage support, four on decoration, and one person who is willing to wrestle the inflatable snowman into submission.”

A hand shot up. “I’ll do it.”

Noel pointed like he’d just knighted someone. “Bless you. You are a hero.”

Eben stepped forward, calm and surgical. “Safety note. The snowman’s anchor points must be secured. If it becomes airborne, it is a hazard.”

The volunteer blinked. “It can become airborne?”

Eben’s gaze was flat. “Everything can become airborne.”

Wes muttered to Sam, “I love him.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “You don’t.”

Wes didn’t deny it fast enough.

Sam’s gaze slid to him.

Wes immediately coughed and busied himself with marshmallows.

Hugh’s voice rose again from the closet, muffled but determined: “I HAVE IMPORTANT NEWS.”

Wes snapped, “NO YOU DON’T.”

Hugh shouted, “I DO. IT’S ABOUT THE BAKER AND THE COP.”

The room went very still.

Wes froze mid-ladle.

Noel’s head snapped toward the closet, eyes widening with the force of a man who loved gossip but also loved not dying today.

Eben’s eyes narrowed like he was about to draft a policy against Hugh.

A volunteer whispered, delighted, “The baker and the cop?”

Wes’s face went nuclear.

Sam’s posture stayed calm, but his eyes flicked to Wes, checking.

Wes made a decision in a single furious heartbeat.

He marched to the closet door, yanked it open, and stared at Hugh with the dead-eyed patience of a man holding a knife made of cinnamon sticks.

“Hugh,” Wes said, voice low and dangerous, “if you say one more word, I will assign you to mop duty for the rest of the season.”

Hugh went pale. “You wouldn’t.”

Wes smiled sweetly. “Try me.”

Hugh swallowed. His eyes flicked past Wes to Sam, who was watching with quiet amusement.

Hugh raised one finger. “Okay. Fine. I won’t announce it.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Good.”

Hugh brightened immediately. “I will imply it subtly through crafts.”

Wes shut his eyes. “No.”

Hugh clasped his hands. “It’s called foreshadowing.”

Wes pointed at a bin of plain brown paper. “You. Paper-only.”

Hugh gasped like he’d been stabbed. “That’s cruel.”

Wes’s voice stayed flat. “I am capable of cruelty.”

Eben’s voice cut in from behind them. “Everhart.”

Hugh turned slowly, like a man being addressed by the law itself.

Eben’s gaze was calm and terrifying. “You will not create rumors that destabilize the volunteer corps.”

Hugh blinked. “Rumors build community.”

Eben didn’t blink. “Rumors create inefficiency.”

Hugh looked horrified. “You’re allergic to joy.”

Eben’s gaze stayed steady. “Correct.”

Hugh clutched his scarf dramatically. “Fine. I will be… silent.”

Wes stared. “You can do that?”

Hugh looked insulted. “I can do anything. I’m just choosing not to most of the time.”

Wes pointed back into the closet. “Paper-only. Quietly. With your mouth closed.”

Hugh sighed. “I’m oppressed.”

Wes shut the closet door again and leaned his forehead against it for one second.

Sam stepped up beside him, voice low. “You handled that.”

Wes exhaled. “If I handled it any harder, he’d explode into glitter.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You’re blushing.”

Wes jerked upright. “I am not.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “You are.”

Wes glared. “Stop looking at me.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “No.”

Wes’s pulse jumped again, traitor.

Noel popped up beside them with a grin like he’d been holding it in. “So,” Noel said brightly, “the baker and the cop.”

Wes’s eyes widened. “Noel.”

Noel held up both hands. “I’m not judging. I’m thriving.”

Wes hissed, “We are not making it a town thing.”

Noel’s grin softened into something kinder. “Okay,” Noel said, unexpectedly gentle. “Your thing.”

Wes blinked.

Noel leaned in slightly, voice dropping. “But also, I’m happy for you.”

Wes’s throat tightened, inconveniently. “Don’t.”

Noel smiled. “I won’t make it weird.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “You can’t promise that.”

Noel looked offended. “I absolutely can. I’m a professional.”

Eben appeared behind Noel like a consequence. “He is not.”

Noel pointed at Eben without looking. “Shh. I’m being supportive.”

Wes swallowed hard and nodded once, like that was the only form of acceptance he could tolerate.

Noel patted his arm quickly. “Okay. I have to go make sure the snowman doesn’t become airborne.”

Eben said, “It will.”

Noel looked over his shoulder, horrified. “Don’t manifest that!”

Eben’s tone was flat. “I’m predicting it.”

Noel sprinted away.

Eben lingered for a beat, gaze sliding to Sam, then to Wes.

“You,” Eben said to Sam, “keep him fed.”

Wes blinked. “Excuse me?”

Eben’s gaze didn’t move. “He forgets.”

Wes sputtered. “I do not forget. I… prioritize.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “He forgets.”

Wes glared at both of them. “Traitors.”

Eben nodded once, like he’d completed his duty, and moved away to inspect the stage setup with the solemnity of a man reviewing a bridge.

Wes stared after him, then turned back to Sam. “Did I just get assigned a caretaker.”

Sam’s voice was low, amused. “Sounds like it.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed again. “I hate this.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “No, you don’t.”

Wes opened his mouth to argue.

Then a volunteer stepped up, nervous smile in place. “Hi, Wes? The cocoa is… amazing. Also, can I ask you a question.”

Wes straightened instantly, competence snapping into place. “Yes.”

The volunteer hesitated, glancing at Sam like Sam was intimidating by default. “Is Officer Rook going to be… around more this season.”

Wes froze.

Sam stayed calm, eyes on Wes, silently letting Wes choose what to say.

Wes swallowed. His heart thudded like it was trying to sabotage him.

Wes forced a smile that didn’t feel like lying. “Sam’s helping with safety,” Wes said, firm and simple. “The festival needs him.”

Sam’s eyes warmed, approving.

The volunteer brightened. “Oh good. He makes everyone feel safe.”

Wes’s chest tightened at that. He nodded once. “Yeah,” Wes said quietly. “He does.”

The volunteer wandered off, satisfied.

Wes let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.

Sam leaned in slightly, voice low. “You did good.”

Wes’s pulse jumped.

Wes muttered, “Stop saying that.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “No.”

Wes stared at him, then shook his head like he could shake off how much he liked it.

Wes grabbed a fresh mug and shoved it toward Sam like it was a peace offering and an accusation. “More cocoa.”

Sam took it. Their fingers brushed.

Wes’s breath caught.

Sam’s eyes flicked to his, steady. “Later,” Sam murmured again, like a promise he had every intention of keeping.

Wes swallowed, cheeks warm. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “That sounded fake.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “It was.”

Wes huffed a laugh despite himself, and the sound felt like something loosening inside him.

Outside, the tree lights glowed brighter as the square filled with people, music starting up somewhere near the stage. The festival was moving forward, messy and alive.

Wes looked out the window at the crowd gathering, then back at Sam.

Wes’s voice came out quiet, almost surprised by its own honesty. “If we’re doing this,” Wes said, low, “we’re doing it slow.”

Sam’s gaze softened, serious now. “Okay.”

Wes swallowed. “And private.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay.”

Wes hesitated, then forced the hardest part out. “And… you don’t leave without telling me.”

Sam’s expression didn’t change much, but something in his eyes warmed like a steady light. “I won’t.”

Wes blinked. “Promise.”

Sam’s voice was calm and absolute. “I promise.”

Wes exhaled, shaky, and looked away fast, because if he looked at Sam too long, he might do something reckless like trust him.

Sam’s voice came gentle, close. “After this,” Sam said, “I’m walking you home.”

Wes’s chest tightened.

Wes muttered, “I can walk.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I know.”

Wes’s throat tightened at that, stupidly. He nodded once.

Outside, someone started a countdown for the official lighting moment, voices rising together.

Ten.

Nine.

Eight.

Wes stood behind the cocoa station with warm mugs lined up like offerings.

Sam stood beside him like a steady wall.

And when the crowd hit **one** and the square erupted in light, Wes felt Sam’s shoulder brush his.

Not accidental.

Not performative.

Just there.

Wes’s breath caught, and for a second, he let himself lean back into it.

Just a little.

Just enough.

Because maybe, for once, he didn’t have to hold everything alone.

**[STOP WRITING]**


Wes didn’t mean to lean.

It just… happened. Like his body recognized steadiness and took it without asking his pride first.

Sam didn’t react like it was a big deal. He didn’t stiffen. Didn’t turn it into a moment. He just stayed there, shoulder warm against Wes’s, while the square exploded into light and noise and applause.

Noel, somewhere near the steps, looked like he might cry with relief and fury at the same time.

Hugh, inevitably, was already trying to lead a chant that sounded suspiciously like it would become gossip later.

Wes focused on the cocoa. On the mugs. On the volunteers. On anything except the quiet satisfaction in his chest that felt like a dangerous new ingredient.

“Cocoa,” Wes announced, loud enough to carry. “Hot. Sweet. Available to anyone who doesn’t ask me personal questions.”

Someone in the crowd yelled, “TOO LATE.”

Wes grimaced. “I hate all of you.”

Sam’s voice, low near his ear: “They like you.”

Wes muttered, “They like free sugar.”

Sam took a sip from his mug. “They also like you.”

Wes’s face went warm. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes made a strangled sound and aggressively sprinkled marshmallows like he could physically distract himself.

The first wave of townsfolk hit the cocoa station like it was a pilgrimage site. Wes went into muscle memory: pour, stir, smile, accept compliments, refuse tips, pretend he wasn’t exhausted.

Sam hovered just to the side, never in the way, but always present. He redirected a kid who tried to shove ahead, gently. He moved a wobbly table back into place with one hand. He caught a mug before it tipped and spilled.

Wes watched him do it and felt something in his chest squeeze, soft and stupid.

You could build a life around that kind of quiet competence.

Wes immediately told himself to shut up.

After the rush eased, Noel swept by, cheeks flushed, eyes bright, scarf askew.

He stopped at the station, leaned in, and whispered, “The tree is up. We didn’t die. Eben is smiling internally.”

Wes snorted. “Liar.”

Noel looked offended. “He blinked slower. That’s basically joy.”

Eben appeared behind Noel like he’d been summoned by the mention of his name. “We have a next task.”

Noel pivoted instantly. “Yes. We love tasks.”

Eben’s gaze slid to the schedule board they’d taped to the wall. “Parade staging begins in twenty minutes. We need barricades moved, and the stage sound check is behind.”

Noel nodded, then glanced at Wes, softer. “You okay.”

Wes opened his mouth to say *fine.*

Sam’s gaze landed on him, steady.

Wes exhaled. “I’m… good,” Wes said. “Just busy.”

Noel’s face softened, genuinely pleased, like Wes had just performed a miracle. “Okay. Good.”

Then Noel was gone again, swallowed by duty.

Eben lingered half a beat longer, eyes scanning the cocoa station with the severity of a man assessing structural integrity.

“Candle,” Eben said.

Wes braced. “Yes.”

Eben nodded once. “Adequate.”

Wes blinked. “Was that… praise.”

Eben’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t make it weird.”

Wes stared after him as he walked away. “I hate him,” Wes muttered.

Sam’s voice was low. “No, you don’t.”

Wes glared. “Stop doing that.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “That one sounded real.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “It was.”

Wes’s stomach flipped.

The music shifted. Someone started a carol in the square. The crowd thinned into clusters, people drifting toward the stage, toward the lights, toward whatever part of the night felt most like a story.

Wes glanced at the clock above the hall entrance and felt his fatigue settle into his bones like flour dust after a long day.

He set the ladle down and wiped his hands on his apron. “Okay,” Wes announced to no one. “Cocoa station is now self-serve.”

A volunteer gasped. “That’s anarchy!”

Wes pointed at a sign. “There are instructions.”

The volunteer squinted. “Wes, this says ‘DON’T MAKE ME REGRET THIS.’”

Wes nodded. “Correct.”

Sam’s low chuckle warmed the air.

Wes turned to him, pretending annoyance. “Don’t laugh. You’re about to be demoted.”

Sam lifted his brows. “Demoted to what.”

Wes gestured at the mugs. “You’re on dish duty.”

Sam nodded like that was normal. “Okay.”

Wes froze. “Wait. You’re just… going to do it.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Yes.”

Wes’s throat tightened, inconveniently. “You don’t have to.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “I want to.”

Wes swallowed hard and looked away like the snow outside was suddenly fascinating. “Fine,” he muttered. “But you’re doing it wrong.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Show me.”

Wes stared, then sighed. “You’re impossible.”

Sam started rinsing mugs at the back sink like he’d been doing it his whole life. Calm. Unbothered. Present.

Wes watched him for a beat too long, then busied himself wiping down the counter with way more intensity than necessary.

When the last mug was stacked, Sam dried his hands on a towel and glanced at Wes. “Ready.”

Wes blinked. “For what.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “To go home.”

Wes’s chest tightened.

Wes made a face. “I’m not a child.”

Sam nodded. “I know.”

Wes swallowed. “Then why are you… doing this.”

Sam didn’t flinch from the question. “Because it’s late. You’re tired. And I like walking with you.”

Wes’s breath caught at the last part.

Wes’s voice came out rough. “You can’t keep saying things like that.”

Sam’s eyes stayed steady. “You can keep telling me to stop. I won’t.”

Wes stared at him, pulse thudding, and realized Sam was doing something worse than flirting.

Sam was being consistent.

Wes grabbed his coat from behind the counter and shoved his arms into it like he was suiting up for battle. “Fine,” Wes muttered. “Walk me home. But if anyone sees us, I’m going to pretend you’re escorting me for… public safety.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Was that sarcastic.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “No.”

Wes huffed a laugh and headed for the side door.

Outside, the snow had softened into a fine drift, the air cold and clean. The square was still bright, music and laughter rolling through the night like a tide.

Wes and Sam moved along the edge of the crowd, not hiding exactly, but not advertising either. Wes kept his hands in his pockets. Sam kept his pace matched to Wes’s like it was instinct.

They passed the stage where Noel was speaking into a microphone with theatrical enthusiasm.

“Welcome to the Twelve Days of Tinsel Town!” Noel’s voice boomed. “If you are here tonight, you are now legally obligated to have fun!”

A cheer went up.

Wes muttered, “He’s going to get sued.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “He’ll enjoy it.”

Eben stood beside the stage with his clipboard, gaze scanning the crowd like a man preparing for a riot he expected to win.

Wes watched Noel talk and felt a sudden, quiet pang.

Noel looked happy. Not perfect. Not rested. But happy.

Wes thought of himself in his apartment last night, sitting for the first time in hours because someone had told him to and made it feel like care instead of criticism.

Wes swallowed.

Sam’s voice came low. “What.”

Wes blinked. “What.”

Sam’s gaze held him. “You went quiet.”

Wes shrugged, too fast. “I’m normal.”

Sam didn’t buy it. “Wes.”

Wes stopped walking.

Sam stopped too, turning slightly so he was facing Wes, blocking the wind again without making it a big deal.

Wes’s throat tightened. “This is not a great place for… feelings.”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “Then keep it small.”

Wes stared at him. “You’re too good at this.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I’m good at staying calm. You’re good at running yourself into the ground.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Rude.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “True.”

Wes exhaled, then said the thing he’d been trying not to say all evening.

“It’s easier,” Wes admitted quietly, “when you’re around.”

Sam’s expression softened in a way that made Wes’s ribs feel too tight. “Okay.”

Wes blinked. “That’s all you have.”

Sam took a slow step closer, careful, voice low. “It’s not all I have,” Sam said. “It’s all I’m going to say right now. Because you asked for slow.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He swallowed. “Right.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “But I heard you.”

Wes stared at him, cheeks warm, eyes stinging in the most irritating way. He nodded once, because nodding was safer than anything else.

Sam’s hand lifted, hovering between them like a question.

“May I,” Sam asked softly.

Wes’s pulse skittered. He nodded. “Yeah.”

Sam’s fingers brushed Wes’s sleeve near the wrist, just a light touch, grounding. Not possessive. Not demanding. Just there.

Wes breathed out slowly. “Okay.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Okay.”

They started walking again.

By the time they reached Candle & Crumb, the bakery windows glowed softly, warm in the snow like a promise.

Wes unlocked the door and hesitated, hand on the knob.

He didn’t invite Sam in.

He also didn’t say goodbye.

Wes stood there for a beat, caught between habit and want.

Sam didn’t push. He just waited, patient as ever.

Wes swallowed, voice rough. “Do you want to… come up. For a minute.”

Sam’s gaze softened, but his voice stayed careful. “For a minute.”

Wes nodded fast. “A minute.”

Sam stepped inside.

Wes locked the door behind them, heart pounding like he’d just committed a crime.

They climbed the stairs in silence, the kind that wasn’t empty. It was full of everything neither of them was saying.

At Wes’s apartment door, Wes fumbled the key once, cursed under his breath, and finally got it open.

Warmth spilled out.

Wes stepped aside, letting Sam in. Sam looked around like last night, taking in the small space, the evidence of Wes’s life.

Then Sam’s gaze returned to Wes, steady.

Wes’s throat tightened. “So,” Wes said, uselessly. “Minute.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Minute.”

Wes hovered near the kitchen counter, hands in his pockets like he didn’t know what to do with them.

Sam took off his coat, folding it neatly and setting it on the chair like it mattered. He moved with the calm competence of a man who could make even a cramped apartment feel ordered.

Wes watched him and felt something inside him ache.

Sam stepped closer.

He didn’t touch Wes. He just stopped within reach and looked at him like Wes was the only thing in the room.

Wes’s breath caught.

Sam’s voice was low. “You did good tonight.”

Wes flinched like the praise was too bright. “Stop.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “No.”

Wes swallowed hard, eyes stinging. “You’re going to make me… expect things.”

Sam’s voice softened. “Okay.”

Wes blinked. “Why do you keep saying okay like that.”

Sam’s expression softened, serious now. “Because you’re telling me what you’re afraid of,” Sam said. “And I’m not going to punish you for it.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He looked away fast, jaw clenched.

Sam’s hand lifted slowly, hovering. “May I.”

Wes nodded, barely.

Sam’s fingers touched Wes’s cheek, light as a promise. Sam’s thumb stroked once, gentle.

Wes’s breath shuddered out.

Sam leaned in and kissed him, slow and soft, the kind of kiss that didn’t demand anything except presence.

Wes melted into it, hands fisting in Sam’s sweater like he needed something solid.

Sam pulled back just enough to murmur, “Still okay.”

Wes’s voice came out wrecked. “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Good.”

Wes let out a shaky laugh that sounded like surrender. “I hate that word now.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I’ll try a different one.”

Wes blinked. “Like what.”

Sam’s voice went quiet and steady. “Safe.”

Wes froze.

His eyes stung harder.

Sam’s thumb stroked once. “You feel safe.”

Wes swallowed, chest tight. “Yeah,” Wes whispered. “I do.”

Sam held his gaze, steady and calm.

Then Sam stepped back, just a fraction, giving Wes space like he always did.

“Minute’s almost up,” Sam said softly.

Wes stared at him, heart pounding.

He should’ve let Sam go. He should’ve ended it clean, while it was still simple.

Instead, Wes did something reckless.

He reached out and caught Sam’s sleeve.

Sam stilled, gaze dropping to Wes’s hand, then lifting to Wes’s eyes.

Wes swallowed. “Stay. A little longer.”

Sam’s expression softened in a way that made Wes’s chest ache.

Sam’s voice was quiet. “Okay.”

Wes’s shoulders dropped like his body had been waiting for that permission all his life.

Outside, snow fell against the window in soft quiet taps.

Inside, Wes Candle let someone stay.

**[STOP WRITING]**



Sam didn’t move right away.

He just stood there with Wes’s hand on his sleeve, like he was letting the moment settle into place instead of rushing past it.

Wes’s fingers tightened, not hard, just enough to make the ask real.

Sam’s gaze held Wes’s for a long beat. Then Sam said again, quiet and steady, “Okay.”

Wes’s shoulders dropped like someone had finally loosened a strap he’d been carrying too tight for too long.

Wes let out a shaky breath and immediately tried to ruin the tenderness with sarcasm. “This is not a sleepover.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Then what is it.”

Wes blinked, caught.

Wes looked away, jaw tight. “It’s… a minute,” he muttered. “A longer minute.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes huffed a laugh, half embarrassed. “Stop saying okay like it fixes everything.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “It doesn’t fix everything.”

Wes glanced back, surprised by the honesty.

Sam continued, low and steady. “It just tells you I’m here.”

Wes’s throat tightened again. He nodded once, because nodding was still safer than saying what he actually felt.

Wes dropped his hand from Sam’s sleeve and stepped back, gesturing vaguely at the apartment like it was an apology for existing. “You can… sit,” Wes said. “If you want.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to the couch, then to Wes. “Do you want me to sit.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Yes.”

Sam nodded once and moved to the couch, sitting in a way that didn’t sprawl, didn’t dominate the space, didn’t act like he owned anything. Just calm, grounded presence.

Wes hovered by the kitchen counter, hands shoved into his hoodie pocket, looking like a man waiting to be graded.

Sam watched him for a beat. “Come here.”

Wes froze. “Excuse me.”

Sam’s voice stayed gentle. “Come sit. You don’t have to stand like you’re about to bolt.”

Wes opened his mouth to argue, then realized Sam was right, and hatefully, Wes’s body wanted to obey.

Wes muttered, “I can sit.”

Sam lifted a brow.

Wes sighed, defeated by his own patterns, and crossed the room to sit on the far end of the couch like the cushion might accuse him of emotional vulnerability.

Sam didn’t comment on the distance. He didn’t tease. He just sat there, steady and quiet.

For a minute, neither of them spoke.

The apartment hummed with warmth. The heater clicked on and off. Snow tapped softly against the window.

Wes stared at his own hands, then blurted, “So what happens now.”

Sam’s gaze stayed on him. “Now we sit.”

Wes blinked. “That’s… not what I meant.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “What did you mean.”

Wes swallowed hard. “Like. Us.” He made a vague gesture between them like he could physically shape the answer into something manageable. “This.”

Sam didn’t flinch. “We keep it slow.”

Wes exhaled. “Okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed at the word. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes weakly. “Don’t.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You started it.”

Wes huffed a laugh and leaned back, staring at the ceiling like it might offer guidance.

Then Wes said, quieter, “I don’t do this.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “What.”

Wes swallowed. “Letting people in.”

Sam nodded once like he’d already known that. “I noticed.”

Wes’s cheeks heated. “Don’t say it like it’s obvious.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “It is obvious. But not in a bad way. In a… learned way.”

Wes stared at him, something in his chest aching at the gentleness.

Wes tried to redirect. “You’re very good at talking like you’ve been to therapy.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I have.”

Wes blinked. “You have?”

Sam nodded. “Yeah.”

Wes stared, caught off guard in the most inconvenient way. “You… seem like you don’t need it.”

Sam’s expression didn’t change much, but something in his eyes went quieter. “Everyone needs it sometimes.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Why did you go.”

Sam didn’t answer immediately. He glanced toward the window, then back to Wes.

“Job,” Sam said finally. “Things you see. Things you carry. You either talk about it or it eats you.”

Wes’s chest tightened. He didn’t know what to do with the softness that rose in him.

So he did the only thing he knew: he tried to be funny.

“Well,” Wes muttered, “I cope by baking and pretending I’m a self-sufficient pillar of strength.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “How’s that going.”

Wes snorted. “Badly.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I noticed.”

Wes groaned and rubbed his face. “You’re unbearable.”

Sam’s voice stayed low. “You asked me to stay.”

Wes peeked at him through his fingers. “That was a moment of weakness.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “Or strength.”

Wes dropped his hands, staring at Sam like Sam had just spoken a foreign language.

Wes swallowed. “Don’t make it poetic.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes sighed. “That one was sarcastic.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “A little.”

Wes leaned back again, trying to breathe normally. His heartbeat was still too loud.

After a beat, Wes said, carefully, “Are you… going to leave after this.”

Sam’s gaze stayed on him. “Do you want me to.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “No.”

Sam nodded once. “Then no.”

Wes blinked. “That’s… not how people work.”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “It’s how I work.”

Wes stared at him, and something in his chest cracked open just a fraction.

Wes whispered, almost angry at himself, “Why are you like this.”

Sam’s expression softened. “Because I want to be.”

Wes’s eyes stung.

Wes turned his head away fast. “I hate feelings.”

Sam didn’t laugh. He just said, quiet and kind, “Yeah. I know.”

The silence that followed wasn’t empty. It was full of everything Wes wasn’t saying.

Wes cleared his throat and stood abruptly, pacing two steps before he caught himself and froze, embarrassed.

Sam didn’t comment. He just watched, calm.

Wes gestured toward the kitchen like it was a distraction. “Do you want tea.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Do you want tea.”

Wes blinked, irritated. “Stop answering questions with questions.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I’m checking.”

Wes exhaled. “Yes. I want tea.”

Sam nodded. “Then yes.”

Wes’s mouth twitched despite himself. He turned to the kitchen and started filling the kettle, hands moving on autopilot.

Behind him, Sam’s voice was low. “You don’t have to perform.”

Wes’s shoulders tensed. “I’m not performing.”

Sam’s tone stayed even. “You are.”

Wes gripped the kettle handle too tight. “It’s how I keep things… from getting messy.”

Sam didn’t push. He just said, quiet, “Messy is allowed.”

Wes swallowed hard and flicked the kettle on.

The click sounded too loud.

Wes turned back, leaning against the counter with folded arms, trying to find a version of himself that didn’t feel like exposed wiring.

Sam was still on the couch, posture relaxed, gaze steady.

Wes stared at him for a beat too long.

Sam’s eyes softened. “Come here.”

Wes froze again. “You already said that.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “And you’re still hovering.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. He walked back to the couch and sat again, closer this time, like the movement had happened before he could overthink it.

Sam didn’t make a big deal of the closeness. He didn’t reach for Wes. He just sat there.

Wes stared at the space between their knees.

The kettle began to hiss softly in the kitchen.

Wes’s voice came out low. “That kiss today… outside.”

Sam’s gaze stayed on him. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “I didn’t hate it.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I noticed.”

Wes glared weakly. “Stop noticing.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes’s throat tightened and he looked away again like he could outmaneuver his own want.

Sam shifted slightly. Not away. Just… closer enough that Wes could feel the warmth of him.

Sam’s voice was quiet. “Do you want another.”

Wes’s breath caught.

Wes should’ve said no. He should’ve deflected. He should’ve done anything except be honest.

He whispered, “Yes.”

Sam didn’t move immediately. He waited, like he always did, giving Wes time to change his mind.

Wes didn’t.

Sam leaned in and kissed him, slow and soft, like a question Wes had already answered.

Wes’s hands rose on their own, fingers curling into Sam’s sweater at the shoulders. He pulled Sam closer with a quiet desperation he would absolutely deny later.

Sam’s hand settled at Wes’s waist, warm and steady, holding without gripping.

Wes let out a breath against Sam’s mouth that sounded suspiciously like relief.

Sam pulled back just enough to murmur, “Still okay.”

Wes’s voice was rough. “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Good.”

Wes made a small, helpless sound and hid his face against Sam’s shoulder for half a second like he needed a break from being seen.

Sam’s arm came around him gently, not trapping, not insisting. Just there.

Wes stayed still, breathing.

The kettle clicked off in the kitchen.

Wes didn’t move.

Sam didn’t move.

The world didn’t end.

After a beat, Sam said softly, “Tea.”

Wes exhaled, voice muffled against Sam’s shoulder. “Tea.”

Wes reluctantly pulled back and stood, moving to the kitchen like it was a rescue mission.

He poured water over the tea bag in Hugh’s tin, because of course Hugh had planned for this like a tiny glittery prophet.

Wes brought two mugs back to the couch and handed one to Sam, fingers brushing again.

Sam took it with a small nod. “Thanks.”

Wes sat back down and stared into the mug like it might tell him what to do with his life.

The tea smelled like cinnamon and chamomile and something soothing.

Wes took a sip.

It tasted like permission to stop.

Wes swallowed and said, quietly, “You’re going to wreck me.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “No.”

Wes blinked. “No?”

Sam’s voice was calm. “I’m going to be here. That’s not wrecking you.”

Wes stared at him, chest tight. “It feels like it.”

Sam’s expression softened. “Because you’re not used to it.”

Wes swallowed hard. “Yeah.”

Sam shifted slightly, shoulder brushing Wes’s again, deliberate and gentle. “We can keep it small.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes huffed a laugh, shaky but real. “This is ridiculous.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yeah.”

Wes glanced at him, then looked away fast, voice quieter. “I don’t want the whole town to know.”

Sam nodded once. “They don’t have to.”

Wes swallowed. “But Hugh will.”

Sam’s eyes warmed with amusement. “Hugh will try.”

Wes sighed. “I will kill him.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “No murders.”

Wes glared. “I’ll do a metaphorical murder.”

Sam nodded. “Acceptable.”

Wes leaned back, tea warm in his hands, and for the first time all day, his body stopped bracing.

Sam watched him for a long beat, then said, quietly, “You can sleep.”

Wes blinked. “I’m not sleeping. You’re here.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “That’s why you can.”

Wes swallowed, throat tight again. “You’re not staying the night.”

Sam’s expression didn’t change much. “Do you want me to.”

Wes’s breath caught.

Wes stared at his tea.

Wes whispered, “Yes.”

Sam didn’t rush. He didn’t pounce on it like a victory. He just nodded once, slow.

“Okay,” Sam said softly. “But we keep it simple.”

Wes’s chest ached. “Simple like… what.”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “I stay. We sleep. No pressure. No pretending. You wake up and I’m still here.”

Wes’s eyes stung so hard he almost laughed to cover it. “That’s not simple.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “It can be.”

Wes swallowed. “Okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes took another sip of tea and let his shoulders drop. He didn’t say thank you, because the word felt too small.

Instead, he leaned slightly toward Sam and let his head tip, just barely, toward Sam’s shoulder again.

Sam’s arm went around him, steady and warm.

Wes’s eyelids started to feel heavy, like his body had been waiting for safety to get permission to shut down.

Sam’s voice was low. “You did good today.”

Wes’s mouth twitched. “Stop.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “No.”

Wes exhaled a sleepy, annoyed sound that wasn’t really annoyed.

Outside, snow kept falling.

Inside, Wes Candle finally let himself rest.

**[STOP WRITING]**





Wes didn’t fall asleep all at once.

He drifted.

His body did that cautious thing it always did when it finally stopped moving: hovering at the edge of rest like it didn’t trust it. Like if he let go, something would break. Something would be missed.

But Sam’s arm was around him, steady and warm, and the apartment was quiet in a way that felt protected instead of empty.

Wes’s breath slowed.

Sam didn’t move much. Just enough to adjust the blanket when Wes’s shoulders twitched. Just enough to keep Wes from sliding into an awkward angle that would make his neck hate him tomorrow.

Wes muttered something incoherent into Sam’s shoulder.

Sam’s voice came low, calm. “Yeah. I’m here.”

Wes exhaled like his whole body had been holding that question for years.

The last thing Wes registered was Sam’s hand, gentle at the back of his neck, thumb stroking once like a grounding point.

Then Wes was gone.

---

Sam stayed still for a while after Wes fell asleep.

He watched Wes’s face soften, watched the tension drain out of his brow like it had finally been given permission. Watched the way Wes’s hands unclenched, fingers loosening around the mug like he no longer needed to be ready for impact.

Sam had seen a lot of tired.

But this was different. This was *earned* tired. The kind that came from carrying everyone else’s needs like they were a duty instead of a choice.

Sam’s jaw tightened slightly.

He adjusted the blanket again, then carefully eased Wes upright just enough to slide the mug from his hands without waking him. Wes made a small sound of protest, then settled again, head tipping back toward Sam’s shoulder like it belonged there.

Sam exhaled.

“Okay,” Sam murmured, more to himself than anything. “Bed.”

Getting Wes to bed without waking him fully was… a strategy exercise.

Sam moved slow, careful. One hand supporting Wes’s back, one under his arm, lifting like Wes was precious instead of stubborn.

Wes blinked once, groggy. “Don’t,” he mumbled.

Sam paused. “Don’t what.”

Wes’s eyes didn’t open properly. “Don’t leave.”

Sam’s chest went tight.

“I’m not leaving,” Sam said quietly.

Wes’s mouth twitched, like the answer landed somewhere deep. Then Wes slumped forward again, trusting Sam with the weight of him like it was nothing.

Sam guided him into the bedroom, sat him carefully on the edge of the bed, and peeled the hoodie off him with the slow patience of a man defusing a bomb.

Wes, half-asleep, muttered, “This is humiliating.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You’re fine.”

Wes’s head lolled. “Liar.”

Sam eased Wes back onto the mattress, pulled the blankets up, and paused when Wes’s hand shot out and caught his wrist.

Wes’s eyes cracked open, unfocused but intense. “Stay.”

Sam swallowed. “I’m staying.”

Wes blinked, then whispered, “Promise.”

Sam leaned in, voice low and steady. “I promise.”

Wes’s grip loosened.

Sam stayed there another beat, just watching Wes breathe, watching the lines of strain fade out of his face like someone had finally turned the volume down on his life.

Then Sam stood, turned off the bedside lamp, and moved back out to the living room.

He didn’t crawl into Wes’s bed. Not because he didn’t want to.

Because he’d said simple, and he meant it.

Sam stretched out on the couch, coat folded on the chair, boots lined neatly by the door like he belonged in a life that was calmer than his own.

The apartment creaked softly as it settled.

Outside, snow kept falling.

Inside, Sam Rook stayed.

---

Morning arrived quietly.

Grey light seeped through the curtains. The bakery below began its slow waking hum, pipes ticking, building shifting, the world remembering it had a schedule.

Wes woke once, disoriented, then remembered the weight of last night.

He lay still for a beat, staring at the ceiling, heart thudding.

He listened.

No sound from the bedroom except his own breathing.

He swallowed, chest tightening.

Then, from the living room, a soft noise: the rustle of fabric. The click of the kettle switch. A quiet footstep.

Wes’s breath let out like he’d been holding it in his sleep.

He rolled out of bed, hair a disaster, and padded toward the doorway.

Sam stood in the kitchen area in a plain black t-shirt, sleeves pushed up, quietly making tea like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Wes froze.

This was… domestic.

This was… dangerous.

Sam glanced up, immediately reading Wes’s face. “Morning.”

Wes stared. “You’re here.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I said I would be.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Yeah.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “You sleep okay.”

Wes’s mouth opened, and something honest almost came out.

Instead, Wes defaulted to sarcasm like it was a flotation device. “I drooled. If you tell anyone, I’ll burn the town down.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Noted.”

Wes drifted closer without meaning to, stopping near the counter like he belonged there. Like Sam belonged there.

Wes eyed the kettle. “You’re making tea.”

Sam nodded. “Hugh’s tin.”

Wes groaned. “Of course.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “It works.”

Wes muttered, “Hugh will be insufferable when he finds out his tea supported a romantic milestone.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to him, amused. “A milestone.”

Wes’s face warmed. “Don’t.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “You asked me to stay. I stayed.”

Wes stared at the counter, then at Sam’s hands, then at the mug Sam set down for him like Wes was expected.

Wes took it, fingers brushing Sam’s.

His pulse jumped, as if his body hadn’t gotten the memo that they weren’t in crisis anymore.

Wes cleared his throat. “So. Rules still apply.”

Sam nodded once. “Yes.”

Wes took a sip, then realized he was hungry in a quiet, normal way, not in a panic way. It was… new.

Wes blinked at the sensation like it was suspicious. “I’m hungry.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Good.”

Wes glared. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “That sounded fake again.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “It was.”

Wes huffed a laugh despite himself, then leaned back against the counter, tea warm in his hands, feeling his body slowly remember what it was like to exist without bracing.

Sam watched him for a beat. “You have to be at the bakery soon.”

Wes blinked. “Yeah.”

Sam’s tone stayed even. “Eat first.”

Wes rolled his eyes. “You’re all in a conspiracy.”

Sam’s brows lifted. “Who’s all.”

Wes gestured vaguely. “You. Noel. Eben. Hugh. Probably Harold Gibbons.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Harold definitely.”

Wes groaned and took another sip.

Then, because he apparently couldn’t help himself, Wes asked quietly, “Did I… make you uncomfortable. Sleeping here.”

Sam didn’t hesitate. “No.”

Wes swallowed. “You could’ve left.”

Sam’s gaze held his, steady as ever. “I didn’t want to.”

Wes’s chest tightened so sharply he almost flinched. He looked away fast, because he was still Wes, and receiving care was still a weird skill he hadn’t leveled up in.

The phone on the counter buzzed.

Wes glanced at it and groaned. “No.”

Sam looked at the screen. “Noel.”

Wes squinted. “How does he know you’re here.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “He doesn’t.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “He senses romance. Like a shark.”

Sam handed Wes the phone.

Wes answered with dread. “Noel.”

Noel’s voice burst through, bright and too awake. “WES. GOOD MORNING. ARE YOU ALIVE.”

Wes stared at the ceiling. “Barely.”

Noel didn’t pause. “Fantastic. Emergency but fun. Day One setpiece is moving up. We need Candle & Crumb’s cinnamon knots for the ‘First Light’ welcome table, and also, someone has put googly eyes on the inflatable snowman and Eben is threatening to commit a lawful execution.”

Wes pinched the bridge of his nose. “It’s 7:12 a.m.”

Noel’s voice was delighted. “Correct! The town is thriving!”

Wes sighed. “I’ll bring knots.”

Noel lowered his voice dramatically. “Also. Hugh is acting like he knows something. Do you know something.”

Wes’s face went hot.

Wes glanced at Sam, who watched him with quiet amusement and a patience that felt unfair.

Wes snapped, “Noel.”

Noel went instantly serious in that Noel way that meant he cared. “Wes.”

Wes swallowed. “I’m fine.”

Noel’s voice softened. “Okay.”

Wes blinked.

Noel added, gentler, “But you don’t have to be fine alone.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He glanced at Sam again.

Wes exhaled. “I’ll see you soon.”

Noel brightened back up like he’d been waiting for permission. “Great! Bring knots! Save Christmas! Love you bye!”

The call ended.

Wes stared at the phone in his hand like it had personally attacked him.

Sam’s voice was low. “Cinnamon knots.”

Wes muttered, “I’m going to drown in dough.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’ll walk you down.”

Wes blinked. “You don’t have to.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “I want to.”

Wes’s chest tightened again, annoying and warm.

Wes took one more sip of tea, then set the mug down carefully like he was handling something fragile.

He looked at Sam, then away, then back again.

Wes’s voice came out quiet. “Thank you. For staying.”

Sam’s expression softened, real and steady. “You’re welcome.”

Wes swallowed hard, then grabbed his apron like it was armor. “Fine,” Wes muttered. “Let’s go feed the town and prevent Eben from executing a snowman.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Sounds like a plan.”

Wes headed for the stairs, and Sam followed.

Not behind him like a guard.

Beside him like he belonged.

**[STOP WRITING]**



Wes discovered, immediately, that walking down the stairs beside Sam felt… illegal.

Not because it was scandalous. Because it was *simple.* Like it belonged in a life Wes hadn’t let himself imagine.

He tried to ruin it with attitude.

“You don’t have to escort me,” Wes muttered as they descended. “I’m not a fragile antique.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to him, warm. “You’re fragile in different ways.”

Wes’s foot missed a step by half an inch.

He caught himself, glare sharpening. “That was rude.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “True.”

Wes huffed, then pushed open the bakery door.

Candle & Crumb greeted him the way it always did: warmth, the faint hum of old ovens, the smell of yeast like a promise that something good was going to rise if Wes didn’t sabotage it.

Wes stepped in, shoulders squaring automatically, competence clicking into place like a switch.

Then he realized Sam was still there.

Standing in the doorway, watching the bakery like it was a sacred space and a potential crime scene at the same time.

Wes’s throat tightened, stupidly. “You can… come in.”

Sam did, calm and quiet.

Wes went straight to the prep counter, pulling out flour and sugar and butter with the speed of a man trying to outrun his own feelings. “Cinnamon knots,” he muttered. “Fine. Great. Lovely. I’ll just casually produce joy for an entire town before breakfast.”

Sam leaned lightly against the counter edge, hands relaxed, eyes tracking Wes’s movements. “You’re good at it.”

Wes snapped, “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes’s shoulders twitched with a laugh he tried to swallow. “You’re going to get punched with dough.”

Sam lifted his brows. “Threats.”

Wes glared. “Promises.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, and the tiny smile did something dangerous to Wes’s heart.

Wes turned away fast and started mixing, hands moving like they knew what to do even if Wes’s brain didn’t.

The dough came together under his palms. Smooth. Elastic. Alive.

Wes exhaled, grounding himself in the work. “Okay,” he muttered. “We do knots. We bake them. We save Christmas. We prevent Eben from executing an inflatable.”

Sam’s voice was low. “He would.”

Wes snorted. “He *wants* to.”

Sam watched Wes knead for a minute, then said quietly, “Do you want help.”

Wes blinked. “You can’t help. You’re a cop.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “I have hands.”

Wes’s face warmed. “Everyone has hands.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Let me use mine.”

Wes stared, caught on the phrasing, then hissed, “Not like that.”

Sam’s eyes warmed with amusement. “Like what.”

Wes pointed a floury hand at him. “Stop being calm. It’s suspicious.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Fake.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Yes.”

Wes exhaled and shoved a clean apron at Sam like it was a dare.

Sam took it without hesitation and tied it on with practiced ease that felt wildly unfair.

Wes stared. “Why do you know how to tie an apron.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I can cook.”

Wes’s eyes widened. “You’ve been hiding information.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “I’m full of surprises.”

Wes muttered, “I hate that that’s attractive.”

Sam’s eyes flicked to him. “What.”

Wes snapped, “Nothing. Start rolling dough.”

Sam moved in, calm and competent, hands sure as he took a portion and began shaping it. Not perfect like a baker. But good. Careful. Like he respected the work.

Wes watched for half a second too long, then forcibly returned to his own dough.

They worked in a quiet rhythm, flour dust drifting in the warm air like soft snow.

Wes didn’t realize how tense he’d been until his shoulders started to loosen without him having to fight for it.

Sam glanced at him. “Better.”

Wes’s mouth tightened. “Don’t narrate me.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes’s lips twitched. “That one sounded real.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “It was.”

Wes’s chest did that tight, warm thing again.

He focused hard on braiding.

---

By the time the first tray went into the oven, the bakery smelled like cinnamon and butter and the beginning of a good day.

Wes packed a box with finished knots, still warm, and slammed the lid shut like he was closing up his dignity too.

“Alright,” Wes said. “We go to Merryweather Hall. We deliver. We flee before Hugh weaponizes crafts.”

Sam picked up the box like it weighed nothing. “I’ll carry it.”

Wes blinked. “You don’t have to.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “I want to.”

Wes’s throat tightened again, because apparently that was his personality now.

They locked up and headed back into the snow.

Walking through town with Sam carrying a box of cinnamon knots felt… dangerously like a couple thing.

Wes tried to scowl at the world to compensate.

It didn’t help.

---

Merryweather Hall was already buzzing when they arrived.

Noel met them at the door like he’d been waiting with a stopwatch and a prayer. “YES,” Noel breathed, eyes on the box. “The knots.”

Wes held up a finger. “No touching until you promise not to cry on them.”

Noel placed a hand on his chest. “I will cry internally.”

Eben appeared behind Noel, gaze landing on the box, then on Sam in the apron.

Eben blinked once.

Slowly.

Like he was processing a system update.

Wes braced for the comment.

Eben’s voice was flat. “Rook.”

Sam nodded. “Frost.”

Eben’s gaze dropped to the apron again. “Apron.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Apron.”

Wes covered his mouth with his fist to hide the laugh.

Noel’s eyes darted between them, delighted. “Okay! Great! Cinnamon knots are secured. Everyone lives. Now. Emergency Two.”

Wes sighed. “The snowman.”

Noel pointed toward the stage with the tragic intensity of a man cursed to care. “Someone put googly eyes on it. Huge ones. It looks… intimate.”

Wes blinked. “Intimate.”

Noel nodded gravely. “It’s looking at people like it knows their secrets.”

Eben’s jaw tightened. “Remove them.”

Noel whispered, “Hugh.”

Wes groaned. “Of course it’s Hugh.”

As if summoned by accusation, Hugh bounded in from the side hallway with a roll of tape and glitter-free cardstock in his arms.

“Good morning!” Hugh announced, too loudly. “I sensed cultural stagnation and intervened.”

Eben’s gaze turned cold. “Everhart.”

Hugh paused mid-bounce, beaming. “Yes, Spreadsheet King.”

Eben’s eyes narrowed. “You altered municipal decor.”

Hugh lifted his chin. “I improved it.”

Eben’s voice stayed calm, terrifyingly. “Remove the eyes.”

Hugh clutched the tape roll. “But it makes him expressive.”

Wes cut in, voice sharp. “Hugh. Those eyes are the size of saucers.”

Hugh nodded. “Correct. It’s called *impact.*”

Wes pointed toward the stage. “Take them off. Now. Before Eben arrests the snowman.”

Noel whispered to Wes, “He would.”

Wes whispered back, “I know.”

Sam, quietly, stepped in beside Wes. His presence shifted the energy like a hand on the volume knob.

Sam’s voice was calm. “Hugh.”

Hugh looked at Sam like he’d just spotted a celebrity. “Officer Rook. My hero.”

Sam didn’t smile, but his eyes warmed. “Remove the eyes.”

Hugh pouted. “Everyone hates art.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Remove. Them.”

Hugh stared for a beat, then sighed dramatically. “Fine. I’ll downgrade him to… tasteful.”

Eben nodded once, satisfied, as Hugh stomped off toward the stage muttering about oppression and vision.

Noel exhaled. “Thank you.”

Wes glanced at Sam, low. “You’re terrifying.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Only when necessary.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed, because apparently the universe wanted him embarrassed at all times. “Right.”

Noel clapped his hands again, trying to herd momentum. “Okay! First Light welcome table needs knots, cocoa needs refills, and the parade staging is in ten. Wes, you’re on table display. Sam, can you help with crowd flow. Eben, please don’t kill anyone.”

Eben’s voice was flat. “No promises.”

Noel pointed. “Eben!”

Eben blinked slowly. “I will attempt restraint.”

Noel looked relieved like that was the best he’d ever get. “Perfect.”

Wes grabbed the box and started arranging knots at the welcome table with frantic precision. He made them look beautiful, because of course he did. Because if he couldn’t control his feelings, he could at least control pastry aesthetics.

Sam moved through the hall with quiet authority, guiding volunteers, repositioning stanchions, redirecting traffic like a human tide control system.

Wes kept catching glimpses of him. The way he spoke. The way people listened. The way he checked corners without looking like he was checking corners.

Wes’s chest felt too full.

Hugh returned from the stage, triumphant. “Tasteful eyes applied,” he announced.

Noel squinted. “Those are still big.”

Hugh sniffed. “They’re *moderately* big.”

Eben’s gaze narrowed. “Acceptable.”

Noel whispered to Wes, “He said acceptable. He’s basically euphoric.”

Wes snorted.

Then the front doors opened, and the first wave of visitors swept into Merryweather Hall, rosy-cheeked and excited, kids dragging parents toward the cocoa station, couples huddling in scarves, townsfolk greeting each other like the festival was a reunion.

Wes straightened, smile going on like armor.

“Welcome,” Wes said, bright and practiced. “Cinnamon knots are here. Your joy is mandatory.”

A woman laughed. “Wes Candle, you’re a treasure.”

Wes forced a grin. “I’m a carbohydrate dealer.”

Sam’s gaze flicked over, warm, like he liked watching Wes in his element.

Wes immediately looked away and busied himself refilling a tray.

Because being seen like that felt like standing in sunlight with no hat.

---

The morning blurred into motion.

Knot trays emptied. Cocoa refilled. Noel darted like a pinned Christmas ornament. Eben stalked the perimeter like a winter storm disguised as a man.

At one point, a toddler tried to climb the stage stairs, and Sam calmly scooped him up and handed him back to a grateful parent without missing a beat.

Wes watched it happen and felt his heart do something ridiculous.

He wasn’t even sure what it was.

He just knew it was building.

When the crowd finally eased, Wes leaned back against the table and exhaled.

Sam appeared beside him like he’d been waiting for the exact moment Wes’s knees might wobble.

Sam’s voice was low. “You okay.”

Wes stared at him. “Stop asking that in public.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Answer anyway.”

Wes swallowed. The truth rose up like it had been waiting.

“I’m tired,” Wes admitted quietly. “But… not the bad kind.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Good.”

Wes glared automatically. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes’s mouth twitched. “You’re going to get me smiling in front of civilians.”

Sam’s voice went lower, close enough to make Wes’s skin prickle. “Later,” Sam murmured, like he was stacking promises again.

Wes’s pulse jumped. “You love that word.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “I love what it means.”

Wes’s breath caught.

He looked away fast, because he was still learning how to exist when someone spoke to him like he mattered.

A scream erupted from the stage area.

Wes flinched. “What now.”

Noel’s voice rang out, horrified: “THE SNOWMAN HAS LOST AN EYE.”

Eben’s voice followed, flat and lethal: “Everhart.”

Hugh’s voice yelled back, offended: “IT FELL OFF ON ITS OWN. THAT’S CALLED REALISM.”

Wes closed his eyes. “I’m going to bed.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “After breakfast.”

Wes opened one eye, deadpan. “It’s noon.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Still.”

Wes exhaled a laugh he couldn’t stop, and Sam watched him like the laugh was the point.

Wes’s voice came out quiet, surprised at himself. “I’m glad you’re here.”

Sam didn’t gloat. Didn’t tease. Just nodded, steady.

“I’m glad too,” Sam said softly.

And for one dangerous second, in the middle of Merryweather Hall’s chaos, Wes believed him.

**[STOP WRITING]**



Noel’s scream had the raw, operatic force of a man witnessing the collapse of civilization.

Wes opened both eyes and pushed off the table with a sigh. “I swear to God, if I have to do emergency triage on an inflatable snowman, I’m moving to the woods.”

Sam’s gaze flicked over him, amused. “You’d still end up on a committee.”

Wes muttered, “I hate that you’re right.”

They cut through the hall toward the stage area, weaving around stragglers and half-collapsed garland piles. The snowman loomed near the stage steps, cheerful and massive and now lopsided in a way that made him look… emotionally compromised.

One googly eye remained. The other had vanished.

Hugh Everhart stood beneath it, hands on hips, jaw set like he was a misunderstood artist in a courtroom.

Eben Frost stood opposite him with the expression of a man considering whether inflatable decor could be tried for war crimes.

Noel hovered between them, visibly vibrating. “It was PERFECT,” Noel hissed. “And now it’s… it’s giving *cursed.*”

“It fell off!” Hugh protested. “On its own! That’s physics!”

Eben’s voice was quiet and lethal. “You attached it with tape.”

Hugh lifted a finger. “Yes. And tape is a temporary adhesive. Which means this is not my fault. This is the tape’s fault.”

Eben didn’t blink. “The tape did not choose this.”

Wes arrived beside Noel and looked up at the snowman. “Okay,” Wes said, voice flat. “Where’s the eye.”

Hugh pointed at the floor dramatically. “It bounced. Rolled. Disappeared.”

Noel whispered, “It’s gone to haunt the children.”

Wes crouched and scanned the stage edge, then looked at the crowd nearby.

A little kid stood holding the missing googly eye like it was treasure.

The kid’s mother looked mortified. “I’m so sorry,” she said. “He found it and said it was ‘the snowman’s soul.’”

Noel made a strangled sound. “It *is.*”

Wes stood and smiled at the kid. “Hey, buddy,” Wes said gently. “Can you give the snowman his soul back.”

The kid considered Wes like Wes had asked him to surrender a crown. Then he nodded solemnly and held it out.

Wes accepted the eye with both hands like it was sacred. “Thank you. You saved Christmas.”

The kid beamed.

Noel exhaled like he’d survived a near-death experience. “Okay. Okay. Crisis resolved.”

Eben extended a hand. “Tape.”

Hugh recoiled. “No. Not you. You’ll tape it on with spite.”

Eben’s gaze narrowed. “Correct.”

Sam stepped in quietly, palm open. “Give me the tape.”

Hugh blinked, offended. “Why you.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Because you’ll accept it, and Eben won’t explode.”

Hugh hesitated, then handed Sam the roll like he was conceding to diplomacy.

Sam crouched, retaped the eye with clinical efficiency, pressed it in place, and gave the snowman a small, firm pat like he was closing a case.

“Done,” Sam said.

Noel clasped his hands under his chin. “He’s whole again.”

Eben nodded once, satisfied, and walked away like he’d been deprived of a righteous execution.

Hugh watched him go and muttered, “That man is a frostbite in pants.”

Wes muttered back, “That is literally his name.”

Hugh gasped. “I’m a genius.”

Noel turned on Wes with sudden intensity. “Okay. Next thing. Day One is stabilized. Day Two is tomorrow. And Day Two is…”

Wes’s eyes narrowed. “Noel.”

Noel’s grin turned feral. “The Mistletoe Mixer.”

Wes closed his eyes. “No.”

Noel grabbed his clipboard like he was about to commit a crime. “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze slid to Wes, amused.

Wes stared at Noel. “That is a recipe for public humiliation.”

Noel’s eyes sparkled. “That is the point.”

Wes whispered, “I hate you.”

Noel whispered back, “You love me.”

Eben’s voice drifted from across the room, flat: “He does.”

Wes snapped, “TRAITORS.”

Noel patted Wes’s shoulder. “Relax. It’s just a mixer. People mingle. They’re tasteful. They kiss their spouses on the cheek. They pretend they’re not dying inside. It’s fine.”

Wes stared. “You are describing my personal hell.”

Noel leaned closer, eyes bright with mischief and something gentler underneath. “Also, it’s a fundraiser. And it’s cute. And the town expects you to make festive pastries shaped like tiny bows.”

Wes’s resolve cracked at the word *pastries.*

Wes grimaced. “Fine. I’ll make bows.”

Noel smiled triumphantly. “Amazing. Now I’m going to say something and you can’t stop me.”

Wes tensed. “Noel.”

Noel’s gaze flicked to Sam, then back to Wes, and his voice went a little softer. “If you don’t want attention, we’ll keep it low-key.”

Wes blinked.

Noel shrugged like it was nothing. “I’m chaos, not cruel.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He nodded once, the only kind of gratitude he could tolerate.

Noel brightened again immediately. “Great! Now I need you to take the welcome table for another hour while I go stop Hugh from crafting propaganda.”

Hugh called from behind them, offended: “I HEARD THAT.”

Noel yelled back, “GOOD.”

Noel disappeared into the crowd like a festive hurricane.

Wes stood there for a beat, watching him go, then let out a slow breath.

Sam stayed beside him, quiet.

Wes glanced at Sam. “You’re smiling.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Noel is… intense.”

Wes muttered, “That’s one word.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I like him.”

Wes stared. “Why.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “He cares.”

Wes’s chest tightened again, because apparently everything was going to make him emotional today.

Wes looked away. “Yeah.”

Sam’s gaze held him for a beat. “You care too.”

Wes scoffed weakly. “Don’t start.”

Sam didn’t push. He just said softly, “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes, but it didn’t have bite.

They drifted back toward the welcome table. The crowd had thinned again, the morning rush settling into a steady festive hum.

Wes rearranged the cinnamon knots like he was building order out of sugar.

Sam hovered nearby, scanning the room, occasionally intercepting small kid-chaos with gentle efficiency.

A woman approached the table and smiled warmly at Wes. “These are beautiful,” she said, taking a knot. “You’re always such a steady presence at this festival.”

Wes forced his practiced smile. “Someone has to stop Noel from ascending into pure holiday energy.”

She laughed, then glanced at Sam. “And you,” she said to Sam, playful, “I didn’t know you did… baking.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to Wes, checking.

Wes’s throat tightened.

The woman continued, teasing but kind: “You two make quite the team.”

Wes’s face warmed. He opened his mouth to deflect.

Sam beat him to it, voice calm. “He’s doing the work,” Sam said, nodding toward Wes. “I’m just helping.”

Wes blinked.

It was perfect. True. Modest. And it didn’t invite more questions.

The woman smiled, satisfied, and wandered off with her knot.

Wes exhaled, relieved.

Sam leaned in slightly, low enough for only Wes. “You okay.”

Wes shot him a look. “Stop asking me that in public.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Answer anyway.”

Wes swallowed, then said quietly, “I’m okay.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Good.”

Wes muttered, “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes’s mouth twitched, half a smile.

After a beat, Wes said, almost against his will, “Thank you.”

Sam’s eyes stayed steady. “For what.”

Wes glanced at the crowd, then back. “For… not making it a thing.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “You asked for private.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “Yeah.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “I heard you.”

Wes swallowed hard and looked away, because he didn’t know what to do with the feeling of being listened to.

---

By mid-afternoon, the hall started to empty. Families drifted home. Volunteers slumped into chairs. Noel finally sat down and stared into the void for ten full seconds.

Eben appeared at Noel’s shoulder and quietly set a bottle of water in front of him like a offering.

Noel blinked at it. “Are you… caring.”

Eben’s voice was flat. “Hydrate.”

Noel stared for a beat, then whispered, delighted, “He loves me.”

Eben didn’t react. But his ear went faintly pink.

Wes caught it, and for once, the sight of someone else being quietly, awkwardly cared for didn’t make him want to run.

It made him feel… less alone.

Sam found Wes near the coat rack, folding tablecloths with grim determination.

Sam’s voice was low. “You’re done.”

Wes didn’t look up. “I’m never done.”

Sam stepped closer. “Wes.”

Wes stopped moving.

Sam’s tone stayed calm. “We’re leaving.”

Wes exhaled. “Bossy.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes finally looked up, and his defenses tried to rally. Then he saw Sam’s eyes, steady and warm, and the defenses just… sighed.

Wes nodded once. “Okay.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Okay.”

Wes grabbed his coat, then hesitated. “Do we… walk.”

Sam nodded. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “Quietly.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Quietly.”

They slipped out into the snow, the town glowing soft behind them.

Wes walked beside Sam, hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched against the cold.

After two blocks, Wes said quietly, “Tomorrow is the Mistletoe Mixer.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to him. “I heard.”

Wes grimaced. “Noel is going to set traps.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Probably.”

Wes muttered, “Hugh will craft propaganda.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Definitely.”

Wes exhaled, then said the thing he was trying not to say. “If there’s… mistletoe.”

Sam didn’t tease. He just waited.

Wes swallowed. “Don’t make me perform.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “I won’t.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “Promise.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “I promise.”

Wes nodded once, and the tension in his shoulders loosened.

They walked in silence for a while, snow crunching under their boots, streetlights turning the world into a quiet glittering tunnel.

Then Sam’s voice came low. “Later.”

Wes’s pulse jumped. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes huffed a laugh despite himself, because apparently his body had decided this was safe enough to be happy in.

They reached Candle & Crumb.

Wes unlocked the door and paused.

This time, he didn’t call it a minute.

He just stepped aside.

Sam followed him in.

And the bakery door clicked shut behind them like a promise kept.

**[STOP WRITING]**



The bakery after hours always felt like a different world.

No crowd. No music. No Noel shouting “joy is mandatory” like he could legally enforce happiness. Just the soft hum of refrigeration, the settling creak of old wood, and the lingering smell of cinnamon that clung to everything like a gentle curse.

Wes locked the front door, slid the bolt into place, and leaned his forehead against the glass for one long second.

Sam stood a few feet behind him, quiet, patient, letting Wes decompress without narrating it.

Wes exhaled. “Okay.”

Sam’s voice was low. “Okay.”

Wes didn’t even glare this time. He just turned, shrugged out of his coat, and hung it on the hook with the ritual care of a man who needed small control to keep his brain from sprinting.

Sam followed suit, folding his coat neatly, like he was allergic to mess.

Wes watched him do it and muttered, “You’re unsettling.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Because I fold things.”

“Yes,” Wes said firmly. “It’s suspiciously functional.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “You’re surrounded by sugar chaos all day. Let me have one thing.”

Wes’s mouth twitched. “Fine.”

They stood in the quiet for a beat, then Wes moved behind the counter and started wiping down surfaces that didn’t need wiping, because apparently his hands only knew how to exist when they were doing.

Sam stepped closer, calm. “Wes.”

Wes didn’t look up. “If you tell me to eat, I’m filing a complaint.”

Sam’s voice stayed even. “Sit.”

Wes froze.

He looked up slowly, like Sam had just spoken profanity in a holy place. “Excuse me.”

Sam nodded toward the stool behind the counter. “Sit. Five minutes.”

Wes blinked. “Why.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Because you’ve been moving since yesterday.”

Wes opened his mouth to argue.

Then he realized he didn’t want to argue. Not really. Not with that look.

Wes muttered, “Bossy.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Yes.”

Wes sighed, defeated, and sat on the stool like it was a personal compromise with the universe.

Sam stepped closer, leaning against the counter across from him. Not crowding. Just there.

For a minute, they listened to the bakery breathe.

Wes’s shoulders dropped a fraction.

Sam’s voice came low. “You did good.”

Wes rolled his eyes automatically, but the reaction had less bite. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes huffed a laugh, then stared at the floor, quieter. “It didn’t feel like good.”

Sam’s expression softened. “It doesn’t have to feel good to be good.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He swallowed. “That’s… annoying.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “True.”

Wes stared at him, and the quiet steadiness of Sam’s presence pressed against all the places Wes usually kept locked.

Wes looked away fast. “Tomorrow is the Mistletoe Mixer.”

Sam’s gaze didn’t waver. “Yeah.”

Wes’s jaw tightened. “It’s going to be… a thing.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “It doesn’t have to be.”

Wes exhaled through his nose. “Noel will make it one.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “We plan around Noel.”

Wes blinked. “We.”

Sam didn’t flinch. “We.”

Wes’s chest went tight and warm, an infuriating combo.

Wes tried to regain control with sarcasm. “Okay, Officer. What’s the plan.”

Sam’s gaze softened, serious. “You tell me what you want. I follow it.”

Wes stared.

That shouldn’t have hit as hard as it did.

Wes swallowed. “I want… slow.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay.”

Wes’s voice got quieter. “And private.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Okay.”

Wes hesitated, then forced the hardest piece out. “And if the town starts sniffing around, I want you to… not joke about it.”

Sam’s expression softened. “I won’t.”

Wes blinked. “Promise.”

Sam’s voice was calm and certain. “I promise.”

Wes exhaled, and it came out shaky despite his best efforts.

Sam watched him for a beat, then said quietly, “You can also say you don’t want to go.”

Wes’s eyes widened. “I have to go.”

Sam’s brow lifted. “Do you.”

Wes’s mouth opened, then closed.

Because no, he didn’t *have* to. He just… always did. He always filled the gaps. Always kept the machine running.

Wes’s voice came out rough. “If I don’t show up, Noel will try to do everything himself.”

Sam nodded once, like he understood the math of it. “Then we go. We keep it simple. You do what you need to do. I’m there. No games.”

Wes stared at him. “You’re going to be there.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “If you want me there.”

Wes swallowed. “I… yeah. I do.”

Sam didn’t smile like he’d won. He just nodded, steady, like Wes had given him a job he intended to keep.

“Okay,” Sam said softly.

Wes’s mouth twitched despite himself. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes’s laugh came out quiet and helpless.

Then the silence returned, softer now.

Wes looked at Sam, then down, then back again, like he was still getting used to the idea that asking didn’t automatically mean losing.

Wes cleared his throat. “You want… tea.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Do you want tea.”

Wes sighed. “Yes. I want tea.”

Sam nodded. “Then yes.”

Wes shook his head like he couldn’t believe this was his life, and hopped off the stool.

He moved to the little back prep area and put the kettle on, the ritual familiar enough to keep him grounded. He pulled out Hugh’s tin again, because apparently Hugh had become an invasive species in Wes’s home ecosystem.

Wes muttered, “I can’t believe I’m drinking Hugh’s feelings tea.”

Sam’s voice drifted from behind him, amused. “It works.”

Wes poured two mugs and carried them back to the counter, setting one down for Sam.

Their fingers brushed.

Wes’s breath caught, stupidly.

Sam didn’t move away. He just looked at Wes, steady.

Wes’s voice came out quiet. “Do you ever… get tired of being the calm one.”

Sam took the mug, gaze still on Wes. “Sometimes.”

Wes blinked. “What do you do.”

Sam’s expression softened. “I find a place that feels safe.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “And that’s… here.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Yeah.”

Wes stared at him for a long beat, then looked away fast because his eyes were doing that irritating stingy thing again.

Wes lifted his mug and took a sip so he’d have an excuse not to talk.

The tea tasted like cinnamon and permission.

Wes swallowed, then said, very quietly, “I’m not good at this.”

Sam’s voice was gentle. “You don’t have to be good. You just have to be honest.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “I am being honest.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I know.”

Wes set the mug down carefully, like his hands needed a job. Then he leaned forward on the counter, gaze on the wood grain, and whispered, “I keep waiting for the part where you change your mind.”

Sam didn’t answer with a joke. He stepped closer instead, slow and careful, until Wes could feel his warmth across the counter.

Sam’s voice was low. “Look at me.”

Wes hesitated, then lifted his eyes.

Sam’s gaze was steady, open. “I won’t change my mind without telling you,” Sam said. “And I’m not looking for an exit.”

Wes’s throat tightened painfully. “Why.”

Sam’s expression softened. “Because I like you,” he said simply. “And because you matter.”

Wes’s breath hitched.

He hated how much that landed. Hated how his whole body responded like it had been starving for those words.

Wes’s voice came out rough. “If you say stuff like that, I’m going to do something stupid.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, barely. “Like what.”

Wes swallowed hard. “Like trust you.”

Sam’s gaze warmed, serious. “Okay.”

Wes blinked. “Stop saying okay like it’s a spell.”

Sam’s voice stayed soft. “It’s not a spell. It’s consent.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed.

Then, because Wes was apparently determined to test every boundary he had, he stepped out from behind the counter and into Sam’s space.

He didn’t announce it. Didn’t perform it. He just moved closer until their bodies were almost touching.

Wes’s voice went quiet. “Do you want to stay upstairs again.”

Sam’s eyes held his. “Do you want me to.”

Wes swallowed. “Yes.”

Sam nodded once, slow. “Okay.”

Wes exhaled, and it came out like relief.

Sam lifted a hand, hovering, waiting.

Wes nodded, giving permission he was still learning to give.

Sam’s fingers brushed Wes’s cheek, gentle. Warm.

Wes leaned into it before he could stop himself.

Sam kissed him, slow and soft, not hungry, not demanding. Just steady.

Wes’s hands fisted lightly in Sam’s shirt like he needed something solid to hold onto while his brain tried to sprint away.

Sam pulled back just enough to murmur, “Still okay.”

Wes’s voice was wrecked. “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Good.”

Wes closed his eyes for a beat, forehead tipping forward until it rested against Sam’s.

He whispered, barely audible, “Stay.”

Sam’s voice was quiet and absolute. “I’m staying.”

They turned off the bakery lights together.

Then Wes led Sam upstairs, one step at a time, slow like he’d asked for, heart thudding like it finally believed the promise.

And this time, when they reached Wes’s door, Wes didn’t call it a minute.

He just opened it and let Sam in.

**[STOP WRITING]**


Wes’s apartment felt different when Sam walked in like he belonged.

Not like he owned it. Not like he was claiming it. Just… like he didn’t need to be convinced the space could hold him.

Wes shut the door behind them and stood there for a second, hand still on the knob, like he was waiting for the part where he panicked and ruined it.

Sam didn’t rush him. Sam just took off his coat, folded it neatly (because of course he did), and set it on the chair like it was normal to be here.

Wes stared at the coat. “You fold things like you’re auditioning to be a husband.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I fold things like I don’t want wrinkles.”

Wes scoffed. “Suspicious.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You’re stalling.”

Wes blinked. “I am not.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “You are.”

Wes exhaled through his nose, caught. “Fine.”

He walked into the living room, paused, then sat on the couch like it was safer than standing. Like if he sat, he couldn’t accidentally sprint away from his own feelings.

Sam followed and sat beside him, leaving space. Not too much. Not too little.

Wes stared at his hands. “I don’t know what to do with this,” he admitted, voice low.

Sam’s voice was calm. “We don’t have to do anything.”

Wes blinked. “That sounds fake.”

Sam shook his head slightly. “It’s not.”

Wes swallowed. “Then… what are we doing.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Being here.”

Wes’s chest tightened, because of course it did.

He tried to make it a joke. “So you’re breaking and entering into my emotional ecosystem.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You invited me.”

Wes muttered, “That was a lapse in judgment.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Or a choice.”

Wes stared at him, then looked away fast, cheeks hot.

The silence held for a minute, but it wasn’t awkward. It was… careful. Like both of them were handling something fragile without pretending it wasn’t fragile.

Wes cleared his throat. “Tomorrow,” he said, because planning was safer than feelings. “Mistletoe Mixer.”

Sam nodded once. “Yeah.”

Wes grimaced. “Noel is going to try to orchestrate romance like it’s a parade float.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Probably.”

Wes’s mouth tightened. “And if Hugh puts mistletoe over the cocoa station, I’m committing crimes.”

Sam’s tone stayed even. “I’ll stop you.”

Wes glanced at him. “You’re supposed to be on my side.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I am. I’m also on the side of ‘no crimes.’”

Wes huffed, then rubbed his face. “Okay. Tomorrow. We keep it simple.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Tell me what simple looks like.”

Wes took a breath. “Simple looks like… we do our jobs. We don’t get cornered. We don’t get forced into a performance.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes added, quieter, “And if we do get cornered…”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Then we leave.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Yeah.”

Sam’s voice went softer. “And if you want, we can set a signal.”

Wes blinked. “A signal.”

Sam nodded. “Something you say when you’re overwhelmed. I get you out.”

Wes’s chest went tight in that warm, aching way that made him want to throw something and also cry.

Wes swallowed. “That’s… a lot.”

Sam didn’t flinch. “It’s simple.”

Wes stared at him. “You’re going to ruin me with competence.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Sorry.”

Wes blinked. “Was that real.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Yes.”

Wes exhaled a laugh he didn’t mean to have.

He leaned back against the couch, shoulders dropping. His body was still learning what it felt like to be tired without being afraid.

Wes stared at the ceiling. “So… you’re staying.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “If you want me to.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “I do.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay.”

Wes’s mouth twitched. “Stop saying okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes turned his head to look at him, and the way Sam looked back made Wes’s stomach flip.

Not hungry. Not frantic. Just… steady want.

Wes swallowed hard. “Can I…,” he started, then stopped, because asking was still new and terrifying.

Sam’s voice stayed gentle. “Can you what.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Can I have another kiss.”

Sam didn’t tease him. Didn’t pounce. Just nodded slowly, like Wes had asked for a glass of water.

“Yeah,” Sam said softly. “You can.”

Wes leaned in first this time, because if he didn’t, he’d overthink it into dust.

The kiss was slow. Warm. Unhurried. The kind of kiss that didn’t escalate unless both people wanted it to.

Wes’s hand slid to Sam’s shoulder, fingers curling there. Sam’s hand settled at Wes’s waist, grounding.

Wes exhaled against Sam’s mouth like his body had been holding its breath for years.

Sam pulled back just enough to murmur, “Still okay.”

Wes’s voice came out rough. “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Good.”

Wes made a small, helpless sound and rested his forehead against Sam’s for a beat.

Then Wes leaned back, blinking like he’d just survived something.

Wes muttered, “This is… dangerous.”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “We keep it slow.”

Wes nodded. “Slow.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “Do you want me to sleep on the couch again.”

Wes’s chest tightened. He hesitated. Then forced the truth out. “I want you close,” Wes admitted quietly. “But I don’t want… pressure.”

Sam nodded immediately. “No pressure.”

Wes swallowed. “So… bed. But simple.”

Sam’s gaze held his, calm. “Okay. Bed. Simple.”

Wes’s throat tightened again. “Promise.”

Sam’s voice was quiet and absolute. “I promise.”

Wes stood, offering Sam a hand like it was a treaty.

Sam took it, warm fingers closing around Wes’s.

Wes’s pulse jumped, because apparently holding hands was now something that could destroy him.

They moved to the bedroom together, slow, no rushing, no performance. Wes changed into sweatpants and an old t-shirt without looking at Sam too much, because being watched still made him feel exposed.

Sam changed too, calm and unbothered, like bodies were just bodies and this didn’t have to be a test.

Wes slid under the covers and stared at the ceiling like it was going to grade him.

Sam climbed in beside him, leaving space again.

Wes turned his head slightly. “Closer,” he said, voice barely above a whisper.

Sam shifted closer, careful, and Wes felt the warmth of him at his side.

Wes’s breath shuddered out.

Sam’s voice was low. “This okay.”

Wes nodded. “Yeah.”

Sam’s arm came around Wes gently, not pinning, not claiming. Just holding.

Wes’s body softened like it had been waiting for that exact shape.

Wes whispered into the dark, “If you leave tomorrow without telling me, I’ll pretend I’m fine and then I’ll implode.”

Sam’s voice didn’t wobble. “I won’t.”

Wes swallowed. “Okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed in the dark, like he could hear the relief in the word. “Okay.”

Wes huffed a small laugh, then yawned, exhaustion finally catching him now that he’d stopped fighting it.

Sam’s voice went softer. “Sleep.”

Wes muttered, “You’re bossy.”

Sam’s mouth tipped against Wes’s hair. “Yes.”

Wes’s eyes closed.

And because the world is occasionally merciful, it stayed quiet.

---

Wes woke up to light filtering in through the curtains and the steady warmth of Sam’s arm still around him.

No empty apartment. No panic. No sudden drop.

Wes lay still for a beat, then whispered, barely, “You’re still here.”

Sam’s voice was rough with sleep. “Yeah.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “Good.”

Sam’s arm tightened gently for half a second, like an answer.

Wes blinked, then remembered the calendar like it was a threat.

“Today is Day Two,” Wes muttered.

Sam’s eyes opened slowly. “Mistletoe.”

Wes grimaced. “Mistletoe.”

Sam’s gaze slid to Wes. “We do the signal.”

Wes exhaled. “Right. Signal.”

Sam waited.

Wes thought for a second, then muttered, “If I say ‘I need more cinnamon,’ you get me out.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Understood.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “And if you say it.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Then you get me out.”

Wes blinked. “You’d need out.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “I’m not immune to chaos.”

Wes huffed a laugh. “Fair.”

Sam shifted slightly, eyes on Wes. “Before we go… do you want a kiss.”

Wes’s stomach flipped. He tried to look unimpressed and failed. “Yes.”

Sam kissed him, soft and brief, like a promise with good manners.

Sam pulled back. “Still okay.”

Wes breathed, “Yes.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Good.”

Wes groaned quietly. “I’m never going to survive you.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “We’ll see.”

Wes lay there for a beat longer, warm and held, and thought, with a kind of startled clarity:

This might be what safe feels like.

And he might be ready to want it.

**[STOP WRITING]**


Wes made it exactly four minutes after getting out of bed before his brain tried to sabotage him.

He stood at the sink, splashing water on his face, staring at his reflection like it was an enemy combatant.

“You are fine,” Wes told himself.

His reflection looked unconvinced. His hair was doing something criminal. His eyes were softer than they had any right to be. There was a faint crease at his mouth like he’d forgotten how to *not* smile.

Behind him, Sam moved through the tiny apartment with quiet efficiency, pulling on a sweater, checking his phone, folding a blanket on the couch like it had personally offended him overnight.

Wes watched him in the mirror and felt his chest tighten again.

Stupid.

Wes cleared his throat. “We’re going to get caught.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “Maybe.”

Wes turned, annoyed. “That’s not reassuring.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You asked for honest.”

Wes glared. “I asked for slow.”

Sam nodded. “And private. We can do both.”

Wes exhaled. “How.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “We don’t linger in doorways. We don’t stand under mistletoe. If Hugh approaches, we pivot.”

Wes blinked. “Pivot.”

Sam nodded like this was normal. “Pivot.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “You have a plan for Hugh.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Always have a plan for Hugh.”

Wes rubbed his face. “Okay. Fine. We go. We do Day Two. We survive Noel. We evade mistletoe traps.”

Sam’s voice was low. “And if you need out.”

Wes swallowed. “Cinnamon.”

Sam nodded once. “More cinnamon.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Don’t say it like that.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Like what.”

Wes pointed at him. “Like it’s a code word that turns you on.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “It’s a code word that gets you safe.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He looked away fast. “Right.”

Sam watched him for a beat, then said softly, “You ready.”

Wes grabbed his coat like it was armor. “No.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Same.”

Wes stared. “You just said you’re calm.”

Sam shrugged. “I can be calm and still not enjoy mixers.”

Wes huffed a laugh, relieved. “Okay. Good.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “Yeah.”

They headed downstairs and out into the cold.

---

Merryweather Hall looked… suspicious.

It was too decorated.

Too curated.

Too aggressively romantic for a town that usually reserved this level of intention for bake sales and passive-aggressive charity auctions.

Wes stopped at the front steps and stared.

There were ribbons everywhere. Candle clusters. A sign that read:

**MISTLETOE MIXER: FIND YOUR SPARK**

Wes’s soul tried to leave his body.

Noel swept out of the doors like a festive mastermind, eyes bright, cheeks flushed, scarf immaculate.

“WELCOME,” Noel announced. “TO LOVE.”

Wes hissed, “Noel.”

Noel beamed harder. “Wes!”

Wes pointed at the sign. “What is this.”

Noel clasped his hands. “This is community.”

Wes stared. “This is entrapment.”

Noel leaned in, delighted whisper. “This is fundraising.”

Wes’s resolve weakened immediately. “How much.”

Noel held up two fingers. “We raised two thousand already and the doors aren’t even open.”

Wes’s mouth tightened, begrudging. “Fine. But I’m not participating.”

Noel’s eyes widened with theatrical innocence. “Participating in what.”

Wes pointed upward.

Noel followed his finger, then gasped like he’d discovered oxygen. Hanging above the entryway, right in the center, was a lush mistletoe bundle the size of a small animal.

Noel smiled sweetly. “Isn’t it cute.”

Wes’s voice went flat. “No.”

Noel’s grin turned feral. “It’s *adorable.*”

Sam stepped forward slightly, calm presence cutting through Wes’s rising panic like a steady hand on the volume knob.

Sam’s voice was even. “We’ll enter through the side.”

Noel blinked. “There’s a side entrance?”

Eben’s voice drifted from inside, flat as law: “There is always a side entrance.”

Eben appeared in the doorway like a winter omen, clipboard in hand, gaze sweeping the steps with practiced displeasure.

Noel turned, offended. “Eben, don’t undermine my romance architecture.”

Eben didn’t blink. “It is a fire hazard.”

Noel clutched his chest. “It is a *love* hazard.”

Eben’s gaze slid to Wes and Sam, then away. “Side entrance. Now. Before you’re noticed.”

Wes stared at Eben. “Are you… helping.”

Eben’s voice was flat. “Crowd control.”

Noel whispered, starry-eyed, “He loves me.”

Eben didn’t react. “Move.”

Wes exhaled a laugh, half disbelief, half relief.

Sam guided Wes down the steps and around the building, away from the main entrance and the giant mistletoe ambush.

Wes muttered, “I can’t believe Eben is saving me from a shrub.”

Sam’s voice was low. “He’s saving the event from an incident.”

Wes glanced at him. “You mean me punching Noel.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes huffed. “Fair.”

They slipped in through the side door.

Inside, Merryweather Hall was transformed: soft lights, garlands draped like intentional art, tables set with little cards that said things like **“Share a favorite holiday memory”** and **“What’s your idea of a perfect winter night?”**

Wes stared at the cards like they were weapons.

“This is a psychological attack,” he whispered.

Sam’s eyes warmed. “You’ll survive.”

Wes muttered, “I hate this.”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “I know.”

That “I know” landed like care, not dismissal.

Wes swallowed and nodded once.

---

The doors opened.

The town poured in.

Not a riot, thankfully. More like a swarm of cheerful predators.

Couples arrived holding hands. Singles arrived with determination. Everyone arrived with the energy of people who had decided this was their chance to be festive and maybe get kissed.

Wes immediately got put to work at the pastry table, because Noel had correctly assumed that giving Wes a task was the only way to stop him from evaporating.

Wes arranged cookies shaped like bows and stars, trays of cinnamon knots, small pastries dusted with sugar like snow.

A woman leaned in, smiling. “Wes Candle, you’re spoiling us.”

Wes forced his professional grin. “It’s a sickness.”

Sam moved through the crowd near the edges, quiet and steady, keeping pathways clear, redirecting enthusiastic drifters, gently stopping a man from placing a chair directly in front of an emergency exit.

Wes kept catching glimpses of him.

Sam’s calm felt like a rope tied around Wes’s waist.

Not to restrain him. To keep him from drifting out to sea.

Noel drifted by, radiant, wearing a blazer that made him look like a Christmas-themed prince. He gave Wes a thumbs up and whispered, “You’re doing great.”

Wes hissed, “No mistletoe near me.”

Noel whispered back, delighted, “No promises.”

Wes glared.

Noel laughed and vanished into the crowd.

---

An hour in, the mixer was doing what mixers did.

People laughed too loudly. Sipped too much. Played the icebreaker games like their dignity was optional.

Wes was surviving, mostly by staying behind the pastry table like it was a fortress.

Then Hugh Everhart appeared.

Hugh wore a sweater that had a reindeer on it with sequins. The reindeer looked like it was judging everyone.

Hugh clasped his hands. “Wes.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Hugh.”

Hugh leaned in, stage-whispering. “How is your romantic concealment going.”

Wes’s jaw tightened. “I will end you.”

Hugh sighed blissfully. “Threats. Passion. Delicious.”

Wes pointed a cookie at him. “Do not.”

Hugh’s eyes flicked over Wes’s shoulder, and Hugh’s whole face lit up like a child spotting a parade.

Sam had just crossed the room, calm and focused, scanning the crowd.

Hugh whispered, horrified and thrilled, “He’s here.”

Wes hissed, “Quiet.”

Hugh clutched his scarf dramatically. “I can’t be quiet. I’m an artist.”

Wes’s voice went flat. “You’re a menace.”

Hugh gasped. “I’m a *cupid.*”

Wes leaned forward, low and lethal. “If you try to push mistletoe onto me, I will staple your sweater to the wall.”

Hugh looked offended. “Violence is not festive.”

Wes’s smile was sweet and terrifying. “It is if I do it with ribbon.”

Hugh blinked, then nodded slowly. “Okay. Fine. I will not meddle.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Promise.”

Hugh held up two fingers. “I promise. On my craft supplies.”

Wes didn’t trust him at all.

Hugh brightened immediately. “But I will observe.”

Wes sighed. “Of course you will.”

Hugh drifted away, humming like he’d been given a mission.

Wes exhaled, shoulders tight.

Sam appeared beside the pastry table like he’d sensed the shift.

Sam’s voice was low. “You okay.”

Wes glared. “Stop asking in public.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Answer anyway.”

Wes swallowed. “I’m… managing.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Good.”

Wes muttered, “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes’s lips twitched, traitor smile threatening.

Then, like the universe wanted to test his stability, a woman approached the table with bright eyes and a glass of punch.

She leaned in toward Wes, smiling. “Hi,” she said. “I’m Lila. I just moved back to town. And I have to say, you’re very cute.”

Wes froze.

His brain short-circuited, trying to find the correct polite response that didn’t include *I’m currently spiraling about a cop who makes tea and says okay like it’s consent.*

Wes managed, “Uh. Thanks.”

Lila laughed, undeterred. “So. Do you have a partner, or are you just… the town’s unofficial holiday husband.”

Wes’s throat tightened.

He felt Sam’s gaze on him, steady, giving him space.

Wes swallowed.

“I have…” Wes started, then stalled, the word *partner* catching in his throat like it was too big and too new.

Lila’s smile softened, curious, not cruel. “You have…?”

Wes’s chest tightened, panic rising.

And because he was apparently not completely self-destructive anymore, Wes did the thing he’d agreed to do.

He looked at Sam.

Wes said, quietly but clearly, “I need more cinnamon.”

Sam moved instantly.

Not dramatic. Not possessive. Just calm, decisive support.

Sam stepped in beside Wes and addressed Lila with a polite nod. “Sorry,” Sam said evenly. “We need him for the kitchen.”

Lila blinked, then smiled, good-natured. “Oh! Of course. Sorry.”

“No problem,” Sam said, calm.

Wes didn’t breathe again until Sam guided him away from the table, through a side corridor, toward the back prep area.

Wes’s heart hammered like he’d been chased.

Sam didn’t speak until they were out of earshot.

Then Sam’s voice was low. “You okay.”

Wes leaned back against the wall, eyes squeezed shut, chest heaving. “I hate that I’m like this.”

Sam didn’t flinch. “You’re overwhelmed. That’s not a crime.”

Wes’s laugh came out shaky and bitter. “Feels like it.”

Sam stepped closer, careful. “Do you want to leave.”

Wes’s chest tightened.

He thought of Noel. The fundraiser. The town. The duties he always carried.

Then he thought of the way his stomach had dropped when Lila asked that question, and how his brain had tried to jump out a window.

Wes swallowed. “Not yet.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay.”

Wes opened his eyes, glare half-hearted. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes exhaled, shaky, then whispered, “I couldn’t say it.”

Sam’s expression softened, immediate understanding. “I know.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “I didn’t want to lie. But I couldn’t…”

Sam’s voice was calm. “You don’t have to name anything you’re not ready to name.”

Wes stared at him, chest aching.

Sam’s gaze held his, steady. “You did the signal. You asked for help. That’s the win.”

Wes swallowed hard.

He nodded once. “Okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes let out a laugh that sounded like relief and embarrassment had collided.

Then Wes looked at Sam, and the hallway felt too quiet, too close, like the moment was hovering.

Wes’s voice went small. “Can I… have a minute.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “With me, or alone.”

Wes hesitated, then forced the truth out. “With you.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes’s shoulders dropped.

He stepped closer, slow, like he was practicing bravery instead of sprinting away from it.

Wes’s voice was barely a whisper. “Just… hold me.”

Sam’s face softened, and he moved in, wrapping his arms around Wes gently, steady warmth.

Wes exhaled into Sam’s shoulder like his whole body had been waiting for permission to stop fighting.

Sam’s voice was low near Wes’s ear. “I’ve got you.”

Wes’s eyes stung.

He muttered into Sam’s sweater, “If Hugh sees this, I’m moving to the woods.”

Sam’s mouth tipped against Wes’s hair. “He won’t.”

From down the hall, a voice called, delighted and distant: “WES? SAM? ARE YOU HIDING IN A ROMANTIC HALLWAY.”

Wes froze.

Sam didn’t.

Sam’s voice, calm and even, carried back: “No.”

Hugh’s voice floated closer. “THAT SOUNDED LIKE A LIE.”

Wes groaned into Sam’s shoulder. “He’s a bloodhound.”

Sam’s arms tightened gently for half a second. “We can leave.”

Wes inhaled, then exhaled. He straightened, still close, still warm.

Wes muttered, “No. We go back. We survive. But if Noel tries to trap me under mistletoe, I’m setting the garland on fire.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Noted.”

Wes pointed. “That was not permission.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I know.”

Wes swallowed, then nodded once, bracing himself.

Sam stepped back, giving Wes space, gaze steady. “Ready.”

Wes exhaled. “Ready.”

They headed back toward the crowd together.

Slow.

Simple.

And, against Wes’s expectations, not alone.

**[STOP WRITING]**


Depends what you mean by **“left”**, but in *this* context (cozy Christmas MM erotic romance + low-stakes vibe), “how far left” usually = **how far you can push intensity without breaking the cozy contract**.

Here’s the practical boundary line:

### The cozy contract

You can go **very** spicy, **as long as the emotional experience stays safe**.

**Cozy readers will forgive:**

* High heat, explicit language (within your platform limits)
* Flirty public tension
* A secret relationship
* A little embarrassment, *if it’s affectionate*

**Cozy readers will bounce if you go too far into:**

* Cruelty, humiliation, or “punishment” vibes
* High angst / betrayal / long cold-shoulder stretches
* Public outing, blackmail, or “town turns on them”
* Trauma dumps that change the genre into hurt/comfort mid-stream

### The “left edge” for your current scene

You’re writing **low-stakes + private + slow**. So the farthest you should push *today* is:

* **Public:** almost no visible couple behavior. Keep it “teamwork” to outsiders.
* **Private:** tender + grounding intimacy, lots of check-ins, *zero* coercion, and any escalation is initiated clearly (Wes asking, Sam confirming).
* **Conflict:** external (Noel/Hugh/mistletoe chaos), not relational sabotage.

### A simple dial you can use

If you want a clean W2M rule:

* **80% comfort / 20% tension**
* If a scene feels like it’s becoming 50/50, you’ve wandered out of cozy and into angst.

### “How far left” options you can choose

Pick one lane and stay consistent for the season:

1. **Cozy-Spicy (safest sell)**

   * Explicit private scenes, low angst, quick repair, strong aftercare energy.

2. **Cozy-Sweet (widest audience)**

   * Heat is present but shorter, more fade-to-black or “tasteful explicit,” focus on feelings.

3. **Spicy-Angsty (riskier for “cozy”)**

   * Deeper shame spiral, bigger third-act wobble, more emotional bruising.
   * Works, but you should brand it as **low-angst** or **comfort-heavy** carefully, or readers will complain.

If your goal is *cozy world + Christmas + low stakes*, you want **Lane 1**.

And no, you don’t need to “go further left” with drama to make it compelling. People will happily read 40,000 words about two idiots failing to walk under mistletoe while the town acts like a rom-com cult. Humans are simple creatures.


Yep, you’re on track. Annoyingly on track, actually.

### What you’ve nailed (cozy + Christmas + spicy)

* **Low-stakes external conflict:** tree logistics, snowman eye crisis, Noel/Hugh chaos. That’s cozy catnip.
* **Emotional safety stays intact:** Sam is steady, non-pushy, consent/check-ins are clear, Wes asks for what he needs. That’s exactly the cozy contract.
* **Private intimacy, public discretion:** you’re keeping their “us” mostly off-stage in public, which matches Wes’s boundaries and keeps the town from turning into a melodrama engine.
* **Rom-com setpieces:** tree arrival, festival hall, “mixer trap,” goofy side characters. This is a clean seasonal scaffolding.
* **Heat is “comfort-forward,” not punitive:** the spice is framed as grounding and wanted, not as a dominance flex that would shove you into darker territory.

### The only places you could drift off-track (easy fixes)

* **Check-ins are frequent enough that they risk feeling like a verbal tic.** Keep them, but vary the phrasing so it doesn’t read like a script:

  * Swap “Still okay?” sometimes for “Want me to stop?” / “More or less?” / “Tell me what you want.”
* **Wes’s avoidance loop is working, but don’t let it stall the romance momentum.** You’ve started solving that with the code word and Sam’s calm follow-through. Good. Next step is one small *positive* step from Wes that isn’t crisis-driven (eg. Wes initiates a handhold in a quiet moment).
* **The town attention needs to stay playful, not prying.** The Lila moment was perfect as a boundary test. Keep future “sniffing” moments brief and defused, not escalated into gossip warfare.
* **Make sure the “cozy” doesn’t become “only logistics.”** You’ve got a great external engine; now sprinkle more *romantic micro-moments* (shared laughter, small domestic acts, “I noticed you” moments) so the relationship feels like it’s growing, not just surviving.

### Quick scorecard

* **Genre promise:** ✅ Cozy holiday rom-com vibe
* **Romance trajectory:** ✅ slow burn progressing
* **Heat trajectory:** ✅ cozy-spicy (Lane 1)
* **Conflict level:** ✅ external, light, comedic
* **Risk of drifting into angst:** ⚠️ only if you add public outing / prolonged withdrawal / shame spiral without quick repair

If you keep the next beats as “Wes takes one brave step, Sam stays steady, the town keeps being ridiculous,” you’re exactly where you want to be.






You’re basically at the point in the book where the **rom-com engine is running**, the couple is **real**, and the story is about to stop *teasing* commitment and start *testing* it.

### Where we are on the timeline

* **Festival Day 1:** Tree crisis, crowd chaos, “teamwork chemistry,” private intimacy begins.
* **Overnight 1:** Sam stays. First real *domestic safety* moment.
* **Festival Day 2 (now):** **Mistletoe Mixer** = the first *public-pressure setpiece*. Wes gets boundary-tested (Lila), uses the **code word (“more cinnamon”)**, Sam extracts him cleanly, they reset, then head back in together.

So: **early Act 2**, roughly **25–35%** of a novella-length romance (give or take, depending how long you run the festival arc).

### What that means structurally

You’ve cleared:

* **Setup / promise of premise** (cozy Christmas town + chaos + Wes the overfunctioner + Sam the steady anchor)
* **Inciting connection** (Sam consistently showing up, not just flirting)
* **First threshold** (Wes letting Sam in: staying over, tea, waking up to him still there)

You’re now in:

* **“Testing the relationship under light stress” phase**
  The Mixer is a perfect test because it’s *not* danger-danger, it’s **social pressure** and **identity/labels pressure**, which is Wes’s actual boss fight.

### What’s next (the next 2–3 big beats)

To stay cozy and still escalate:

1. **Midpoint (the “we choose this” moment)**

   * Not a public declaration, but a **clear private choice** from Wes that isn’t panic-driven.
   * Example: Wes initiates contact in public *in a tiny, deniable way* (hand brush, standing closer, “this is my person” energy without words).

2. **Pinch / wobble (light, not angsty)**

   * Something threatens Wes’s control: Noel’s planning, Hugh’s near-exposure, a logistical emergency, or Wes overcommitting.
   * Key: **quick repair**, not a “cold for a chapter” thing.

3. **Endgame setup**

   * Wes learns he can ask for help *before* he breaks.
   * Sam proves he can stay without taking over.

If you want a one-line label: **We’re in the “first real test of boundaries + teamwork” section, right after the couple’s first solid foundation night.**

## Chapter 6: Back Into the Room

The hallway hug didn’t fix Wes’s wiring. It just stopped the sparks long enough for him to breathe.

Sam stepped back first, giving space like he always did. Wes hated how much he noticed that. Hated how much it helped.

“Ready,” Sam said, voice steady.

Wes swallowed. “Ready.”

They walked back toward the main hall together. Wes kept his chin up like he wasn’t five seconds away from faking his own death to avoid small talk.

The sound hit them first: laughter, music, the clink of glasses, Noel’s relentless optimism echoing off the walls like a threat.

Wes paused at the threshold.

Sam didn’t touch him. Just stood close enough that Wes could feel him there.

Wes exhaled. “If Hugh is waiting with mistletoe…”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “We pivot.”

Wes muttered, “Pivot.”

They stepped in.

Noel was on a small riser near the center of the room, holding a mic and smiling like a man who had never experienced shame.

“And now!” Noel announced. “Our next mixer activity: **The Mistletoe Minute!**”

Wes’s soul tried to exit through his shoes.

Noel continued, blissfully unaware of the violence he was provoking. “You will pair up with someone new, and you will answer a festive question, and if you happen to wander under the mistletoe…”

Wes turned toward the nearest exit with the calm of a man about to commit crimes.

Sam’s voice, low at his shoulder: “Side door. Now.”

They moved as one, slipping along the wall, blending into the flow of bodies. Sam timed it perfectly, waiting for a laugh spike, a swell of conversation, the moment the crowd shifted attention back toward Noel’s stage.

Wes couldn’t help it. He looked up.

The mistletoe had multiplied.

Noel had installed at least three new clusters. One near the cocoa station. One near the drink table. One directly over the main walkway like a holiday guillotine.

Wes’s jaw clenched. “He’s a menace.”

Sam’s gaze tracked the room. “He’s fundraising.”

Wes muttered, “He’s weaponizing botany.”

They reached a side corridor and paused. Wes pressed his fingertips to his forehead, trying to get his heartbeat to stop auditioning for a drumline.

Sam’s voice stayed quiet. “Do you want to leave.”

Wes inhaled. He thought of Noel’s fundraiser total. Of the kids in town who’d get winter coats because Noel couldn’t help turning everything into a spectacle.

Wes exhaled, disgusted with his own conscience. “Not yet.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay.”

Wes glared. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes made a sound that was half laugh, half surrender. “We can’t go back in there.”

Sam’s gaze steadied. “We can. You just don’t stand still.”

Wes blinked. “That’s your plan.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “It’s a good plan.”

Wes stared at him, then exhaled. “Fine. We go back. But we do not get trapped.”

Sam nodded. “Agreed.”

They re-entered the hall with purpose.

Wes marched straight to the pastry table like it was a bunker.

Sam positioned himself nearby, not hovering so closely that anyone would clock it, but close enough to intercept. A steady orbit.

Wes started rearranging cookies that absolutely did not need rearranging.

A woman approached with a smile. “Wes, these are incredible.”

Wes forced his polite face. “Thank you. Please take several so I feel validated.”

She laughed, then glanced past Wes. “And Officer Rook, aren’t you helpful tonight.”

Sam gave a small nod. “Just keeping things moving.”

The woman’s eyes twinkled. “You two are always where the action is.”

Wes’s spine stiffened.

Sam didn’t even blink. “He creates the action,” Sam said, voice even. “I prevent injuries.”

Wes’s stomach did an annoying little flip.

The woman laughed and wandered off, satisfied.

Wes breathed again.

He leaned toward Sam without fully turning his head. “Thank you.”

Sam’s voice was low. “For what.”

Wes muttered, “For being… normal.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “You asked for private.”

Wes swallowed. “Yeah.”

They held that quiet beat like a small pact, then the room shifted again as Noel launched into another announcement.

“And now,” Noel declared, “a toast!”

Wes’s eyes narrowed. “No.”

Noel’s gaze swept the room and landed with predatory accuracy on the pastry table.

Noel pointed. “WES CANDLE.”

Wes froze.

A hush fell like the town had been waiting for this moment all their lives.

Wes whispered through his teeth, “Noel.”

Noel smiled like a saint. “Please come up and tell us all why you love Tinsel Town.”

Wes stared at him with pure hatred.

Noel lifted the mic. “And if you don’t, I will do it for you, and I will cry.”

Wes’s jaw clenched.

Sam leaned in, low enough only Wes could hear. “You don’t have to.”

Wes swallowed. “If he does it for me, it’ll be worse.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “Want me to go with you.”

Wes blinked. That offer landed like a handrail in a stairwell he didn’t trust. “That would be… noticeable.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Then I stand near the stage. Not on it.”

Wes exhaled. “Fine.”

Wes stepped out from behind the table, shoulders squared like he was walking to his own execution.

He crossed the room as people smiled at him, warm and expectant, like he wasn’t a man being forced into public sincerity under the threat of Noel’s tears.

Sam moved too, not beside him, but angling toward the stage edge. Present. Quiet. A steady point in Wes’s peripheral vision.

Noel handed Wes the mic with the solemnity of a coronation. “Speak, Ye Baker of Our Hearts.”

Wes stared at the mic.

Then he looked out at the town. At the couples. At the singles. At the volunteers. At the ridiculous amount of mistletoe like it had won an election.

Wes cleared his throat.

“I love Tinsel Town,” Wes began, voice careful, “because it’s a place where no one minds if you’re… a little weird.”

The crowd chuckled warmly.

Wes continued, grudging honesty slipping through. “It’s a place where people show up. Even when it’s inconvenient. Even when it’s cold. Even when the inflatable snowman loses an eye and the entire community treats it like a national tragedy.”

Laughter broke out.

Wes glanced toward Sam without fully meaning to.

Sam was at the side of the stage, arms loosely crossed, gaze steady on Wes like he was the only person in the room.

Wes’s throat tightened.

Wes forced his eyes back to the crowd. “And,” Wes said, voice rougher now, “it’s a place where… you don’t have to do everything alone.”

The laughter softened into something quieter.

Noel’s face softened, genuinely.

Wes swallowed. “That’s… it. Please eat pastries. The cookies are safe. The mistletoe is not.”

The crowd laughed again, relieved.

Wes shoved the mic back into Noel’s hands like it was radioactive and stepped off the stage as fast as dignity allowed.

Noel leaned in as Wes passed. “That was beautiful.”

Wes hissed, “Do not.”

Noel whispered, delighted, “You almost had feelings.”

Wes whispered back, “I hate you.”

Noel sighed, blissed out. “Love you too.”

Wes reached Sam at the stage edge and immediately exhaled.

Sam’s voice was low. “You did good.”

Wes glared. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes’s mouth twitched, traitor smile showing up without permission. “Get me back to the pastry table before anyone talks to me.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay.”

They moved together, slipping back into their posts like nothing had happened.

But something had.

Wes had said it out loud. The theme he hated. The thing he never admitted.

And Sam had heard him.

---

## Chapter 7: The Wreath Auction

Noel, emboldened by success and powered by whatever madness lived in his bloodstream, announced the next fundraiser event twenty minutes later.

“Auction time!” Noel declared. “Wreaths, dates, and delightful experiences!”

Wes blinked. “Dates.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to him. “He means activities.”

Wes muttered, “Noel never means only activities.”

Noel paraded a volunteer-made wreath onto the riser like he was presenting an Olympic medal. “This lovely wreath comes with a prize package: two tickets to the Winter Lantern Walk, plus a cocoa flight and reserved seating at the carol concert!”

The crowd oohed. People waved bid cards.

Wes tried to make himself invisible behind the pastry table.

It did not work.

Noel’s gaze swept the room again and landed, inevitably, on Wes.

Noel’s smile turned angelic.

Wes whispered, “No.”

Noel lifted the mic. “And next!”

A volunteer dragged out a smaller wreath, this one decorated with tiny cinnamon sticks and dried orange slices.

Noel’s eyes shone with malicious joy. “This package includes… a private, after-hours bakery tour at Candle & Crumb, with fresh pastries and a holiday beverage of your choice.”

Wes froze so hard he almost cracked.

The crowd erupted into delighted laughter and applause.

Wes stared at Noel like he was witnessing betrayal.

Noel mouthed, *fundraising.*

Wes mouthed back, *murder.*

Bids shot up fast.

“Fifty!”

“Seventy-five!”

“One hundred!”

Wes’s head snapped toward Sam. “Make it stop.”

Sam’s expression stayed calm, but his eyes sharpened. “Do you want me to.”

Wes swallowed. “Yes.”

Sam didn’t hesitate.

He raised a bid card.

The crowd murmured, intrigued.

Noel blinked, then smiled like Christmas had personally kissed him on the forehead.

Sam’s voice carried, even and calm. “Two hundred.”

The room went quiet for half a beat.

Then someone laughed. “Officer Rook means business!”

A few more bids tried to climb. “Two-twenty!”

Sam didn’t blink. “Three hundred.”

That ended it.

The crowd whooped. Noel beamed like he was watching a romance movie unfold in real time.

Wes, behind the pastry table, felt his lungs stop working.

Noel banged the gavel with theatrical delight. “SOLD!”

The hall erupted into applause like they’d just witnessed a proposal.

Wes stared at Sam, horrified. “You just… bought me.”

Sam stepped closer, low enough only Wes could hear. “I bought a fundraiser package.”

Wes’s cheeks went hot. “That includes me.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Only if you want it to.”

Wes swallowed hard. He looked toward Noel, who was actively vibrating with glee.

Wes muttered, “Noel is going to combust.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Ignore him.”

Wes exhaled, shaky. “This is not private.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “We don’t have to do it tonight. We schedule it later. Quietly. After closing. No audience.”

Wes stared at him, heart pounding.

Sam continued, voice soft. “You wanted slow. This can be slow.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “You didn’t have to do that.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “I wanted to.”

Wes looked away, chest aching in that warm, infuriating way. “You’re reckless.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Maybe.”

Noel leaned over the riser like a gremlin. “Wes,” Noel called, delighted, “congratulations on being an *experience.*”

Wes snapped, “NOEL.”

Noel clutched his chest. “He said my name with feeling.”

Eben appeared beside Noel, gaze flat. “Focus.”

Noel whispered to Eben, “It’s happening.”

Eben’s mouth tightened. “I don’t care.”

Noel pointed at Eben’s face. “You care. Your ears are pink.”

Eben walked away.

Noel watched him go, then grinned at Wes like a menace. “Anyway! Next wreath!”

Wes leaned toward Sam, voice low. “We are never doing anything Noel suggests again.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Agreed.”

Wes blinked. “That was too easy.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I can agree with you.”

Wes muttered, “Suspicious.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Wes.”

Wes looked at him, still flustered.

Sam’s voice was low and steady. “We can leave.”

Wes inhaled. The urge to flee was strong. But he looked around at the room. People laughing. Noel glowing. The fundraiser total rising on the whiteboard.

Wes exhaled. “Not yet.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes glared weakly. “Stop saying okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes huffed a laugh, then muttered, “Fine. But if anyone corners me again, I’m deploying cinnamon.”

Sam’s voice was soft. “I’ll be ready.”

---

## Chapter 8: A Small Step That Isn’t a Crisis

The mixer wound down slowly, like the town didn’t want to let go of the feeling.

People drifted toward the exits in clusters. Volunteers began gathering empty cups. Noel stood near the front, beaming, tallying donations like he’d just won a war.

Wes kept busy, cleaning the pastry table with grim determination, because cleaning was safer than thinking about what Sam had bid.

Sam hovered nearby, helping fold tablecloths and stack chairs like he’d always been part of this machine.

Finally, Noel approached, softer now that the crowd had thinned.

He held up a clipboard. “We did good tonight.”

Wes didn’t look up. “You endangered my nervous system.”

Noel smiled, gentler. “And we raised enough to fund the winter coat drive and the community pantry through January.”

Wes’s hands paused.

He exhaled. “Fine. You can live.”

Noel’s grin widened. “Thank you.”

Noel’s eyes flicked, brief and careful, toward Sam, then back to Wes. “And,” Noel added softly, “thank you for trusting people tonight. Even a little.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He shrugged like it didn’t matter. “It was… necessary.”

Noel’s smile stayed kind. “Sure.”

Noel stepped away, leaving Wes with his thoughts, which was rude.

Sam moved in closer, voice low. “You ready to go.”

Wes nodded. “Yeah.”

They headed out together, slipping into the cold.

Outside, the town was quiet, the lights still glowing, snow falling in soft lazy drifts like the world was trying to be gentle.

Wes walked beside Sam in silence for a while, hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched against the cold.

Then Wes said, roughly, “About the auction.”

Sam didn’t pretend not to know. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “I don’t want… attention.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “I know.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “But I also…”

He trailed off. Because naming the want still felt like stepping off a ledge.

Sam didn’t push. He just waited.

Wes exhaled. “I want to do it,” Wes admitted quietly. “The bakery thing. Later. Just… us.”

Sam’s gaze softened, warm. “Okay.”

Wes glanced at him, annoyed. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes’s mouth twitched, the almost-smile slipping through again. “You’re unbearable.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Yeah.”

They reached Candle & Crumb.

Wes unlocked the door, then paused on the threshold, the old habit rising: keep it clean, keep it contained, keep it private.

Then, without fully thinking, Wes did something small.

He reached out and hooked one finger around Sam’s sleeve.

Not a dramatic gesture. Not a handhold. Just a tiny tether.

Sam looked down, then back at Wes, expression soft and steady.

Wes’s voice was low, almost embarrassed by his own bravery. “Come in.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes and pulled him inside anyway.

The door clicked shut.

The bakery’s warmth wrapped around them.

And for once, the step Wes took toward Sam wasn’t because he was panicking.

It was because he wanted to.

**[STOP WRITING]**




## Chapter 9: The After-Hours Tour

Candle & Crumb at night felt like a secret.

The street outside was quiet, the snow muffling everything until the town sounded far away. Inside, the bakery glowed with leftover warmth from the ovens, and the air held that soft, sweet breath of cinnamon and butter like it had absorbed Wes’s entire personality.

Wes locked the door behind Sam and leaned against it for half a second, eyes shut.

Sam didn’t comment. He didn’t rush. He just stood close, patient in a way Wes still didn’t know what to do with.

Wes opened his eyes and cleared his throat. “So. The bakery tour.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “The fundraiser package.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Don’t call it that.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes sighed like that word was going to kill him one day. “It’s… just us. No audience. No Noel.”

Sam nodded once, steady. “Just us.”

Wes swallowed, then gestured vaguely at the space. “Fine. Tour starts here. This is the front counter where the town comes to emotionally dump while buying carbs.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to the counter, then back to Wes. “And you listen.”

Wes scoffed. “I tolerate.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “You care.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Shut up.”

Sam didn’t. He just followed as Wes moved behind the counter, the protective barrier of it making Wes feel braver.

Wes pointed toward the display case. “This is where I keep the things that make people forgive each other.”

Sam leaned in slightly, examining the empty shelves. “Do they work.”

Wes’s mouth tightened. “More than they should.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “You’re good at this.”

Wes rolled his eyes, but the defensiveness didn’t fully stick. “Tour continues. Back prep.”

He led Sam through the swinging door.

The prep area was neat in the way Wes needed it to be. Flour canisters lined up. Tools hung in precise order. A steel table wiped clean enough to reflect a faint ghost of the overhead light.

Sam looked around slowly, taking it in without poking. Without touching. Respectful.

Wes’s chest tightened, annoyingly grateful.

Wes pointed at the mixer. “This machine is louder than Hugh and less dramatic.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “High bar.”

Wes moved to the oven, resting a hand on the handle like he was greeting an old friend. “And this,” Wes said, quieter, “is where I put my problems until they become edible.”

Sam’s gaze held him. “You ever put yourself in there.”

Wes blinked. “Excuse me.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “You put everyone else in the oven. Their needs. Their emergencies. Their feelings.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He looked away fast. “It’s… what I do.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “It’s what you’ve learned to do.”

Wes swallowed hard.

Then, because silence was dangerous, Wes turned toward the small back counter and grabbed a tin. “Holiday beverage of your choice,” Wes muttered. “Per the stupid package.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Tea.”

Wes snorted. “Of course.”

He set the kettle on, pulled out the cinnamon-chamomile blend, and moved like he knew where to put his hands even when his heart didn’t know what to do with itself.

Sam leaned against the steel table, watching him with a steady attention that made Wes feel seen in a way he wasn’t used to.

Wes poured tea, then hesitated, then grabbed a plate and put two cookies on it. A peace offering. A habit. A way of saying something without saying it.

He set the plate down in front of Sam.

Sam’s gaze dropped, then lifted back to Wes. “Thanks.”

Wes shrugged. “Don’t make it weird.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You made it sweet.”

Wes groaned. “That’s worse.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes stared at him. “You’re doing that on purpose.”

Sam’s expression stayed calm. “Sometimes.”

Wes’s mouth twitched.

They stood there in the quiet, tea steaming between them. The bakery hummed, steady as a heartbeat.

Wes swallowed. “So,” he said, because he couldn’t not fill space. “Tour ends here.”

Sam’s gaze stayed on him. “And then what.”

Wes’s chest tightened. His mouth went dry.

This was the part where Wes usually fled. Where he’d joke, distract, do chores, lock the door, send people away.

But Sam wasn’t people. Sam was… Sam.

Wes set his mug down carefully. “Then,” Wes said, voice low, “we keep it simple.”

Sam nodded once. “Simple.”

Wes stepped closer, slow. No rushing. No performance. Just choosing.

Wes lifted his eyes. “Can I kiss you.”

Sam didn’t tease. He didn’t smirk. His voice came soft and steady. “Yes.”

Wes leaned in and kissed him. Warm. Unhurried. The kind of kiss that made the bakery feel too small and exactly right.

Sam’s hand settled at Wes’s waist, grounding. Wes’s fingers curled into Sam’s sweater like he needed proof.

Sam pulled back just enough to murmur, “Still okay.”

Wes exhaled. “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Good.”

Wes swallowed, heartbeat loud. “If we keep going,” Wes said, careful, “I don’t want it to turn into… something I can’t handle.”

Sam’s eyes stayed steady. “We stop whenever you want.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Okay.”

Sam’s voice stayed gentle. “Tell me what you want.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed, then he forced the truth out. “I want… closeness. I want you. But I want it slow.”

Sam nodded. “Slow.”

Wes stepped in again, kissing him softer this time, his body relaxing as Sam matched him, steady and patient.

Wes rested his forehead against Sam’s for a moment, breathing.

Then Wes whispered, “Upstairs.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Okay.”

Wes closed his eyes briefly, relief and fear tangling together.

Sam didn’t rush him. He just took Wes’s hand and waited for Wes to squeeze back.

Wes did.

They turned off the prep lights, left the bakery glowing dim in the front, and climbed the stairs with their fingers linked like a quiet promise neither of them was ready to name out loud.

---

## Chapter 10: The Morning That Doesn’t Break

Wes woke up before his alarm because of course he did.

His body was wired for responsibility the way some people were wired for caffeine.

He lay still for a second.

Sam was beside him, warm and solid, breathing slow, one arm loosely around Wes like it was normal.

Wes’s throat tightened.

He waited for the panic. For the drop. For the sudden urge to get up and scrub the kitchen counters until his feelings evaporated.

It didn’t come.

Not immediately.

Instead, Wes felt something worse.

Peace.

Wes stared at the ceiling like it had personally betrayed him.

Sam shifted slightly, sleepy sound in his throat. His arm tightened for a second, like his body was checking that Wes was still there.

Wes’s breath shuddered out.

“You’re still here,” Wes whispered, barely audible.

Sam’s voice was rough with sleep. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “Good.”

Sam made a soft sound that might’ve been agreement, then pressed his face into Wes’s hair for one brief second before settling again.

Wes lay there, caught between wanting to move and wanting to stay.

He didn’t know how long “stay” was allowed to last.

Eventually, Sam’s eyes opened, slow.

He blinked at the light filtering through the curtains, then looked at Wes, gaze steady even when sleepy.

“Morning,” Sam murmured.

Wes’s mouth went dry. “Morning.”

Sam’s voice was low. “You okay.”

Wes glared weakly. “Stop asking me that.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Answer anyway.”

Wes exhaled, then surprised himself. “Yeah,” Wes admitted quietly. “I’m okay.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Good.”

Wes rolled his eyes, but it didn’t have heat. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes’s lips twitched.

Sam shifted, careful, and asked softly, “Do you want me to get up. Or stay.”

Wes’s chest tightened.

The honest answer came too fast. “Stay,” Wes whispered.

Sam nodded once, calm. “Okay.”

Wes stared at him, and the word didn’t feel like a trap. It felt like an anchor.

Wes swallowed. “We have… Day Three.”

Sam’s brow lifted. “What’s Day Three.”

Wes grimaced. “Lantern Walk rehearsal. Noel’s doing ‘romantic lighting.’ Hugh is doing… Hugh.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “We’ll survive.”

Wes muttered, “That’s what you said about mistletoe.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “And you survived.”

Wes exhaled a laugh, then leaned in and kissed Sam briefly, like he couldn’t stop himself.

Sam’s hand slid to Wes’s jaw for a moment, gentle, then he pulled back slightly. “Still okay.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Good.”

Wes groaned into the pillow. “You’re never going to stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes peeked at him. “Why.”

Sam’s expression softened, serious under the warmth. “Because you deserve to be asked.”

Wes went still.

His throat tightened in that stupid, stingy way.

Wes looked away fast. “Tea,” he muttered. “I need tea.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Tea.”

Wes shoved the blankets back and escaped to the kitchen like it was a tactical retreat.

He put the kettle on, moved through the ritual, and felt his body settle into the familiar comfort of small tasks.

Sam joined him a minute later, quiet, leaning against the doorway.

Wes glanced at him. “You’re going to get attached.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “I already am.”

Wes froze.

Sam didn’t soften it with a joke. He didn’t walk it back.

He just stood there, steady, letting the truth exist in the room without demanding Wes match it.

Wes swallowed hard. “That’s… dangerous.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Okay.”

Wes stared. “Don’t you dare.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Sorry.”

Wes blinked. “Was that real.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Yes.”

Wes exhaled, shaky, then pushed a mug toward Sam like he was buying his way out of emotional responsibility.

Sam took it. Their fingers brushed.

Wes’s pulse jumped, traitor.

Outside, the town slowly woke under snow.

Inside, Wes realized something terrifying.

This morning wasn’t breaking him.

It was teaching him what not-breaking felt like.

## Chapter 11: Day Three, Lanterns, and Controlled Exposure

By the time they got to Evergreen Square, the world looked like a postcard someone had aggressively curated.

The trees were wrapped in lights. Lanterns hung from hooks along the walkway like little captured suns. Snow glittered on everything like the town had decided to become art.

Noel stood in the center of it all with a clipboard and the energy of a man who’d never met a plan he couldn’t romanticize.

“Okay!” Noel announced to the assembled volunteers. “Lantern Walk rehearsal. We need flow, we need timing, we need vibes.”

Eben stood two steps behind him with a list and an expression that said *vibes are not a measurable outcome.*

Hugh wore a scarf that trailed behind him like a dramatic cape.

Wes stepped in, shoulders tight, scanning for hazards.

Sam stayed beside him, calm.

Wes muttered, “This is going to be a nightmare.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “We have a code word.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Don’t say it.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes glared. “That one was smug.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Noel spotted them and beamed. “There they are! My two favorite competent men!”

Wes pointed a finger. “Noel.”

Noel held up both hands in surrender. “I’m not doing anything. I’m being normal.”

Eben’s voice, flat: “He is lying.”

Noel clutched his chest. “Et tu, Frost.”

Noel bounced closer, lowering his voice like he was sharing government secrets. “Quick question. Are you two doing okay after last night.”

Wes’s spine stiffened. “Noel.”

Noel’s expression softened, genuine. “I mean it. No jokes.”

Wes blinked, caught off guard by sincerity.

Sam answered calmly, saving Wes from having to. “We’re fine.”

Noel nodded once, satisfied, then brightened instantly because he couldn’t help himself. “Great! Then I’m going to assign you both to lantern distribution, which involves walking side-by-side in a very romantic way, but purely for logistics.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Noel.”

Noel grinned. “Logistics.”

Eben stepped in, flat. “It is logistics.”

Wes looked at Eben. “Are you in on this.”

Eben’s gaze stayed cold. “The lanterns must be distributed.”

Noel whispered, delighted, “He’s shipping you.”

Eben walked away without acknowledging the concept of shipping.

Wes exhaled, then took a lantern crate like it was a burden he deserved.

Sam took the other crate, calm.

They walked the route, setting lanterns into hooks along the path, working in rhythm.

Wes kept his focus on the task. On the snow. On the metal hooks.

He did not focus on the fact that Sam was beside him in the cold, steady as a heartbeat.

Halfway down the path, an older couple approached, smiling warmly.

Mrs. Alden, bundled in a thick coat, peered at Wes. “You’re working too hard, honey.”

Wes forced a smile. “It’s my brand.”

Mr. Alden chuckled and looked at Sam. “And you’re the one keeping him from falling apart.”

Wes froze.

Sam didn’t. “I’m trying,” Sam said simply.

Mrs. Alden smiled, soft. “Good. We like seeing you with someone steady.”

Wes’s throat tightened.

He braced for gossip, for teasing, for prying.

But the couple just smiled like it was the most normal thing in the world for Wes to be cared for, then continued down the lantern path arm-in-arm.

Wes exhaled slowly.

Sam glanced at him. “You okay.”

Wes muttered, “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Answer anyway.”

Wes swallowed, then surprised himself again. “Yeah,” Wes said quietly. “That… didn’t feel bad.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Good.”

Wes’s shoulders loosened a fraction.

They kept walking, setting lanterns.

At the end of the path, Noel waved them over, bright and triumphant. “Perfect! Vibes immaculate! Now, we do a quick run-through with pairs.”

Wes’s stomach dropped. “Pairs.”

Noel smiled sweetly. “Pairs.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to Wes, checking in without making it a scene.

Wes inhaled.

Wes exhaled.

Then, quietly, Wes did something small, deliberate.

He stepped just a half-step closer to Sam.

Not enough for the town to clap. Not enough for Noel to faint. Just enough that Wes could feel Sam’s warmth through their coats.

Sam’s expression softened, almost imperceptibly.

Wes kept his gaze forward, voice low. “This is not a declaration.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “I know.”

Wes swallowed. “But… you can stand close.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes, but his mouth twitched.

The lanterns glowed around them like the world was trying to be gentle.

And Wes, against every habit he’d built to survive, let himself be gently seen.

**[STOP WRITING]**





## Chapter 12: Pairs, Paths, and Noel’s Crimes Against Subtlety

Noel’s “pairs” plan was exactly as benign as Wes feared.

Meaning: not benign at all.

He clapped his hands like a man summoning the laws of romance. “Okay! We’re doing a timing run. Two-by-two down the lantern path. Slow pace. Soft spacing. People should feel… enchanted.”

Eben stood beside him with a stopwatch and the face of a man who wanted to throw the word *enchanted* into the river.

Hugh had somehow acquired a portable speaker and was playing instrumental jazz carols at a volume that implied he was trying to seduce the entire town.

Wes took a slow breath, hand tight on the lantern crate. Sam stayed beside him, calm, shoulder nearly brushing.

Wes muttered, “This is a trap.”

Sam’s voice was low. “It’s a rehearsal.”

Wes shot him a look. “It’s Noel.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay, it’s a trap.”

That made Wes’s mouth twitch in spite of himself.

Noel called names with the zeal of a wedding officiant.

“Mrs. Alden and Mr. Alden, you’re up first. Love wins, etcetera.”

The Aldens went, shamelessly adorable.

“Next,” Noel announced, eyes sparkling with intent, “Wes and Sam.”

Wes’s stomach dropped.

Noel smiled angelically. “For logistics.”

Wes hissed, “Noel.”

Noel held up his clipboard like a shield. “Lantern flow requires you. Your shoulders are the correct width. Your vibes are… stubbornly compelling.”

Eben said flatly, “Walk.”

The crowd of volunteers watched with cheerful curiosity, not predatory, not cruel. Just… interested. Because humans would rather watch two people with unresolved tension than pay taxes.

Wes swallowed.

Sam angled his head slightly toward Wes, quiet check-in without spectacle. “Want out.”

Wes could say cinnamon. He could pull the ripcord.

Instead, he surprised himself by saying, “No.”

Sam’s brows lifted just a fraction.

Wes added, low and stubborn, “Not yet.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay.”

Wes exhaled, then stepped forward onto the lantern path.

The lanterns glowed in soft amber along the walkway, snow reflecting light back up so everything looked unreal and gentle. The air smelled like pine and cold and some distant hint of cinnamon from Candle & Crumb clinging to Wes’s coat.

Wes walked at the pace Noel requested, which was a pace Wes normally reserved for funerals and awkward family dinners.

Sam matched him without effort, stride steady, presence quiet.

Wes’s shoulders were tense, waiting for the moment someone said something, asked something, nudged too close.

But no one did.

They just watched. Smiled. Let it be.

Halfway down the path, Noel’s voice carried from behind them, too loud and too pleased. “GORGEOUS. PERFECT. KEEP THAT ENERGY.”

Wes muttered, “I’m going to push him into a snowbank.”

Sam’s voice was low. “Later.”

Wes shot him a look. “Don’t say it like that.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Like what.”

Wes pointed ahead, voice tight knowing he was about to be stupid. “Just… keep walking.”

Sam did.

At the end of the path was a little arch made of pine boughs and twinkle lights. Noel had clearly “borrowed” it from somewhere. It looked like something you’d propose under.

Wes stopped short.

Above the arch, hanging like a threat, was mistletoe.

Of course it was.

Wes stared at it, rage blooming.

Behind them, volunteers giggled softly. Noel made a noise like he was about to faint from joy.

Wes’s body tried to pivot away.

Sam didn’t touch him. He just stood close, voice low. “We don’t have to.”

Wes’s throat tightened.

This was the fork in the road.

Wes could bolt, preserve privacy, preserve control.

Or he could take one small step that wasn’t a crisis response.

Wes swallowed hard, then said, barely audible, “Not here.”

Sam nodded immediately. “Okay.”

Wes inhaled, then did something that felt like jumping off a roof with a parachute he hadn’t tested.

He reached down and brushed his knuckles against Sam’s glove.

Not a dramatic handhold. Not a display.

Just contact. A tether. A choice.

Sam’s gaze dropped to it, then back to Wes, steady warmth in his eyes.

Wes’s voice came out tight. “Walk past it.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “Yes.”

They walked under the arch without stopping. The mistletoe hovered overhead, unused, a thwarted plant.

Noel made a distressed sound. “THE RESTRAINT. THE TENSION. IT’S CINEMATIC.”

Eben’s voice, flat: “Move the line.”

Wes’s heartbeat hammered, but he kept walking, Sam beside him, their gloves brushing once more like a quiet victory.

When they reached the far end, Noel waved wildly. “Again! Everyone again!”

Wes turned to Sam, deadpan. “If he makes us do this twice, I’m committing actual arson.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “We can leave after this run.”

Wes swallowed. “Promise.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “Promise.”

Wes nodded once, then turned back to the lantern path like he hadn’t just done something terrifyingly brave.

And somehow, the world didn’t collapse.

It just kept glowing.

---

## Chapter 13: Slow, Private, and Real

They left right after the second run.

Sam didn’t have to drag Wes. Wes went willingly, coat pulled tight, jaw set like he was outrunning the aftershock of being seen.

They cut through the square, past the lit trees and the sleepy storefronts, snow crunching under their boots like a steady metronome.

When Candle & Crumb came into view, Wes’s shoulders eased a fraction. Familiar ground. Safe territory. His kingdom of butter and order.

Wes unlocked the door, stepped inside, then waited just long enough for Sam to follow before bolting it behind them like the world outside could pry.

He exhaled hard.

Sam stood a few feet away, quiet, watching without staring. “You okay.”

Wes shot him a look. “If you ask that one more time, I’m going to put you in the walk-in freezer.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “That might solve the overheating.”

Wes blinked, then laughed once, sharp and relieved.

He shoved his gloves into his pocket, paced two steps, then stopped and turned on Sam like his body had decided the truth was happening whether Wes approved or not.

“That arch,” Wes said, voice rough. “The mistletoe.”

Sam nodded, waiting.

Wes swallowed. “I thought you were going to…,” he started, then stopped because naming his fear felt too naked.

Sam’s voice stayed low. “Do something you didn’t want.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He nodded once.

Sam stepped closer, slow. “I won’t.”

Wes’s chest ached at the certainty in it. “I know,” Wes muttered, and hated how much he meant it.

Sam’s gaze held his. “You did good out there.”

Wes rolled his eyes automatically, but the gesture was weak. “I barely touched you.”

Sam’s voice was soft. “You chose it.”

Wes swallowed hard.

He turned away, because being looked at like that made his skin feel too thin. He moved behind the counter, hands finding familiar tasks like a life raft, wiping a surface that was already clean.

Sam didn’t follow him behind the counter. He stayed on the other side, respectful of Wes’s lines.

Wes’s voice came out quieter. “I don’t want… a town romance.”

Sam’s voice was steady. “Okay.”

Wes glared reflexively. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’m listening.”

Wes exhaled, then forced more out. “I want you. I want… this.” He gestured vaguely between them like the air itself might cooperate. “But I want it… mine. Not Noel’s.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Then it’s yours.”

Wes’s throat tightened painfully.

Wes set the cloth down, fingers trembling slightly, and finally looked at Sam. “How are you so calm.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Practice.”

Wes swallowed. “I don’t have practice.”

Sam nodded, simple and true. “Then we go slow.”

Wes’s breath hitched, and the want in him surged like it had been waiting all day.

Wes stepped out from behind the counter.

He crossed the space between them, stopping close enough that their coats almost touched. He didn’t kiss Sam right away. He just stood there, breathing, letting himself feel the warmth of another person without bracing for impact.

Wes’s voice was low. “Can I…”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Yes. Tell me.”

Wes swallowed. “Can I kiss you.”

Sam’s answer was immediate, soft. “Please.”

Wes kissed him.

It started careful, then deepened as Wes’s hands found Sam’s sweater, gripping lightly like he needed proof this was real.

Sam’s hands came up slowly, giving Wes time to pull away, then settled at Wes’s waist with quiet steadiness.

Wes made a small sound against Sam’s mouth, half frustration, half relief.

Sam broke the kiss just enough to murmur, “More or less.”

Wes blinked, startled by the phrasing, then exhaled. “More.”

Sam nodded, and the way he returned the kiss was still controlled but warmer, like Sam was letting himself show want without letting it become pressure.

Wes’s fingers slid up to Sam’s neck, thumb brushing skin.

Sam inhaled sharply, then steadied.

Wes pulled back slightly, eyes searching Sam’s. “You’re okay.”

Sam’s gaze didn’t waver. “I’m good. You.”

Wes swallowed. “I’m… hungry.”

Sam’s brows lifted a fraction, not teasing. “For what.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed, but he forced it out because he was tired of being afraid of his own wanting. “For you. For being held. For… not doing everything.”

Sam’s expression softened in a way that made Wes’s throat tighten.

“Okay,” Sam said quietly, then caught himself and amended, softer, “I’m here.”

Wes’s eyes stung, stupidly.

He leaned in again, kissing Sam, then nudged him backward until Sam’s hips bumped the counter edge.

Sam let it happen, hands staying gentle, letting Wes take the lead at his own pace.

Wes’s mouth moved to Sam’s jaw, then his throat, tasting skin, breathing him in like he was learning a language with his lips.

Sam’s hand slid up Wes’s back, slow and grounding, fingers pressing lightly like a promise.

Wes shuddered.

Sam’s voice was low near his ear. “Tell me if you want me to stop.”

Wes’s voice came out rough. “Don’t stop.”

Sam nodded once, and Wes felt it in the way Sam’s body stayed steady beneath him.

Wes pulled back, breathing hard, and whispered, “Upstairs.”

Sam’s eyes held his. “Yes.”

Wes took Sam’s hand, and this time he didn’t treat it like a dangerous thing. He treated it like something he wanted.

They turned off the lights, climbed the stairs, and Wes didn’t sprint ahead. He didn’t apologize.

He just led.

In the bedroom, everything stayed slow, exactly like Wes had asked.

Clothes came off in unhurried steps, hands pausing for permission, mouths checking in between kisses. Sam let Wes set the pace, let him stop and breathe, let him decide what “more” meant minute by minute.

When Wes finally crawled into bed and Sam followed, Wes reached for Sam’s wrist and tugged him closer, voice low. “Here.”

Sam came willingly, arm wrapping around Wes with quiet solidity.

Wes turned into him, skin against skin, warmth everywhere, and let himself feel how safe it was to be wanted without being demanded.

Wes’s mouth found Sam’s again, slower now, deeper, and the heat built in a way that didn’t feel like a cliff.

It felt like a staircase.

Wes moved with Sam’s guidance, learning what his body wanted when it wasn’t braced for punishment. Learning that pleasure could be gentle. That intensity didn’t have to mean danger.

Sam kept his voice low, steady, asking when he needed to, listening when Wes spoke in fragments, holding when Wes went quiet.

And when Wes finally came undone, it wasn’t loud or performative.

It was a gasp into Sam’s shoulder and a tremble that felt like relief, like something in Wes’s chest had finally unclenched.

Sam held him through it, hand on Wes’s back, voice low. “I’ve got you.”

Wes lay there afterward, breathing hard, forehead pressed to Sam’s collarbone like he needed the contact to stay real.

Sam didn’t move away. He didn’t make jokes. He didn’t ask for anything else.

He just stayed.

Wes whispered, ragged, “That was… a lot.”

Sam’s voice was soft. “Good a lot or too much.”

Wes swallowed, then let himself say it. “Good.”

Sam’s arm tightened gently around him. “Okay.”

Wes huffed a weak laugh. “You’re impossible.”

Sam’s mouth tipped against Wes’s hair. “Yeah.”

Wes’s eyes stung again. He hated it. He loved it.

He whispered, so quiet it barely existed, “Don’t leave.”

Sam’s answer was immediate and absolute. “I’m not going anywhere.”

---

## Chapter 14: The Wobble That Doesn’t Become a War

Wes woke the next morning with his body heavy in the best way and his brain already trying to rewrite everything into a manageable narrative.

He lay still for a beat, listening.

Sam’s breathing was slow beside him, arm still around Wes like it had never moved.

Wes swallowed.

The panic didn’t hit.

Instead, his brain tried a different sabotage: **do more. earn it. repay it.**

Wes slipped out of bed as quietly as possible, padded to the kitchen, and immediately started making a list in his head.

Bake early. Deliver to the square. Prep for Day Four. Help Noel. Fix the lantern hooks. Make extra cocoa mix. Replace Hugh’s craft tape with something less morally flexible.

He was halfway through boiling water when Sam’s voice drifted from the doorway, rough with sleep. “Wes.”

Wes froze like a kid caught stealing.

Sam leaned against the frame, hair messy, eyes steady. “What are you doing.”

Wes tried for casual. “Tea.”

Sam’s gaze held him. “And the list.”

Wes’s jaw tightened. “What list.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “The one on your face.”

Wes exhaled through his nose. “We have things to do.”

Sam stepped closer, slow. “Do we.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Yes.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Tell me.”

Wes’s mouth opened, and the flood came out, fast and clipped like he could outrun the vulnerability if he spoke quickly enough. “Day Four is the carol concert setup, Noel’s going to need pastries, the community pantry table needs labels, and Hugh is definitely going to do something with glitter, and I promised Mrs. Alden I’d deliver her rye loaf, and also if I don’t keep moving I’m going to start thinking.”

Sam listened without interrupting.

Then Sam said, simply, “Come here.”

Wes bristled. “I’m busy.”

Sam’s gaze sharpened slightly, not angry, just firm. “Wes.”

Wes stopped.

Because Sam’s tone wasn’t commanding. It was… protective.

Wes swallowed and stepped closer.

Sam reached out, cupped the back of Wes’s neck gently, thumb resting at his hairline like an anchor. “You don’t have to earn last night.”

Wes’s throat tightened instantly. “I’m not.”

Sam’s eyes stayed steady. “You are.”

Wes tried to look away. Sam didn’t force him back. He just kept the touch, warm and calm.

Wes’s voice came out rough. “If I stop moving, I feel… stupid.”

Sam’s brow lifted slightly. “Why.”

Wes swallowed. “Because it feels like I’m waiting for you to change your mind.”

Sam’s hand stayed at Wes’s neck, thumb stroking once. “I won’t.”

Wes’s eyes stung, stupidly. “You can’t promise that.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “I can promise this: if something changes, I will tell you. I won’t disappear. I won’t punish you with silence.”

Wes’s breath hitched.

Sam added, softer, “But nothing is changing today.”

Wes swallowed hard.

He nodded once, a tiny surrender.

Sam’s gaze softened. “Eat something.”

Wes scoffed weakly. “Bossy.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes huffed a laugh, then leaned forward, forehead resting against Sam’s shoulder for half a second because apparently that was his new coping strategy: **lean on Sam instead of baking himself into dust.**

Sam’s arm came around him, steady.

Wes whispered, muffled, “I hate feelings.”

Sam’s voice was low. “I know.”

Wes pulled back, eyes wet in a way he’d deny under oath, and grabbed a pastry from the counter like it was a shield. “Fine. Eating.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Good.”

Wes pointed with the pastry. “And after, we go help Noel.”

Sam nodded. “Together.”

Wes swallowed, then managed, “Yeah.”

Outside, snow fell soft and quiet, the town waking into Day Four’s gentle chaos.

Inside, Wes took a bite of pastry, let his shoulders drop, and did something he almost never did.

He let someone share the load.

**[STOP WRITING]**


## Chapter 15: Day Four, Carol Chaos, and Shared Weight

Evergreen Square on Day Four looked like the town had decided to stage a holiday movie and then panic halfway through production.

There were folding chairs everywhere. Extension cords snaked across the snow like traps. A volunteer choir huddled in scarves, warming up with the haunted seriousness of people about to sing in public.

Noel stood at the center of it all with a headset that did not belong to him and a clipboard he was treating like a holy text.

“Okay!” Noel called. “We need stage lights checked, cocoa station staffed, and the tree area cleared of toddlers before they start climbing like festive raccoons.”

Eben was two steps behind him with a list and the grim satisfaction of a man watching incompetence try to take physical form.

Hugh appeared out of nowhere holding a crate labeled **ORNAMENTS: DO NOT SHAKE** and shaking it.

Eben’s voice went flat and lethal. “Everhart.”

Hugh paused mid-shake, unrepentant. “The ornaments need to be emotionally prepared.”

Eben took the crate from him and set it down like he was defusing a bomb. “Stop.”

Hugh clutched his heart. “Oppression.”

Wes arrived with a tray of pastries, a thermos of strong coffee, and the resigned expression of a man who had accepted that the universe would never let him be calm again.

Sam walked beside him, carrying a second tray like it was nothing.

Wes glanced sideways, low. “Thank you.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “Together.”

Wes’s chest tightened at the word like it was both comfort and threat.

Noel spotted them and beamed, sprinting over in a way that suggested he had no internal concept of rest. “There they are! The pastry cavalry!”

Wes lifted the tray. “Don’t get sentimental.”

Noel ignored him. “This is perfect. You’re perfect. These are perfect. I’m going to cry.”

Wes muttered, “Threats.”

Noel’s face softened briefly, sincerity slipping through the glitter. “Seriously. Thanks.”

Wes blinked, caught off guard by the lack of joke.

Sam spoke first, saving Wes from having to be emotionally competent in public. “Where do you want it.”

Noel snapped back into efficiency like a switch. “Cocoa station, near the stage. Also, can one of you help with lantern placement near the audience row. The lighting is… romantic.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Noel.”

Noel held up both hands. “It’s not a trap. It’s ambiance.”

Eben’s voice drifted over without mercy. “It is a trap.”

Noel glared. “Eben!”

Eben didn’t blink. “I am correct.”

Wes exhaled and looked at Sam. “We do the lanterns. Quick.”

Sam nodded once. “Quick.”

They moved along the audience row, setting lanterns in the hooks Noel had installed. Wes worked fast, precise. Sam matched him, steady, and for once Wes didn’t feel like he was the only person holding the day together.

Halfway down the row, a lantern hook slipped loose, and Wes instinctively reached up.

Sam’s hand came up at the same time, steadying the hook, fingers brushing Wes’s wrist.

Wes froze.

It was nothing.

It also felt like everything.

Sam didn’t flinch. He didn’t turn it into a moment. He just held the hook in place, calm, and said quietly, “Got it.”

Wes swallowed. “Yeah.”

They finished the row and stepped back.

Noel waved from near the stage, triumphant. “Beautiful! Vibes achieved!”

Wes muttered, “I hate that sentence.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I know.”

Wes glanced at him, irritated by how easy Sam was making this, and by how much Wes wanted to lean into it.

Wes cleared his throat. “We should…” he started, then realized he didn’t actually know what “we should” meant anymore, because Sam kept offering a version of life where Wes didn’t have to do it alone.

Sam waited, patient.

Wes exhaled. “We should check the cocoa station.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

They headed over, trays in hand, and Wes felt the smallest, strangest thing.

Pride.

Not in the pastries. Not in the work.

In the fact that he’d asked for help and the world hadn’t punished him for it.

At the cocoa station, Mrs. Alden smiled at them like she’d known Wes his whole life and had been waiting for someone to get under his armor.

“You boys look busy,” she said warmly.

Wes set the tray down. “Busy is the only setting Noel has.”

Mrs. Alden chuckled, then looked at Sam with kind approval. “And you,” she said, “you’re good for him.”

Wes’s spine stiffened, reflexive panic flaring.

Sam didn’t hesitate. He didn’t look at Wes like he was waiting for permission to exist.

He just answered gently and neutrally, like it was the most normal thing in the world. “I’m trying.”

Mrs. Alden patted Sam’s arm through his coat, satisfied, and wandered off.

Wes stared at the cocoa urn like it was suddenly fascinating.

Sam’s voice was low. “You okay.”

Wes muttered, “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Answer anyway.”

Wes swallowed. “That wasn’t… bad.”

Sam nodded once. “Good.”

Wes exhaled, then surprised himself by nudging Sam’s elbow with his own, a tiny contact that said *thanks* without putting it in words.

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly.

Noel’s voice boomed from the stage. “CHOIR, POSITIONS!”

Wes flinched. “Here we go.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “We can leave after the first set.”

Wes nodded. “Promise.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “Promise.”

The choir began to sing, voices rising into the cold like something fragile and bright.

Wes stood near the cocoa station, hands wrapped around a paper cup, watching the crowd settle into the music.

Sam stood beside him, close enough that their coats brushed once when someone passed behind them.

Wes didn’t move away.

The carols rolled on, sweet and nostalgic and slightly off-key in places. Kids wiggled. Couples leaned into each other. Someone near the back quietly cried into a scarf.

Wes felt the familiar urge to scan for emergencies, for tasks, for something to fix.

Instead, he let himself just stand there for a minute.

Just listen.

Just breathe.

Sam’s voice went low near his ear. “Want to go.”

Wes hesitated, then shook his head. “Not yet.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He didn’t know when “not yet” had turned into “I can stay.”

But it had.

And the world hadn’t ended.

---

## Chapter 16: The Quiet Place After the Song

They left when Noel started a “final festive encore” that sounded like it would last until spring.

Wes slipped out with Sam, quietly, before anyone could draft him into chair-stacking or emotional conversations about the meaning of carols.

Outside, the snow had slowed. The square glowed behind them, lights soft and warm like the town was trying to be gentle on purpose.

Wes walked beside Sam, hands in his pockets, shoulders finally less rigid than they’d been all week.

After a block, Wes said quietly, “I didn’t hate it.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to him. “The concert.”

Wes nodded once, like admitting it was a crime. “Yeah.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Good.”

Wes rolled his eyes. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes huffed a laugh, then grew serious again, voice rougher. “Mrs. Alden.”

Sam didn’t pretend not to understand. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “That kind of… thing. People saying stuff.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Do you want me to shut it down.”

Wes blinked. The question wasn’t defensive. It wasn’t possessive. It was an offer.

Wes exhaled slowly. “Not… harshly.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes added, quieter, honest. “But I don’t want it to become a story.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Then it won’t.”

Wes’s chest tightened at the certainty.

He looked away fast, because his emotions were getting entitled again.

They reached Candle & Crumb.

Wes unlocked the door, stepped inside, and immediately exhaled like his body recognized safety before his brain did.

Sam followed.

Wes locked up, then leaned back against the door and stared at the ceiling.

“Okay,” Wes said, voice tired. “We survived Day Four.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “We did.”

Wes eyed him. “Don’t ‘we’ me.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “You started it.”

Wes blinked, then realized Sam was right, which was rude.

Wes muttered, “Fine.”

He took off his coat, hung it, then hesitated like he didn’t know what to do with the rest of himself.

Sam, quiet, stepped closer. “Want tea.”

Wes stared. “Do you always fix people with tea.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Sometimes.”

Wes sighed. “Yes. Tea.”

Sam put the kettle on like it was a ritual now, like this was something they did after chaos: return to warmth, to simple things, to the small proof that life could be steady.

Wes watched him for a beat, then said, very quietly, “I didn’t run today.”

Sam’s gaze lifted, soft. “No.”

Wes swallowed. “I wanted to.”

Sam nodded once. “I know.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “But I didn’t.”

Sam’s voice went gentler. “That matters.”

Wes exhaled shakily, annoyed by the sting in his eyes. “Stop being right.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes’s mouth twitched, then he crossed the space between them and leaned his forehead against Sam’s shoulder for a moment, just to feel the solid reality of him.

Sam’s hand came up, resting at the back of Wes’s neck, gentle.

Wes whispered, muffled, “Tomorrow is Day Five.”

Sam’s voice was low near his ear. “What’s Day Five.”

Wes groaned. “Cookie decorating for kids.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “That sounds safe.”

Wes muttered, “It sounds like frosting warfare.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “We’ll survive.”

Wes lifted his head, looked at Sam, and the warmth in his chest felt less like fear and more like something he could keep.

Wes swallowed. “Stay.”

Sam didn’t hesitate. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes weakly. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

The kettle clicked.

Sam poured two mugs. Wes took his without speaking, fingers brushing Sam’s again.

Wes didn’t flinch.

He didn’t pull away.

He just let it happen.

And for a man who’d spent years bracing for loss, that was its own kind of bravery.

## Chapter 17: Day Five, Frosting Warfare, and Children as Tiny Gods

Wes learned two things within the first three minutes of the kid’s cookie-decorating event.

One: children have no sense of restraint.

Two: Noel had absolutely planned this as a social experiment.

The community center smelled like sugar, cocoa, and impending disaster. Folding tables were covered with trays of plain cookies, bowls of frosting in every holiday color, and enough sprinkles to qualify as a municipal budget item.

Noel stood at the front wearing an apron that said **SANTA’S FAVORITE MENACE**.

Wes stared. “That’s not funny.”

Noel beamed. “It’s accurate.”

Eben stood near the sign-in sheet with his clipboard, looking like a man watching chaos gather mass.

Hugh wore a wreath on his head like a crown and was already teaching a child how to make an “edible glitter halo.”

Wes inhaled, steadying. “This is going to be… loud.”

Sam stood close beside him, calm in a plain sweater, hands in his pockets like he was ready to intercept tiny disasters.

Sam’s voice was low. “We can leave early.”

Wes muttered, “No. I’m not letting Noel win.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “Okay.”

Wes shot him a look. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “You walked under mistletoe yesterday without stopping. I’m not worried about Noel.”

Wes hissed, “That was not the point.”

Noel clapped his hands and called out, “Welcome, tiny artists! Welcome, sugar warriors! Please remember: frosting is for cookies, not hair.”

A child immediately put frosting in his hair.

Noel’s smile didn’t even wobble. “Great. Love the commitment.”

Wes moved to the cookie table like it was his battlefield. He started laying out extra napkins, spacing bowls, setting “safe zones” like he could impose order by force of will.

Sam hovered nearby, quietly taking on the tasks Wes didn’t even realize he was assigning.

A little girl with pigtails stared up at Sam with grave intensity. “Are you a real cop.”

Sam blinked once. “Yes.”

The girl nodded solemnly. “My dad says cops are boring.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Sometimes.”

The girl narrowed her eyes. “Can you arrest my brother.”

Her brother, across the table, was eating sprinkles straight from a bowl like a raccoon.

Sam’s gaze flicked over, calm. “Only if he confesses.”

The boy froze mid-sprinkle, eyes wide. “I confess nothing.”

Wes snorted before he could stop himself.

The girl looked pleased. “You’re funny.”

Sam’s gaze slid to Wes briefly, warm, like he liked the sound of Wes laughing.

Wes immediately pretended he hadn’t.

---

Ten minutes in, frosting became an actual weapon.

A kid fired a stream of green frosting across the table. Another kid retaliated with red sprinkles like shrapnel. A third kid made a cookie that was just frosting with a cookie underneath as structural support.

Noel floated through the carnage like a cheerful disaster consultant. “Yes! Creativity! Expression!”

Eben’s voice was flat. “This is a biohazard.”

Hugh, reverent, whispered, “It’s modern art.”

Wes wiped frosting off his sleeve and muttered, “I hate everyone.”

Sam leaned in, low. “You love them.”

Wes glared. “Don’t psychoanalyze me.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Noted.”

Wes squinted. “That was sarcasm.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Also noted.”

Wes’s mouth twitched, traitor.

A mom approached the table, smiling politely in the way people do when they’re about to ask Wes for something. “Wes, can I borrow you for a second.”

Wes’s spine tightened automatically. “Depends.”

She laughed. “My son has a nut allergy, and I just want to make sure…”

Wes softened immediately, focus snapping into place. “Of course,” he said, already moving. “We’ll keep him to the left side. No cross-contact.”

Sam stayed close without hovering, helping direct kids like a gentle traffic controller.

The mom glanced at Sam, then back to Wes, smiling. “It’s nice you’ve got help.”

Wes felt the familiar panic twitch.

Sam answered before Wes had to, calm and neutral. “We’re all here to keep the kids from eating glitter.”

The mom laughed and nodded. “Bless you.”

She walked away.

Wes exhaled like he’d been holding his breath.

He glanced at Sam, low. “Thanks.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Anytime.”

That *anytime* hit Wes harder than it should have.

Because Wes was starting to believe it.

---

Half an hour later, Noel announced, “Cookie showcase! Bring your masterpieces!”

Kids surged toward the front with plates held high like offerings.

One cookie had a face. Another had what looked like a tiny frosting pentagram.

Wes stared at the pentagram cookie. “That’s not… festive.”

The kid holding it shrugged. “It’s a snowflake.”

Hugh leaned in, delighted. “Symbolic.”

Eben’s voice was flat. “No.”

Noel held up a cookie covered in sprinkles. “This one is called ‘Santa Explodes!’ Incredible!”

Wes muttered, “Noel is going to get us all cursed.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Probably.”

Wes glanced at Sam’s hands. “You haven’t made a cookie.”

Sam blinked. “I wasn’t assigned.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “That’s not how this works. You’re here. You have to participate.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “Do I.”

Wes gestured toward the frosting. “Make one. A normal one. For the town’s morale.”

Sam looked at the frosting like it was evidence. “Okay.”

Wes watched, baffled, as Sam calmly assembled a cookie with a neat white frosting base, a simple green tree, and a tiny red dot.

Wes blinked. “That’s… competent.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “It’s a tree.”

Wes stared at it, then muttered, “Fine. Give it here.”

Wes grabbed another cookie and, without fully thinking, drew a messy little spiral of frosting on it. Then he added a tiny red dot next to Sam’s dot, like an ornament pairing.

He slid it closer to Sam without making eye contact.

Sam looked down at it.

Then Sam looked up at Wes, warmth in his eyes that made Wes’s throat tighten.

Sam’s voice was low. “Is that… mine.”

Wes muttered, “It’s a cookie.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes hissed, “Stop saying okay like you’re holding something precious.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “You are.”

Wes’s stomach flipped. He looked away fast, cheeks hot.

From across the room, Noel’s voice rose in delighted accusation: “DID YOU TWO JUST MAKE MATCHING COOKIES.”

Wes snapped, “NO.”

Noel clutched his chest. “I’m going to die.”

Eben’s voice was flat. “Don’t.”

Hugh gasped. “This is art.”

Wes pointed at Sam, low. “We’re leaving.”

Sam nodded calmly. “Okay.”

Wes glared. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes grabbed his coat like it was a tactical retreat and marched them out before Noel could produce mistletoe and a photographer.

---

## Chapter 18: The Walk Home and the Thing Wes Says First

The snow had stopped.

The world looked clean and quiet, as if Tinsel Town had decided to apologize for the children.

Wes walked fast at first, hands jammed in his pockets, shoulders tight.

Sam matched his pace without crowding.

After a block, Wes slowed, breath steaming in front of him.

Wes muttered, “I hate Noel.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “You like him.”

Wes glared. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes exhaled a laugh, then rubbed his face like he could wipe away the lingering embarrassment.

“That cookie thing,” Wes said, voice rough.

Sam waited, steady.

Wes swallowed. “I didn’t mean to… do that.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “You didn’t have to mean to. You did it.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “That’s worse.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Why.”

Wes stopped walking.

Sam stopped too, turning slightly, giving Wes space while still staying close enough to feel like an option.

Wes stared at the snow at his feet. “Because it was… easy,” Wes admitted quietly. “And I don’t trust easy.”

Sam didn’t argue. He just nodded once, like he understood that sentence from the inside.

Sam’s voice was low. “Easy doesn’t mean unsafe.”

Wes swallowed hard. “Sometimes it does.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Then we make it safe.”

Wes’s throat tightened, and he hated that he wanted to believe him.

Wes exhaled slowly, then said the thing his body had been circling all day.

“I liked it,” Wes admitted. “The matching cookies. I liked… being on a team with you.”

Sam’s expression softened in a way that made Wes’s chest ache.

Sam’s voice was quiet. “Me too.”

Wes nodded once, like that was all he could handle.

Then, because he was apparently allergic to vulnerability unless it came with forward motion, Wes started walking again.

Sam fell in beside him.

Wes’s voice came out low, almost reluctant. “When people say stuff… like Mrs. Alden… I don’t want to freak out anymore.”

Sam’s gaze slid to him, warm. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Tell me what you want instead.”

Wes blinked, caught.

He thought for a second, then said, carefully, “I want… to be able to say *something* that’s true. Without making it a headline.”

Sam nodded once. “Then we pick something true.”

Wes swallowed. “Like what.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Like ‘He’s with me.’ Or ‘We’re together.’ Or ‘He’s my…’”

Sam stopped himself, watching Wes’s face. “Or we keep it simpler.”

Wes’s breath hitched. He stared ahead, heart thudding.

Then Wes said, quietly, “I can do ‘I’m seeing him.’”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “That’s true.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “And it’s not… a label that feels like a trap.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes huffed a laugh. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

They reached Candle & Crumb.

Wes unlocked the door, then paused on the threshold like he always did.

This time, he didn’t bolt it immediately.

He stood there, looking at the bakery, then at Sam.

Wes’s voice was low. “I’m seeing you.”

Sam didn’t smile like he’d won. He didn’t tease. His eyes just softened.

Sam’s voice came quiet and steady. “I’m seeing you too.”

Wes swallowed hard, then stepped aside, letting Sam in.

The door clicked shut behind them.

And for the first time, the words didn’t feel like a threat.

They felt like a small, real thing Wes could hold.

**[STOP WRITING]**



## Chapter 19: The Bakery, the Words, and the Part Where Wes Doesn’t Backpedal

Candle & Crumb felt warmer after the words.

Not because the thermostat changed. Because Wes did.

He’d said it. Out loud. In the doorway. Like a man who wasn’t terrified of his own truth.

Wes stood there for a beat, hand still on the door, heart thudding like it wanted to argue.

Sam didn’t rush him. Sam didn’t fill the silence with jokes or reassurance.

Sam just stood inside the bakery, calm, eyes soft.

Wes swallowed. “So that’s… a thing I said.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “Yeah.”

Wes narrowed his eyes, defensive reflex twitching. “Don’t act like you’re pleased.”

Sam’s gaze held his, steady. “I am pleased.”

Wes froze.

It wasn’t smug. It wasn’t teasing. It was simple. Honest.

Wes’s chest tightened in that infuriating, warm way that made him want to throw a chair and also curl up and sleep for a year.

Wes muttered, “That’s… dangerous.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “Okay.”

Wes shot him a look. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes exhaled a laugh, sharp and embarrassed, then shrugged off his coat and hung it up like he needed his hands to remember how to exist.

Sam followed suit, folding his coat neatly because of course he did.

Wes pointed at him. “You’re still doing that. The folding.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “It calms me.”

Wes blinked. “You have calming behaviors.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Everyone does.”

Wes stared at him like that was new information. “Mine is baking until my feelings evaporate.”

Sam nodded once. “I’ve noticed.”

Wes grumbled, “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes stayed steady. “I’m not judging.”

Wes’s throat tightened.

He walked behind the counter because he needed the barrier, then immediately started wiping down a surface that was already clean.

Sam stayed on the customer side, respectful of Wes’s lines, leaning lightly against the counter edge.

Wes worked in silence for a minute, letting the routine settle him.

Then Wes said, very quietly, “When you looked at me after I said it… I thought you might make it bigger.”

Sam’s voice was low. “Bigger how.”

Wes swallowed. “Like… a moment.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “It was a moment.”

Wes flinched.

Sam continued, gentle. “But I don’t have to make it a show.”

Wes’s shoulders loosened a fraction. “Good.”

Sam nodded once. “You get to choose the speed.”

Wes exhaled. “Slow.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Slow.”

Wes’s hands paused. He looked up, meeting Sam’s eyes.

Wes’s voice came rough. “I don’t want to hide like I’m ashamed.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Then don’t.”

Wes swallowed. “But I also don’t want the town… in it.”

Sam nodded. “Then the town doesn’t get in.”

Wes’s throat tightened again, because Sam kept saying things like they were obvious and possible.

Wes set the cloth down and stepped out from behind the counter.

He crossed the space between them slowly, stopping close enough to feel Sam’s warmth.

Wes didn’t kiss him right away. He just stood there, breathing, letting his body adjust to closeness that wasn’t a trap.

Wes’s voice was low. “Can you… stay tonight.”

Sam’s answer was immediate and calm. “Yes.”

Wes blinked, caught off guard by how easy it was.

Wes muttered, “Stop being reliable.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes’s lips twitched, then he leaned in and kissed Sam, soft and brief, like punctuation more than escalation.

Sam returned it gently, then pulled back just enough to murmur, “Still okay.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Yes.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Good.”

Wes groaned quietly. “You’re never going to stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes pressed his forehead to Sam’s for a beat, breathing, then whispered, “Tomorrow is Day Six.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “What’s Day Six.”

Wes sighed like the universe was personally mocking him. “Gingerbread House Contest.”

Sam’s brows lifted. “That sounds… messy.”

Wes deadpanned. “It’s structural engineering with sugar and grief.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “We’ll survive.”

Wes muttered, “If Hugh doesn’t weaponize icing.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Probably.”

Wes pulled back, gaze softening despite himself. “If it gets weird tomorrow…”

Sam’s voice was calm. “We leave.”

Wes swallowed. “And if I can’t… say things.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Then you don’t have to. I’ll follow your lead.”

Wes’s chest tightened.

He nodded once. “Okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes huffed a laugh, then turned away to hide how relieved he was.

Humans were ridiculous.

Wes was worse.

## Chapter 20: Day Six, Gingerbread Politics, and the First Time Wes Isn’t the Only One Watching

The community center on Day Six looked like a sugar bomb went off.

Long tables were covered in gingerbread panels, icing bags, bowls of candy, tiny bottles of edible glue, and instruction sheets that no one was going to read.

A banner hung over the front that said:

**GINGERBREAD HOUSE CONTEST: BUILD YOUR DREAMS (AND YOUR ROOF)**

Wes stared at the banner. “That’s ominous.”

Noel, already wearing another themed apron (this one read **I’M ONLY HERE FOR THE DRAMA**), waved cheerfully. “Isn’t it inspiring.”

Eben stood beside the sign-in table with a clipboard and the grim expression of a man who understood that dreams were flammable.

Hugh had brought a rolling cart of decorations and was humming like he’d entered a sacred temple.

Wes arrived with Sam, shoulders tense but not locked.

Sam stayed close, steady as always, scanning the room like it was both a crowd and a responsibility.

Noel spotted them and beamed. “There they are! Our brave volunteers!”

Wes pointed at Noel. “If you say anything about gingerbread being romantic, I’m leaving.”

Noel clasped his hands. “I was going to say it’s architectural.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Noel.”

Noel grinned. “Fine. I’ll say nothing.”

Eben’s voice, flat: “He is lying.”

Noel clutched his chest. “Eben!”

Eben didn’t blink. “Focus.”

Wes and Sam got assigned to “roof support and icing triage,” which was a polite way of saying: stop children from building structural death traps.

At the first table, a kid was trying to attach a roof at a ninety-degree angle.

Wes leaned in. “Buddy. Gravity exists.”

The kid frowned. “Not in my house.”

Sam crouched slightly beside Wes, calm. “Your house is ambitious.”

The kid brightened. “Thanks.”

Wes blinked at Sam, then muttered, “You’re good with kids.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “They’re honest. It’s easier.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “Yeah.”

They moved down the tables, fixing slumping walls, reattaching chimneys, saving candy windows from collapse.

Wes stayed focused. Tasked. Contained.

Then, about twenty minutes in, the room shifted.

Not dramatically. Just… subtly.

Wes noticed people looking.

Not in a cruel way. Not in a prying way.

In the way a small town looks at a pattern forming.

Wes’s shoulders tightened.

A woman near the coffee table smiled at Wes and said, casually, “Officer Rook’s been around the festival a lot this year.”

Wes’s pulse jumped.

Before he could scramble for a reply, Sam answered calmly from beside him, voice neutral. “I’m on community detail.”

The woman nodded, satisfied. “Good. It’s nice having you.”

And then she moved on.

No interrogation. No wink-wink. No headline.

Wes exhaled slowly.

He glanced at Sam, low. “Thank you.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “For what.”

Wes muttered, “For… not making me do a speech.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No speeches.”

Wes’s shoulders loosened a fraction.

They continued the route.

A few tables later, Hugh glided over like a festive shark.

Hugh’s scarf today was red and dramatic. His cart glittered with candy.

“I have a proposal,” Hugh announced, eyes shining.

Wes immediately tensed. “No.”

Hugh ignored him. “A judging twist. A surprise category.”

Eben’s voice drifted over from the sign-in desk, flat and threatening. “No twists.”

Hugh clasped his heart. “Eben, you hate joy.”

Eben didn’t look up. “Correct.”

Hugh turned to Wes and Sam, conspiratorial. “A category for… Most Romantic Gingerbread.”

Wes stared at him. “Hugh.”

Hugh’s eyes sparkled. “Picture it: two gingerbread men. One roof. A shared chimney. Love. Frosting.”

Wes hissed, “Absolutely not.”

Hugh looked wounded. “Why does everyone hate art.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Because you weaponize it.”

Hugh gasped. “Even you, Officer.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Especially me.”

Hugh blinked, then nodded slowly, like he’d been honored. “Fine. No romance category.”

Hugh leaned in toward Wes, whispering like he couldn’t help himself. “But I do love watching you two orbit.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Go away.”

Hugh drifted off, humming.

Wes stared after him, mortified.

Sam’s voice went low. “Want to leave.”

Wes inhaled.

He thought about bolting. About retreating into the bakery where no one could look at him.

Then he thought about yesterday. About the lantern path. About the way it hadn’t killed him to be seen, just a little.

Wes exhaled. “Not yet.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes muttered, “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes’s mouth twitched, then he turned back to the table in front of him.

A little boy was struggling to attach a roof panel.

Wes crouched, focused. “Okay. More icing here. Hold for ten seconds. Don’t panic.”

The boy frowned. “I always panic.”

Wes deadpanned. “Same.”

Sam crouched too, steadying the wall with one hand. “Ten seconds,” Sam said calmly. “You can do ten.”

The boy held, counting under his breath.

The roof stuck.

The boy’s eyes widened. “I did it.”

Wes felt something soften in his chest. “You did.”

The boy beamed, then looked between Wes and Sam and said, matter-of-fact, “You guys are a good team.”

Wes froze.

The boy didn’t smirk. Didn’t tease. Didn’t even realize he’d said something that hit Wes like a bell.

He just went back to slapping candy onto his house with reckless delight.

Wes swallowed hard, staring at the roof like it had suddenly become very interesting.

Sam’s voice was low. “He’s right.”

Wes muttered, “Don’t.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Okay.”

Wes shot him a look. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes exhaled a shaky laugh and, without fully thinking, bumped his shoulder lightly against Sam’s.

A tiny contact. A tiny yes.

Sam didn’t make a big deal of it.

He just stayed.

And for the first time, Wes realized something new.

Sam wasn’t only watching Wes.

Wes was starting to watch Sam too.

Not for danger.

For care.

For what Sam needed.

For how this could be mutual.

Wes swallowed, then said quietly, “After this… you get tea. And you get to be off duty.”

Sam’s brows lifted. “I get tea.”

Wes glared, cheeks warm. “Don’t be smug.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’m not smug.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “You’re smug.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes groaned, then turned back to the icing station and kept working.

But the warmth in his chest didn’t feel like fear anymore.

It felt like something he could carry.

**[STOP WRITING]**





## Chapter 21: Day Seven, Snowman Triage, and Wes Learning to Give Back

By Day Seven, Wes had accepted that Tinsel Town was not a town.

It was an organism.

And during the holidays, it developed opinions, cravings, and emergencies the way a human body developed fevers.

Today’s emergency arrived at 8:12 a.m. in the form of Noel bursting into Candle & Crumb like a festive hurricane.

Wes didn’t look up from his dough. “If someone’s on fire, put them out. If the snowman lost another eye, I don’t care.”

Noel slapped both hands on the counter, breathless. “The snowman is missing his *nose*.”

Wes stared at him. “It’s a snowman.”

Noel’s face was solemn. “It’s the town snowman.”

Wes exhaled through his nose. “Still a snowman.”

Sam, seated at the small table with a mug of tea like he actually believed mornings could be peaceful, lifted his gaze. “What happened to the nose.”

Noel looked personally wounded by the universe. “A raccoon.”

Wes paused, hands in flour. “A raccoon stole a carrot.”

Noel nodded, eyes shining with outrage. “A bold criminal.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “That tracks.”

Wes glared at them both. “We are not doing snowman surgery.”

Noel leaned forward, pleading. “Wes. The snowman is the symbol of togetherness.”

Wes deadpanned. “The snowman is a pile of snow.”

Noel clasped his hands like he was praying. “Please.”

Wes turned toward Sam, low. “Tell him no.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Do you want me to tell him no.”

Wes blinked, annoyed by the question being reasonable. “Yes.”

Sam looked at Noel. Calm. “No.”

Noel held the gaze for three seconds, then pivoted smoothly. “Okay, but will you come help me anyway.”

Wes’s soul left his body.

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Maybe.”

Wes snapped, “SAM.”

Sam’s gaze slid to Wes, steady. “We can make it quick.”

Wes stared at him. “Why do you want to help with a snowman.”

Sam’s expression stayed calm, but there was a softness under it. “Because it matters to people.”

Wes’s throat tightened, because of course that was the answer.

Wes muttered, “Fine. But we’re doing it efficiently. Like a medical procedure.”

Noel beamed. “Bless you.”

Wes pointed a floury finger. “No. Don’t.”

Noel ignored him and practically floated out the door. “Meet at the square! Bring… carrot vibes!”

Wes watched Noel leave, then turned to Sam. “If I die in a snowman-related incident, you have to burn this town down.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Noted.”

Wes squinted. “That’s not a promise.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay. I promise not to burn the town down.”

Wes sighed. “Unhelpful.”

Sam stood, calm, and reached for his coat. “You still want me off duty today.”

Wes paused.

He’d said that yesterday without thinking. A tiny offer. A tiny care.

Wes swallowed. “After the snowman. Yes.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes, but his mouth twitched.

They left together.

---

Evergreen Square was bright with fresh snow and the kind of cold that made your nose sting the second you inhaled. The big town snowman stood near the tree, majestic and ridiculous, its face now disturbingly incomplete.

Noel stood beside it with Eben and Hugh like a crisis committee.

Eben held a replacement carrot in his gloved hand like evidence.

Hugh looked mournful. “He looks… unfinished.”

Wes approached, taking in the scene like a man evaluating a battlefield. “Okay. We attach the carrot. We leave.”

Noel nodded vigorously. “Yes. Simple.”

Hugh gasped. “Simple? This is art restoration.”

Wes ignored him and stepped up to the snowman.

The nose-hole was… worse than Wes expected. It wasn’t a clean missing-carrot situation. It looked like something had gnawed at the face.

Wes grimaced. “That raccoon was committed.”

Sam stepped closer, assessing. “We need to pack snow.”

Wes blinked. “Why are you good at this.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Snow is like… structural filler.”

Wes stared, then muttered, “Of course you’d know.”

Sam didn’t tease. He just crouched and started packing snow into the gap with slow, competent hands.

Wes found himself mirroring the motion, packing snow, smoothing it, shaping a proper base like he was icing a cake.

Noel watched, hands clasped, reverent. “Look at you two. Working in harmony.”

Wes snapped, “Noel.”

Noel made a zip-it gesture but couldn’t stop smiling.

Eben handed Sam the carrot like he was handing over an official document.

Sam took it, steady, then paused and looked at Wes. “You want to do it.”

Wes blinked. “Me.”

Sam nodded. “It’s your snowman.”

Wes’s chest tightened at the phrasing like it meant something more than it did.

Wes huffed. “Fine.”

He took the carrot and pressed it into place.

It stuck.

The snowman looked whole again. Silly and complete under the tree lights.

Noel exhaled dramatically like he’d been holding his breath for hours. “He lives.”

Hugh whispered, “A miracle.”

Eben said flatly, “It is a carrot.”

Noel turned, delighted. “Eben, you’re allergic to wonder.”

Eben walked away.

Noel looked back at Wes and Sam, eyes soft for once. “Thank you,” Noel said quietly. “I know this is ridiculous.”

Wes shrugged, trying not to feel anything. “It’s fine.”

Noel smiled. “It’s not fine. It’s kind.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He looked away fast.

Sam spoke, calm and neutral, saving Wes again. “We should go.”

Noel nodded. “Yes. Go. Be… normal people.”

Wes muttered, “We’re literally repairing snowmen.”

Noel beamed. “Normal!”

Wes and Sam turned away, walking back through the square.

After a few steps, Wes said quietly, “You did that thing again.”

Sam glanced at him. “What thing.”

Wes swallowed. “You gave me… the last step. The carrot.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “You like finishing things.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “That’s not…”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “It is.”

Wes exhaled through his nose, annoyed that Sam kept being correct.

They reached the bakery.

Inside, warmth wrapped around them. Safety.

Wes locked the door, then turned to Sam, hesitating like he didn’t know how to offer care without making it into a transaction.

Wes cleared his throat. “Okay. Off duty.”

Sam’s brows lifted. “Off duty.”

Wes nodded toward the little table. “Sit. I’ll make something. Food. Tea. Whatever you want.”

Sam watched him for a beat, expression soft. “You don’t have to.”

Wes glared, weak. “I want to.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Okay.”

Wes hissed, “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes turned away to hide how the warmth hit him, then started moving through the bakery like the act of feeding someone was the only love language he trusted.

He made grilled cheese on the small back griddle. Cut apples. Put out crackers. Poured tea. Added honey without asking, because he’d noticed Sam took it that way.

Sam sat at the table quietly, watching, not stopping him, not making it weird.

When Wes set the plate down, Sam’s voice was low. “You noticed.”

Wes froze. “What.”

Sam nodded toward the honey. “That.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “It’s… obvious.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “No. It’s care.”

Wes swallowed hard, then shoved his own plate into place and sat like he was annoyed at the chair.

They ate in quiet.

After a few bites, Sam said softly, “This is nice.”

Wes muttered, “It’s a grilled cheese.”

Sam’s gaze held him. “It’s you taking care of me.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He looked down at his food like it had suddenly become fascinating.

Wes forced out, quiet and rough, “I’m not good at that.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “You are.”

Wes exhaled, shaky. “Stop being… kind about it.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes huffed a laugh, then finally looked up at Sam.

Wes’s voice came low. “Tomorrow is Day Eight.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “What’s Day Eight.”

Wes grimaced. “Cookie exchange.”

Sam blinked. “We already did cookies.”

Wes deadpanned. “Noel thinks the town hasn’t reached peak cookie yet.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Of course.”

Wes leaned back in his chair, exhaustion settling in, but it wasn’t the sharp, lonely kind.

It was shared.

Wes watched Sam sip tea, calm and present, and realized something that made his chest ache in a softer way.

Wes wasn’t only being rescued anymore.

Wes was starting to learn how to stay.

## Chapter 22: Day Eight, Cookie Exchange, and the Line Wes Finally Uses

Day Eight happened with less fanfare and more flour.

The cookie exchange filled the community center with trays and tin boxes and the smell of sugar so thick it practically had its own weather system.

Noel stood at the front with a microphone. Again. Because Noel believed silence was a character flaw.

“Welcome to the Great Cookie Swap!” Noel announced. “Please remember: you are here to share, to trade, and to refrain from fistfights over shortbread.”

Wes muttered, “That’s aimed at Hugh.”

Hugh, already clutching a tin like it was a sacred relic, whispered, “These are my children.”

Eben stood near the doorway doing crowd control like the town’s last line of defense.

Wes arrived carrying three tins: peppermint pinwheels, ginger snaps, and the emergency batch of “please don’t cry” sugar cookies.

Sam arrived beside him with exactly one tin.

Wes eyed it. “You made cookies.”

Sam nodded once. “I had help.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Who helped you.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Mrs. Alden.”

Wes froze. “She… helped you.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “She likes projects.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “This town is… meddling.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Yes.”

They found a spot on the table and set their tins down. People swarmed around, trading, laughing, complimenting.

Wes kept his hands busy, organizing his tins like it was a form of emotional regulation.

Then Lila appeared.

Same bright eyes. Same friendly energy. Same ability to turn Wes’s bloodstream into panic.

She smiled. “Hi again.”

Wes’s spine tightened.

Sam was beside him, calm, not staring, not claiming. Just present.

Lila glanced between them, still kind, still not predatory. “I didn’t mean to put you on the spot the other night,” she said softly. “I’m new again. I’m… awkward.”

Wes blinked, caught by the sincerity.

Wes swallowed. “It’s fine.”

Lila’s smile warmed. “So. Are you… seeing someone.”

Wes’s heartbeat kicked.

His old instincts screamed: deflect, joke, flee, cinnamon.

But Wes felt Sam beside him. Quiet. Steady. Not demanding.

Wes inhaled.

Wes exhaled.

Then Wes said, clearly and calmly, “Yeah. I’m seeing someone.”

Lila’s smile didn’t falter. “Oh,” she said gently. “Okay. Good.”

Wes’s chest loosened a fraction, shocked.

Lila nodded once, sincere. “He’s lucky.”

Wes’s throat tightened, and he didn’t know what to do with that, so he did the only thing he could.

He glanced at Sam.

Sam met his eyes, warmth there, no pressure.

Lila followed the glance, then smiled like she’d just been given a simple answer to a simple question. “Cool,” she said. “Then I’ll trade you for those peppermint ones and leave you alone.”

Wes blinked. “You want peppermint.”

Lila grinned. “I have flaws.”

Wes huffed a laugh, startled.

They traded cookies. Lila winked once, friendly, and moved on without turning it into gossip.

Wes stood there for a moment, stunned by how… normal it had been.

Sam’s voice was low. “You okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes automatically, but he didn’t feel like he was bleeding inside. “Yes.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Good.”

Wes muttered, “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes’s mouth twitched, and then, because his body was apparently determined to keep learning, Wes did something tiny.

He let his hand brush Sam’s for half a second behind the cookie tins.

A private, small contact.

Sam’s fingers curled lightly, a quiet answer.

Wes exhaled, and for once, it didn’t feel like he was bracing for impact.

It felt like he was choosing something.

## Chapter 21: Day Seven, Snowman Triage, and Wes Learning to Give Back

By Day Seven, Wes had accepted that Tinsel Town was not a town.

It was an organism.

And during the holidays, it developed opinions, cravings, and emergencies the way a human body developed fevers.

Today’s emergency arrived at 8:12 a.m. in the form of Noel bursting into Candle & Crumb like a festive hurricane.

Wes didn’t look up from his dough. “If someone’s on fire, put them out. If the snowman lost another eye, I don’t care.”

Noel slapped both hands on the counter, breathless. “The snowman is missing his *nose*.”

Wes stared at him. “It’s a snowman.”

Noel’s face was solemn. “It’s the town snowman.”

Wes exhaled through his nose. “Still a snowman.”

Sam, seated at the small table with a mug of tea like he actually believed mornings could be peaceful, lifted his gaze. “What happened to the nose.”

Noel looked personally wounded by the universe. “A raccoon.”

Wes paused, hands in flour. “A raccoon stole a carrot.”

Noel nodded, eyes shining with outrage. “A bold criminal.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “That tracks.”

Wes glared at them both. “We are not doing snowman surgery.”

Noel leaned forward, pleading. “Wes. The snowman is the symbol of togetherness.”

Wes deadpanned. “The snowman is a pile of snow.”

Noel clasped his hands like he was praying. “Please.”

Wes turned toward Sam, low. “Tell him no.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Do you want me to tell him no.”

Wes blinked, annoyed by the question being reasonable. “Yes.”

Sam looked at Noel. Calm. “No.”

Noel held the gaze for three seconds, then pivoted smoothly. “Okay, but will you come help me anyway.”

Wes’s soul left his body.

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Maybe.”

Wes snapped, “SAM.”

Sam’s gaze slid to Wes, steady. “We can make it quick.”

Wes stared at him. “Why do you want to help with a snowman.”

Sam’s expression stayed calm, but there was a softness under it. “Because it matters to people.”

Wes’s throat tightened, because of course that was the answer.

Wes muttered, “Fine. But we’re doing it efficiently. Like a medical procedure.”

Noel beamed. “Bless you.”

Wes pointed a floury finger. “No. Don’t.”

Noel ignored him and practically floated out the door. “Meet at the square! Bring… carrot vibes!”

Wes watched Noel leave, then turned to Sam. “If I die in a snowman-related incident, you have to burn this town down.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Noted.”

Wes squinted. “That’s not a promise.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay. I promise not to burn the town down.”

Wes sighed. “Unhelpful.”

Sam stood, calm, and reached for his coat. “You still want me off duty today.”

Wes paused.

He’d said that yesterday without thinking. A tiny offer. A tiny care.

Wes swallowed. “After the snowman. Yes.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes, but his mouth twitched.

They left together.

---

Evergreen Square was bright with fresh snow and the kind of cold that made your nose sting the second you inhaled. The big town snowman stood near the tree, majestic and ridiculous, its face now disturbingly incomplete.

Noel stood beside it with Eben and Hugh like a crisis committee.

Eben held a replacement carrot in his gloved hand like evidence.

Hugh looked mournful. “He looks… unfinished.”

Wes approached, taking in the scene like a man evaluating a battlefield. “Okay. We attach the carrot. We leave.”

Noel nodded vigorously. “Yes. Simple.”

Hugh gasped. “Simple? This is art restoration.”

Wes ignored him and stepped up to the snowman.

The nose-hole was… worse than Wes expected. It wasn’t a clean missing-carrot situation. It looked like something had gnawed at the face.

Wes grimaced. “That raccoon was committed.”

Sam stepped closer, assessing. “We need to pack snow.”

Wes blinked. “Why are you good at this.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Snow is like… structural filler.”

Wes stared, then muttered, “Of course you’d know.”

Sam didn’t tease. He just crouched and started packing snow into the gap with slow, competent hands.

Wes found himself mirroring the motion, packing snow, smoothing it, shaping a proper base like he was icing a cake.

Noel watched, hands clasped, reverent. “Look at you two. Working in harmony.”

Wes snapped, “Noel.”

Noel made a zip-it gesture but couldn’t stop smiling.

Eben handed Sam the carrot like he was handing over an official document.

Sam took it, steady, then paused and looked at Wes. “You want to do it.”

Wes blinked. “Me.”

Sam nodded. “It’s your snowman.”

Wes’s chest tightened at the phrasing like it meant something more than it did.

Wes huffed. “Fine.”

He took the carrot and pressed it into place.

It stuck.

The snowman looked whole again. Silly and complete under the tree lights.

Noel exhaled dramatically like he’d been holding his breath for hours. “He lives.”

Hugh whispered, “A miracle.”

Eben said flatly, “It is a carrot.”

Noel turned, delighted. “Eben, you’re allergic to wonder.”

Eben walked away.

Noel looked back at Wes and Sam, eyes soft for once. “Thank you,” Noel said quietly. “I know this is ridiculous.”

Wes shrugged, trying not to feel anything. “It’s fine.”

Noel smiled. “It’s not fine. It’s kind.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He looked away fast.

Sam spoke, calm and neutral, saving Wes again. “We should go.”

Noel nodded. “Yes. Go. Be… normal people.”

Wes muttered, “We’re literally repairing snowmen.”

Noel beamed. “Normal!”

Wes and Sam turned away, walking back through the square.

After a few steps, Wes said quietly, “You did that thing again.”

Sam glanced at him. “What thing.”

Wes swallowed. “You gave me… the last step. The carrot.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “You like finishing things.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “That’s not…”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “It is.”

Wes exhaled through his nose, annoyed that Sam kept being correct.

They reached the bakery.

Inside, warmth wrapped around them. Safety.

Wes locked the door, then turned to Sam, hesitating like he didn’t know how to offer care without making it into a transaction.

Wes cleared his throat. “Okay. Off duty.”

Sam’s brows lifted. “Off duty.”

Wes nodded toward the little table. “Sit. I’ll make something. Food. Tea. Whatever you want.”

Sam watched him for a beat, expression soft. “You don’t have to.”

Wes glared, weak. “I want to.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Okay.”

Wes hissed, “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes turned away to hide how the warmth hit him, then started moving through the bakery like the act of feeding someone was the only love language he trusted.

He made grilled cheese on the small back griddle. Cut apples. Put out crackers. Poured tea. Added honey without asking, because he’d noticed Sam took it that way.

Sam sat at the table quietly, watching, not stopping him, not making it weird.

When Wes set the plate down, Sam’s voice was low. “You noticed.”

Wes froze. “What.”

Sam nodded toward the honey. “That.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “It’s… obvious.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “No. It’s care.”

Wes swallowed hard, then shoved his own plate into place and sat like he was annoyed at the chair.

They ate in quiet.

After a few bites, Sam said softly, “This is nice.”

Wes muttered, “It’s a grilled cheese.”

Sam’s gaze held him. “It’s you taking care of me.”

Wes’s throat tightened. He looked down at his food like it had suddenly become fascinating.

Wes forced out, quiet and rough, “I’m not good at that.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “You are.”

Wes exhaled, shaky. “Stop being… kind about it.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes huffed a laugh, then finally looked up at Sam.

Wes’s voice came low. “Tomorrow is Day Eight.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “What’s Day Eight.”

Wes grimaced. “Cookie exchange.”

Sam blinked. “We already did cookies.”

Wes deadpanned. “Noel thinks the town hasn’t reached peak cookie yet.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Of course.”

Wes leaned back in his chair, exhaustion settling in, but it wasn’t the sharp, lonely kind.

Wes watched Sam sip tea, calm and present, and realized something that made his chest ache in a softer way.

Wes wasn’t only being rescued anymore.

Wes blinked, caught by the sincerity.

Lila’s smile warmed. “So. Are you… seeing someone.”

Wes’s heartbeat kicked.

His old instincts screamed: deflect, joke, flee, cinnamon.

But Wes felt Sam beside him. Quiet. Steady. Not demanding.

## Chapter 23: Day Nine, Cocoa Crawl, and the First Hint of an End Date

Day Nine’s event sounded harmless on the flyer.

**COCOA CRAWL: VISIT LOCAL STOPS, COLLECT STAMPS, WIN PRIZES.**

In reality, it was an organized migration of sugar-hyped citizens moving through town like a cheerful herd.

Wes stood behind the portable Cocoa Crawl table outside Candle & Crumb, stamping little cards with a grim focus that suggested he was auditing taxes.

Sam stood beside him, steady, gloved hands resting on the table edge, scanning the crowd with the calm of a man who’d accepted that small towns were a contact sport.

Noel had stationed himself three feet away wearing a scarf the size of a blanket, “helping” by flirting with everyone.

Eben was across the street directing traffic like the holiday season was a threat he’d personally vowed to contain.

Hugh had created a “cocoa playlist” and was playing it from a speaker that was definitely not approved for outdoor use.

Wes stamped another card and muttered, “This is a cult.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “It’s a game.”

Wes glanced at him. “It’s a cult with marshmallows.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

A couple approached, laughing, and held out their stamp cards.

“Two peppermint mochas,” the woman said, delighted. “And two stamps, please.”

Wes stamped with mechanical precision. “Congratulations. You’re closer to winning a basket of artisanal jams and emotional closure.”

The man laughed. “Wes Candle never misses.”

Sam’s gaze flicked to Wes, warm, like he enjoyed the bluntness.

The couple wandered off, sipping cocoa and leaning into each other.

Wes watched them for half a second too long.

Sam’s voice went low, gentle. “You okay.”

Wes’s shoulders tightened. “Stop asking.”

Sam’s eyes stayed steady. “Answer anyway.”

Wes exhaled, annoyed at himself. “I’m fine.”

Sam didn’t challenge it. He just nodded once and stayed.

That was his whole thing: **stay**.

An hour in, the crowd shifted and a new wave rolled up the street, laughing, stamping, comparing cocoa flavors like it was a competitive sport.

Then Wes felt it.

A change in the air.

Sam’s posture tightened slightly, subtle enough most people wouldn’t notice.

Wes noticed because Wes noticed everything.

A man in a dark uniform jacket approached, taller than Sam, familiar in the way of someone who belonged to Sam’s world.

He stopped near the table and smiled like he’d already decided he was going to be annoying.

“Rook,” the man said.

Sam’s voice stayed even. “Mason.”

Wes’s brain immediately filed it: name, tone, history.

Mason’s gaze slid to Wes. “And you are.”

Wes kept his stamping hand steady. “Wes. Baker. Local menace.”

Mason laughed. “Aren’t you charming.”

Sam’s eyes narrowed a fraction. “What are you doing here.”

Mason lifted a cocoa stamp card like it was evidence. “Cocoa crawl. I’m on a quick check-in. Chief wanted eyes on the crowd. Holiday events attract… idiots.”

Wes muttered, “True.”

Mason’s eyes flicked back to Wes, amused. “You always this blunt.”

Wes stamped another card. “Only when I’m breathing.”

Mason chuckled, then turned back to Sam. “Anyway. Your detail ends soon.”

Wes’s hand paused mid-stamp.

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “I know.”

Mason’s grin sharpened like he’d enjoyed watching the effect. “Couple more days. Then you’re back to regular rotation. Maybe even out of town for a bit. Depends.”

Wes’s chest tightened hard enough it almost hurt.

Sam’s gaze flicked to Wes for half a second, then back to Mason. “Not decided yet.”

Mason nodded like he didn’t care either way. “Just giving you the heads up.”

Mason’s eyes slid to Wes again, lingering. “Good luck with the crawl.”

Wes gave him a polite smile that contained exactly zero warmth. “Thanks.”

Mason wandered off into the crowd, already forgotten by everyone else.

Wes couldn’t forget.

Sam stayed still beside him, steadying his voice before he said anything.

Sam’s tone was low, only for Wes. “Hey.”

Wes kept stamping like his life depended on it. “Don’t.”

Sam didn’t push. “Okay.”

Wes hated that word and also needed it.

They worked in silence for a few minutes, the crowd flowing, the stamps thudding onto cards like a heartbeat.

Finally, when the next lull hit, Wes’s voice came out tight. “Your detail ends soon.”

Sam nodded once. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “And then you might… leave.”

Sam’s gaze held his, steady. “I might get reassigned for a week or two. Or I might not.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “You didn’t tell me.”

Sam’s voice stayed gentle. “You didn’t ask.”

Wes flinched, because that was fair, and he hated fairness.

Sam added softly, “I wasn’t hiding it. I just didn’t want to drop it on you in the middle of… everything.”

Wes’s jaw clenched. “It still feels like a drop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes’s shoulders rose with a sharp inhale. “Stop.”

Sam’s voice went quieter. “Wes. Look at me.”

Wes didn’t want to.

Wes did anyway.

Sam’s gaze was steady, no pity, no pressure. “If I leave town for work, it doesn’t mean I disappear. It doesn’t mean I’m done.”

Wes swallowed hard. “You can’t promise that.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “I can promise I’ll tell you what’s happening. No vanishing. No silence.”

Wes’s chest hurt. “Why do you keep saying the exact things I don’t know how to ask for.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, soft. “Practice.”

Wes huffed a shaky laugh that sounded like relief trying to pretend it wasn’t.

A new group approached with stamp cards, saving Wes from further emotional competence.

Wes stamped their cards, gave them cocoa, smiled like a professional.

But inside, a quiet clock had started ticking.

---

## Chapter 24: Day Ten, the Small Ask, and Wes Choosing the Hard Kind of Brave

Day Ten’s event was a “Holiday Market Setup,” which meant Noel had convinced half the town to haul folding tables through snow while pretending it was fun.

Wes arrived early with a thermos of coffee and the expression of a man reporting for duty.

Sam arrived beside him, steady, carrying an extra box of extension cords because he’d apparently decided Wes wasn’t allowed to be the only adult.

Noel was already there, directing volunteers like a conductor.

Eben was there too, somehow already tired.

Hugh had brought banners.

Wes eyed the banners. “Why do they sparkle.”

Hugh clutched his heart. “Because hope sparkles.”

Eben’s voice was flat. “Because Hugh is a hazard.”

Noel spotted Wes and Sam and immediately tried to assign them to the most “romantic” tasks available.

“Great!” Noel announced. “You two can string lights on the stall frames. Very… efficient.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Noel.”

Noel smiled sweetly. “Logistics.”

Eben said without looking up, “It is, unfortunately, logistics.”

Wes muttered, “I hate all of you.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes glared. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

They worked.

Wes held the ladder. Sam climbed and looped lights along the frame with calm precision, fingers fast even in gloves.

Every so often, Sam glanced down and Wes’s stomach did the annoying flip again.

Not panic. Not fear.

Just… **want**.

When they finished the last frame, Sam climbed down and stepped close, still in work-mode.

Wes’s hand came up automatically, steadying Sam’s elbow as he landed.

Their gloves brushed.

Wes didn’t yank his hand away.

Sam’s gaze flicked to the contact, then to Wes’s face, softening.

Wes’s throat tightened.

The clock in his chest ticked.

Wes cleared his throat. “After this… can we talk.”

Sam’s gaze steadied. “Yeah. Where.”

Wes hesitated, then said the thing that was actually hard. “My place.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay.”

Wes’s mouth twitched. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’m not teasing.”

Wes swallowed. “Good.”

They finished the setup, helped Noel wrangle a pile of tablecloths, saved Hugh from attempting to tape a banner directly to a historic lamppost, and finally escaped.

Wes walked fast back to the bakery apartment, heart pounding with the stupidest fear: **if I ask for too much, it breaks.**

Inside, warmth wrapped around them.

Wes locked the door, then stood there for a beat like he’d forgotten what people did next.

Sam waited, calm, giving space.

Wes exhaled. “Okay. So.”

Sam’s voice was low. “So.”

Wes paced two steps, then stopped, then turned. “That guy. Mason.”

Sam nodded. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed hard. “You might leave town.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “For work, maybe. Temporarily.”

Wes’s jaw clenched. “Temporarily still counts.”

Sam didn’t argue. “It does.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “I don’t do… waiting.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Tell me what you need.”

Wes blinked, caught. “I don’t know.”

Sam nodded once, like that was allowed. “Okay. Then we figure it out.”

Wes’s chest ached. He forced the truth out anyway, rough and unpolished. “I need to know you’re not going to just… stop showing up.”

Sam’s gaze didn’t waver. “I won’t.”

Wes’s breath hitched. “You can’t promise the schedule.”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “I can promise communication. I can promise I won’t punish you with silence. And I can promise… if I leave town, I’m coming back.”

Wes swallowed hard.

Sam added, softer, “And if you want, you can come with me sometimes. When it makes sense. When you want.”

Wes froze.

That offer landed like a door cracking open into a life Wes hadn’t let himself imagine.

Wes stared. “I can’t just… leave the bakery.”

Sam’s expression stayed gentle. “Not forever. Not for a dramatic rom-com montage. But for a weekend. For a day. For a drive.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “I don’t know how to do that.”

Sam’s voice was low. “Then I’ll teach you.”

Wes’s eyes stung, annoying and immediate.

Wes looked down, jaw tight. “I hate that you make this sound possible.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, soft. “Okay.”

Wes glared, half-hearted. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes exhaled a laugh that sounded like surrender.

Then Wes did the hard thing.

Wes said, quietly, “If you do get reassigned… I want a plan.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay. A plan.”

Wes swallowed. “Calls. Texts. Something predictable.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Done.”

Wes’s breath hitched. “And… I want to see you before you go. If you go.”

Sam’s voice was soft. “Yes.”

Wes’s throat tightened again. “And when you come back… I don’t want to start over.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “We won’t.”

Wes blinked hard, like he could hold back the stupid sting.

Wes whispered, almost embarrassed by his own want, “Stay tonight.”

Sam’s answer was immediate. “Yes.”

Wes nodded once, like that was all he could handle.

Then he stepped in and kissed Sam, slow and grounding, as if his body needed proof more than his mind did.

Sam returned it gently, one hand at Wes’s waist, steady.

Sam broke the kiss just enough to murmur, “Still okay.”

Wes exhaled. “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Good.”

Wes pressed his forehead to Sam’s for a beat and whispered, “I’m seeing you.”

Sam’s voice was quiet and sure. “I’m seeing you too.”

And the words didn’t feel like a trap.

They felt like a plan.

**[STOP WRITING]**



## Chapter 25: Day Eleven, Market Day, and the Plan That Holds

Day Eleven arrived with the holiday market in full swing and the town acting like commerce was a spiritual practice.

Evergreen Square was lined with stalls: handmade ornaments, knitted scarves, jars of jam, carved wooden toys, and one suspicious booth Hugh claimed was “avant-garde wreath theory.”

Wes ran the Candle & Crumb stall with the grim competence of a man protecting the realm. Cookies stacked. Labels straight. Cash box guarded like it contained state secrets.

Sam stood nearby, not looming, just… present. Helping when asked. Carrying boxes. Being the kind of steady that made Wes’s nervous system unclench without permission.

Noel floated through the market like a benevolent menace, collecting donations and compliments.

Eben directed foot traffic with the intensity of airport security.

Hugh was, unfortunately, thriving.

Wes handed a bag of ginger snaps to a customer, then glanced sideways at Sam. “You’re doing that thing again.”

Sam’s brows lifted. “What thing.”

Wes nodded toward the crowd. “Standing close enough to help. Far enough to not make it… a scene.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You asked for slow.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Don’t say it like I’m reasonable.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “You are.”

Wes snorted and turned back to the register, because admitting he liked that would be emotionally irresponsible.

A lull hit around mid-afternoon.

Noel was busy charming a donor. Eben was confiscating Hugh’s glitter tape. The crowd thinned to a manageable hum.

Wes breathed out, and for the first time all week, he let himself *pause*.

Sam leaned in slightly, voice low. “You want to take five.”

Wes blinked. “I can’t just… take five.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “You can. I’ll run the stall.”

Wes stared like Sam had offered to lift a car. “You don’t know the prices.”

Sam nodded once. “Tell me two prices. I’ll improvise the rest.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “This is how you get audited.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes groaned. “Stop saying okay like you’re a monk.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Take five.”

Wes hesitated. Then he did the wildest thing.

He stepped back from the stall.

Not far. Just to the side, behind a little display of pine boughs and lanterns where he could breathe without eyes on him.

Sam slid into place behind the table like he belonged there.

A customer approached. Sam gave a calm smile and somehow managed to be polite without being syrupy, which was frankly unfair.

Wes watched for half a minute, chest tight, waiting for his body to freak out.

It didn’t.

It settled.

When Wes stepped back to the stall, Sam’s gaze flicked to him. “Better.”

Wes muttered, “Slightly.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Good.”

Wes glared. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes exhaled, then said quietly, “We should talk about the plan again.”

Sam’s expression softened. “Okay. Tonight.”

Wes swallowed. “Before the Lantern Walk.”

Sam nodded. “Before.”

Wes’s throat tightened. A plan. A timeline. Predictable contact.

Not romance-movie grand.

Just… stable.

The market continued, and the town kept doing its ridiculous holiday thing.

Wes kept selling cookies.

Sam kept staying.

And for once, the stability didn’t feel like it was about to vanish the second Wes looked at it.

## Chapter 26: Day Twelve, The Lantern Walk, and the Choice That’s Visible but Not Loud

Night fell early, as it always did in December, and Tinsel Town turned on its lights like a decision.

The lantern path glowed. The tree shimmered. The square filled with bundled-up townspeople holding paper cups of cocoa like it was sacred.

Wes stood at the edge of the crowd, hands in his coat pockets, scanning for hazards out of habit.

Sam stood beside him, shoulder close enough to brush, not quite touching.

Noel bounced nearby in a scarf that could qualify as a duvet, microphone in hand because Noel believed the human voice was meant to fill all silence.

“Welcome,” Noel announced, softer tonight, “to the Lantern Walk. Take someone you like. Take someone you love. Take someone you just met. Walk together. Breathe together. Try not to slip on the icy patch by the third lantern, because Hugh refuses to salt ‘for aesthetic reasons.’”

Hugh gasped. “It ruins the mood.”

Eben muttered, “Salt saves lives.”

Wes snorted under his breath.

Sam’s gaze flicked to him, warm.

Noel’s eyes scanned the crowd and landed, predictably, on Wes and Sam.

Noel’s smile softened, almost gentle.

Wes braced for sabotage.

Noel just nodded once, like a silent *good*, then turned back to the mic. “Okay. Pairs whenever you’re ready.”

The crowd began to move.

Couples, friends, families. A slow, glowing river down the path.

Wes didn’t move immediately.

Sam stayed still too, waiting.

Wes’s throat tightened. The old fear tried to flare: *If I step forward, everyone will see. If everyone sees, it becomes a story. If it becomes a story, it can get taken.*

Wes inhaled.

He exhaled.

Then he looked at Sam.

“Hand,” Wes said, barely audible, like he was ordering a pastry.

Sam didn’t smile. Didn’t tease. Just lifted his gloved hand a little, offering.

Wes took it.

The contact was warm even through gloves. A steady tether.

Wes’s chest hurt in the way a muscle hurt when it finally got used.

They stepped forward together and joined the slow river of people.

Noel didn’t clap.

Hugh didn’t scream.

Eben didn’t die of emotion.

The town just… let it be.

The lanterns glowed around them like the world had decided to be kind.

Halfway down the path, they reached the arch again. The one with pine boughs and lights.

The mistletoe still hung there, unrepentant.

Wes felt his body tense, instinct wanting to pivot.

Sam’s voice went low, only for him. “We can walk past.”

Wes swallowed.

He thought of the plan they’d made. Calls. Texts. No disappearing. Coming back.

He thought of Sam standing behind his stall while Wes took five minutes to breathe.

He thought of how “seeing him” hadn’t exploded the town into gossip, it had just… existed.

Wes tightened his grip on Sam’s hand and said, quiet and rough, “Not for them.”

Sam’s gaze held his, steady. “For you.”

Wes’s heart hammered.

Wes leaned in and kissed Sam once under the arch.

Quick. Private in the way a small thing could be private even in public.

A kiss that said: *I’m choosing this.* Not as a performance. Not as a headline. As a fact.

When Wes pulled back, Sam’s eyes were warm, almost stunned.

Sam’s voice was low. “Still okay.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Yes.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, soft. “Good.”

They kept walking.

And the town kept walking.

And the world didn’t end.

It just glowed.

## Chapter 27: The Night After, and the Happily-For-Now That Doesn’t Feel Like a Lie

Back at Candle & Crumb, Wes locked the door and leaned his forehead against the wood for a second, breathing like he’d run a marathon.

Sam stood a few feet away, quiet, letting Wes come down on his own terms.

Wes turned, eyes bright with something he still didn’t know how to hold.

“That was…” Wes started.

Sam waited, steady.

Wes swallowed. “A lot.”

Sam’s voice was gentle. “Good a lot or too much.”

Wes exhaled, shaky. “Good.”

Sam’s shoulders loosened slightly, like he’d been holding his breath too.

Wes paced two steps, then stopped like his body couldn’t decide whether to flee or stay.

Wes looked at Sam. “If you get reassigned…”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “I’ll tell you. We’ll use the plan.”

Wes nodded once. “And if I freak out…”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You will.”

Wes glared. “Rude.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Accurate.”

Wes huffed a laugh, then stepped closer, slow. “And you’ll still… come back.”

Sam’s voice was calm and sure. “Yes.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Okay.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “Okay.”

Wes stared for a beat, then leaned in and kissed Sam again. Longer this time. Not rushed. Not desperate.

When Sam’s hands came up, they were gentle, asking without words.

Wes answered by staying.

They moved upstairs with the quiet inevitability of two people who’d finally stopped pretending this was temporary.

In the bedroom, they took their time. Kissing. Holding. Warmth and closeness that didn’t need narration to prove anything.

When it became more than kissing, it stayed private, slow, and chosen, the way Wes needed.

Afterward, Wes lay curled against Sam, breathing steady, fingers lightly gripping Sam’s shirt like he was anchoring himself to something real.

Sam’s arm held him, quiet and solid.

Wes whispered, half embarrassed, “You’re still here.”

Sam’s voice was low. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “Good.”

Sam’s mouth brushed Wes’s hair, almost a kiss. “Good.”

Wes closed his eyes and let the warmth settle in his chest like it belonged there.

Not forever. Not with guarantees carved into stone.

But for now. For this winter. For this strange little town with its lanterns and its meddling and its ridiculous snowman emergencies.

For a plan.

For a man who stayed.

Wes exhaled, finally letting his body rest.

And for the first time in a long time, “happily for now” didn’t feel like a lie.

**[STOP WRITING]**



## Chapter 28: The Morning After the Lantern Walk

Wes woke up to quiet.

Not the brittle, lonely quiet he used to live in. Not the “no one is here and you should be productive about it” quiet.

This was… soft.

Snow-light filtered through the curtains. The bakery below was still asleep. The town outside was probably still hungover on cocoa and carols.

Sam was beside him, warm and solid, breathing slow.

Wes lay still for a minute, waiting for his brain to do its usual thing. The sabotage. The list. The compulsion to sprint downstairs and start proofing dough just to prove he was functional.

The list tried.

But it didn’t win.

Wes turned his head slightly and watched Sam sleep, the calm of it making something in Wes’s chest loosen in a way that felt unfamiliar.

Sam’s eyes opened after a minute, slow.

He blinked once, then looked at Wes like it was normal to wake up and find someone you wanted still there.

“Morning,” Sam murmured.

Wes swallowed. “Morning.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, sleepy. “Still okay.”

Wes groaned into the pillow. “You’re obsessed.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Answer anyway.”

Wes exhaled. “Yeah. I’m okay.”

Sam’s shoulders loosened, like he’d been waiting for the confirmation even though he already knew. “Good.”

Wes stared at him, caught off guard by how much the word *good* landed.

Wes muttered, “Don’t be pleased.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “I am pleased.”

Wes’s throat tightened. Again.

He rolled onto his side, closer, and pressed his forehead against Sam’s for a beat because apparently that was a thing he did now instead of running.

Wes whispered, rough, “We kissed under the arch.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady, warm. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “That was… public.”

Sam didn’t tease. “It was small.”

Wes’s breath shuddered. “It felt big.”

Sam’s voice was quiet. “To you.”

Wes nodded once, not trusting his mouth.

Sam’s hand slid up to the back of Wes’s neck, thumb resting there like an anchor. “Do you regret it.”

Wes blinked hard. “No.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Good.”

Wes huffed. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes stared at him for a second, then admitted the second truth, quieter. “I’m scared it means you’ll leave and it’ll hurt more.”

Sam didn’t flinch.

Sam didn’t give a big speech.

He just said, steady and plain, “If it hurts more, it’s because it mattered.”

Wes’s eyes stung. He hated it. He loved it.

Wes swallowed and shoved his face into Sam’s shoulder like that solved anything.

Sam’s arm tightened around him, gentle.

After a beat, Sam murmured, “We can stay in bed a little.”

Wes hesitated, then let himself say it. “Yeah.”

Sam’s breath warmed Wes’s hair. “Okay.”

Wes muttered, muffled, “Stop saying okay.”

Sam’s mouth tipped against his hair. “No.”

And Wes stayed.

---

## Chapter 29: The Reassignment Call

The call came at noon, because of course it did.

Wes was downstairs prepping a new batch of dough, pretending he wasn’t still warm from the morning. Sam was at the table with coffee and a folded paper map of town that he absolutely did not need, because Sam was the kind of person who could make “prepared” look like a personality trait.

Sam’s phone buzzed.

Wes felt it in his body before Sam even moved.

Sam glanced at the screen, expression tightening just a fraction. “It’s the station.”

Wes’s hands stilled.

His brain lit up like a warning panel. *Here it is. Here it is. Here it is.*

Sam stood, calm, and walked a few steps away to take the call, voice low.

Wes kept his eyes on the dough like it had suddenly become a life-or-death situation.

He heard fragments.

“…yeah.”

“…understood.”

“…two weeks.”

Wes’s stomach dropped hard enough he almost felt sick.

Sam ended the call and came back slowly, not rushing, not bracing for impact like Wes was a bomb.

Wes forced his hands to keep moving, kneading like he could knead the fear out of his bloodstream.

Sam stopped at the edge of the prep counter. “Hey.”

Wes didn’t look up. “Don’t.”

Sam’s voice stayed gentle. “Okay. But I’m telling you.”

Wes swallowed hard. “Two weeks.”

Sam nodded. “Two weeks. Starting after tomorrow.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “Out of town.”

Sam nodded again. “Out of town.”

Wes’s mouth went dry. “You’re leaving.”

Sam’s gaze held him. “For work. And I’m coming back.”

Wes’s breath hitched. The old instincts screamed at him to get angry, to get cold, to get ahead of the hurt by pretending he didn’t care.

Instead, Wes heard himself say, rough, “Plan.”

Sam’s shoulders eased a fraction, like the word was a bridge. “Plan.”

Wes finally looked up, eyes bright in a way he hated. “You call. You text. Predictable.”

Sam nodded. “Yes.”

Wes’s voice went sharper, because fear always tried to disguise itself as control. “If something changes, you tell me. Immediately.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Yes.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “No disappearing.”

Sam’s voice was calm and sure. “No disappearing.”

Wes swallowed hard, then forced the last part out, quiet and raw. “And I want to see you before you go.”

Sam’s expression softened. “You will.”

Wes stared at him for a beat, chest heaving like he’d run a mile.

Sam stepped closer, slow. “Do you want me to stay tonight.”

Wes’s laugh came out sharp and bitter, because his brain was trying to be cruel for protection. “Obviously.”

Sam didn’t flinch at the tone. “Okay.”

Wes squeezed his eyes shut for a second, then opened them again, jaw tight. “I’m not mad at you.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “I know.”

Wes swallowed. “I’m mad at… timing.”

Sam nodded. “That’s fair.”

Wes’s hands were shaking. He set the dough down and scrubbed his palms on his apron like that could clean off the feeling.

Sam watched him for a beat, then said softly, “Come here.”

Wes’s reflex was to say no.

Wes didn’t.

He walked around the counter and stopped in front of Sam like he was stepping into weather he wasn’t sure he could handle.

Sam lifted a hand, not touching yet. “Okay if I hold you.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Yes.”

Sam pulled him in, steady and warm, arms wrapping around Wes like it was the most normal thing in the world to hold someone who was trying not to fall apart.

Wes pressed his forehead to Sam’s shoulder and breathed.

Sam’s voice was low near his ear. “We’re not starting over.”

Wes’s breath hitched. “Promise.”

Sam’s answer was immediate. “Promise.”

Wes’s body sagged a fraction, like it had been waiting for that.

He whispered, muffled, “I hate that this hurts.”

Sam’s hand rested at the back of his neck, gentle. “It hurts because you’re doing the brave thing. You’re staying in it.”

Wes exhaled shakily. “Don’t make it sound noble.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, quiet warmth. “Okay. Then it’s just real.”

Wes nodded once into Sam’s shoulder.

Real.

Fine.

Manageable.

They stood there for a moment, the bakery warm around them, the town outside continuing its ridiculous winter life.

And Wes didn’t bolt.

---

## Chapter 30: The Last Festival Night

The final night of the festival wasn’t a big setpiece.

It was smaller. Softer. Like Tinsel Town had spent its fireworks and decided to end with lanterns instead.

Noel held a short “thank you” speech in the square, shockingly contained. Eben looked like he’d personally supervised every word.

Hugh wore a velvet coat and tried to make “one last magical flourish” happen with confetti. Eben confiscated the confetti.

The town laughed. The tree glowed. People hugged. People promised to see each other soon, even though they lived ten minutes apart.

Wes stood near the edge of it all with Sam, hands in his pockets, shoulders not as tight as they used to be.

Noel wandered over, cheeks pink from cold and effort.

He looked at Wes and Sam for a beat, expression softer than usual. “You did good,” Noel said quietly.

Wes squinted. “Don’t start.”

Noel lifted both hands. “Not starting. Just… saying.”

Wes’s throat tightened, and he hated Noel for being sincere.

Noel’s gaze flicked to Sam. “Take care of him.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “I will.”

Wes bristled automatically. “I’m right here.”

Noel smiled. “I know.”

Eben appeared beside Noel like a shadow with opinions. “Stop hovering.”

Noel gasped. “I’m blessing them.”

Eben’s gaze slid to Wes, then Sam, then away. “Don’t make it weird.”

Wes muttered, “Thank you.”

Eben blinked like he wasn’t used to gratitude, then nodded once and walked off.

Noel watched Eben go, eyes softening, then looked back at Wes. “Text me,” Noel said suddenly.

Wes frowned. “Why.”

Noel’s mouth tipped. “Because you’re going to spiral when he leaves and I’m going to bully you into eating.”

Wes stared. “You can’t just say that.”

Noel grinned. “I can and I did.”

Wes exhaled, half annoyed, half… grateful, which was disgusting. “Fine.”

Noel beamed like he’d won something and wandered off to harass another volunteer into accepting a hug.

Wes turned slightly toward Sam, voice low. “I’m not going to be normal about this.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, warm. “I know.”

Wes swallowed. “But I’m not going to be terrible either.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “That’s huge.”

Wes rolled his eyes. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes stood there for a beat, watching the town glow, feeling the clock tick in his chest.

Then Wes did it.

Wes reached out and took Sam’s hand. No hiding behind a table. No pretending it was accidental.

Just… choice.

Sam’s fingers curled around his, steady and warm even through gloves.

Wes didn’t look around to see who noticed.

He didn’t need to.

He leaned in slightly, voice rough and private. “When you’re gone… call me every night.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Real okay.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Real okay.”

Wes swallowed, then added the second ask, quieter. “And when you come back… come straight here.”

Sam’s gaze held him like a promise. “I will.”

Wes nodded once, breathing hard like he’d run again.

Sam lifted Wes’s gloved hand and pressed a brief kiss to his knuckles. Small. Quick. For Wes. Not for the town.

Wes’s chest ached, warm and sharp.

He whispered, “Still okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed, pleased at the theft of his line. “Yes.”

Wes’s mouth twitched. “Good.”

They stayed until the lights dimmed and the crowd thinned.

Then they walked home together through snow and lantern glow, hand in hand like it was allowed.

Like it could be real even when it wasn’t forever.

And Wes, for once, let “real” be enough.

**[STOP WRITING]**


## Chapter 31: The Goodbye That Isn’t a Breakup

The morning Sam left, the bakery woke up like it was trying to pretend this was normal.

The ovens hummed. The kettles clicked. The snow outside held the street in soft silence.

Wes moved through the prep space with sharp, efficient hands. Coffee. Toast. A small paper bag of pastries he absolutely did not need to send, because Sam could eat literally anywhere, but Wes needed **something** to do with his hands.

Sam stood by the small table, coat on, duffel at his feet, watching Wes without hovering.

Wes kept his back turned for a full minute longer than necessary.

Finally, Sam said quietly, “Wes.”

Wes froze, then exhaled. “Don’t.”

Sam’s voice stayed steady. “I’m leaving in ten.”

Wes nodded once like he’d been told the weather.

He turned, shoved the pastry bag toward Sam. “Food. You’ll forget.”

Sam took it gently. “Thanks.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Don’t make it a thing.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “You made it a thing.”

Wes glared, but it had no bite. “Shut up.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes hard enough to qualify as cardio, then stepped closer anyway.

They stood in the middle of the bakery, warm air and sugar and wood around them like a familiar blanket.

Wes swallowed. “The plan.”

Sam nodded. “The plan.”

Wes said it like a checklist because that was the only way his brain could hold it. “Text when you arrive. Call every night. If anything changes, you tell me immediately.”

Sam’s gaze didn’t waver. “Yes.”

Wes’s voice went tighter. “And you come back.”

Sam’s answer was immediate. “I come back.”

Wes’s breath hitched, and he hated himself for it.

Sam waited a beat, then asked quietly, “Do you want a goodbye kiss.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. He tried for sarcasm and failed. “Obviously.”

Sam stepped in slowly, giving Wes time to bolt.

Wes didn’t bolt.

Wes kissed him. Not rushed. Not desperate. A steady, chosen kiss that made Wes’s chest ache with warmth and fear tangled together.

When Sam pulled back, his eyes stayed on Wes’s like he was anchoring the moment in memory.

“Still okay,” Sam murmured.

Wes swallowed. “No.”

Sam’s expression softened, calm. “Okay. What do you need.”

Wes stared at him, throat tight, then forced it out, low and raw. “Just… don’t make me guess.”

Sam nodded. “You won’t have to.”

Wes exhaled, shaky. “Good.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Good.”

Sam reached up, thumb brushing Wes’s cheek once, quick and gentle.

Wes flinched like it meant too much.

It did.

Sam’s voice was low. “I’ll call tonight.”

Wes nodded once, jaw tight. “Tonight.”

Sam picked up his duffel.

Wes followed him to the front door like he couldn’t not.

Sam paused on the threshold. Looked back. “You’ll eat.”

Wes snapped, “Yes.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Lie.”

Wes glared. “Noel will bully me.”

Sam nodded, satisfied. “Good.”

Wes swallowed hard. “Go.”

Sam’s gaze held him one last second, soft and steady. “I’m coming back.”

Wes couldn’t trust his voice, so he just nodded.

Sam stepped out into the cold.

Wes watched him go until the street swallowed him.

Then Wes locked the door and pressed his forehead against the wood like it was the only thing keeping him upright.

---

## Chapter 32: The First Night

Wes made it through the day by pure spite.

He baked. He cleaned. He organized a shelf that didn’t need organizing. He rearranged cookie tins by flavor, by size, by “how much emotional collapse they could prevent.”

Noel stopped by at exactly 6:04 p.m. with a casserole like a threat.

Wes stared at it. “What is that.”

Noel smiled sweetly. “Food. You’re going to eat it.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “I have food.”

Noel walked past him into the bakery like he owned it. “You have *ingredients*. Not the same thing.”

Eben followed, silent as a judgment.

Wes’s mouth tightened. “Traitor.”

Noel set the casserole on the counter. “Listen,” Noel said, softer now, “you did good. He left. You didn’t implode. That’s growth.”

Wes muttered, “He left today.”

Noel nodded. “Yes. And you are upright.”

Wes glared. “Barely.”

Noel pointed at him. “Still counts.”

Eben, from the doorway, said flatly, “Eat.”

Wes blinked at Eben. “You’re also here.”

Eben’s gaze was impassive. “Noel is dramatic. Someone must supervise.”

Noel gasped. “I’m supportive.”

Eben stared at him until Noel stopped talking.

Wes exhaled a laugh he didn’t fully mean, then slumped onto a chair like he’d run a marathon.

Noel served him a portion like a nurse. Wes ate because he was too tired to fight.

Eben stayed for exactly twelve minutes, then stood. “He will call.”

Wes’s chest tightened. “I know.”

Eben nodded once, like that was settled, and left without another word.

Noel lingered, eyes softer than usual. “Text me if you start spiraling,” Noel said, quiet.

Wes rolled his eyes. “Get out.”

Noel smiled. “Love you too,” and left.

The bakery went quiet again.

At 9:00 p.m. on the dot, Wes’s phone rang.

Wes stared at it like it was a live wire.

He answered on the second ring because he was not going to be pathetic about this, absolutely not.

Sam’s voice came through, low and steady. “Hey.”

Wes’s throat tightened instantly. “Hey.”

Sam paused like he was listening for damage. “You okay.”

Wes exhaled. “No.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Okay. Tell me.”

Wes swallowed hard. “It’s… quiet.”

Sam’s tone softened. “Yeah.”

Wes stared at the darkened prep space, lights low, ovens off. “It’s stupid.”

Sam’s voice was gentle. “It’s not stupid.”

Wes’s mouth tightened. “Did you arrive.”

Sam answered steadily, like a checklist because he knew Wes liked those. “Arrived. Checked in. Hotel’s fine. I ate.”

Wes blinked. “You ate.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, audible in his voice. “I ate the pastries.”

Wes’s chest ached, warm. “Good.”

Sam’s voice went lower. “I miss you.”

Wes froze.

He hated how fast his eyes stung.

Wes forced it out anyway, rough and honest. “I miss you too.”

Sam didn’t make a big deal of it. He just let it sit there like a truth that didn’t need defending.

They talked for twenty minutes about nothing: the drive, the snow, the shift schedule, a terrible diner Sam had passed, the raccoon Noel was now apparently “tracking.”

And when Wes’s voice finally started to steady, Sam said quietly, “Same time tomorrow.”

Wes swallowed. “Same time.”

Sam’s tone warmed. “Still okay.”

Wes sighed into the phone, exhausted. “I’m… better.”

Sam’s voice was soft. “Good.”

Wes muttered, “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes closed his eyes and let himself smile, small and tired.

“Goodnight,” Wes said.

“Goodnight,” Sam answered. “I’m coming back.”

Wes whispered, barely, “I know.”

The call ended.

Wes sat in the quiet for another minute.

Then he stood up, turned off the remaining lights, and went upstairs.

Not because he was fine.

Because he was still here.

---

## Chapter 33: Two Weeks Later

The day Sam came back, Tinsel Town was thawing.

Not fully. Winter still had its claws in the sidewalks. But the sun was brighter, the snow softer, the air less sharp.

Wes was downstairs pretending to be normal, which meant he’d baked twice as much as necessary and cleaned every surface like it had personally offended him.

Noel had texted him that morning: **HE’S COMING. DO NOT PANIC-BAKE.**

Wes had replied: **I’M NOT.**

Noel had replied: **LIE.**

At 4:17 p.m., the bell over the bakery door chimed.

Wes’s whole body went still.

He didn’t move for one full second, like his brain needed to confirm reality.

Then he turned.

Sam stood in the doorway, coat dusted with cold, duffel in hand, eyes steady and soft like he’d been walking toward this moment the whole drive.

Wes’s throat tightened so hard it almost hurt.

Sam’s voice was quiet. “Hey.”

Wes’s voice came out rough. “Hey.”

Sam stepped inside and set his duffel down. He didn’t rush forward. He didn’t demand anything.

He just looked at Wes like Wes was real.

Wes crossed the space between them in three strides and grabbed Sam’s coat with both hands like he needed to anchor himself to something solid.

Wes kissed him before he could talk himself out of it.

Sam kissed back immediately, warm and steady, hands coming up to hold Wes like he’d been doing it in his head for two weeks.

When Wes pulled back, he was breathing hard like he’d run again.

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Still okay.”

Wes huffed a shaky laugh. “Yes.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Good.”

Wes swallowed, gaze sharp because he needed one last confirmation. “You came straight here.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “I said I would.”

Wes’s chest ached, warm and relieved and furious at how much he’d needed that.

Wes muttered, “I hate that I need you.”

Sam’s expression softened. “You don’t need me.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Don’t you dare.”

Sam’s mouth tipped, gentle. “Okay. You want me. And I want you.”

Wes stared at him, throat tight, then finally exhaled like his body remembered how to breathe.

Wes nodded toward the back, voice rough. “Upstairs.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes through the sting. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes grabbed Sam’s hand and pulled him toward the stairs like he wasn’t letting the world take him away again.

And this time, when the door closed behind them, it didn’t feel like hiding.

It felt like coming home.

**[STOP WRITING]**



You’re near the **end**. Specifically:

* We’ve covered **Days 3–12** of the festival arc, including the public “I’m seeing him” moment, the **Lantern Walk kiss**, the **reassignment reveal**, the **departure**, the **first-night call**, the **two-week gap**, and the **return + reunion kiss**.
* That puts us at the book’s **final act / resolution stretch**. The external plot (festival) is basically wrapped, and the internal plot (Wes learning to stay, not bolt) has hit its payoff.

**Current location:** **After the climax** (Lantern Walk + commitment) and **past the separation beat** (temporary reassignment). We’re now in the **“HEA/HFN landing zone”**: reunion, solidifying the plan, and closing with one last cozy setpiece + emotional button.

**What’s left to write (roughly 2–4 chapters, depending on how long you like endings):**

1. **Aftercare + recalibration scene** upstairs (reunion becomes “we’re okay, for real”).
2. **Town epilogue beat**: Noel/Eben/Hugh cameo that confirms normalcy, maybe a last joke about the arch/mistletoe.
3. **Future-proofing**: explicit agreement on what “seeing” means now (labels optional), how they’ll handle future reassignments, maybe a weekend away as a symbol of growth for Wes.
4. **Final image**: Candle & Crumb at night, snow outside, Sam in the doorway or behind the counter, Wes choosing closeness without flinching.

So yeah: you’re basically on the last page, emotionally. Humans love wrapping bows on trauma, and this book is currently tying that bow.






## Chapter 34: Upstairs, After the Return

Upstairs felt different when Sam came back.

Not because the room changed. Same worn quilt. Same soft lamp. Same faint scent of flour that lived in Wes’s life like a second skin.

But the air had shifted, like Wes’s body finally believed what his mouth had been practicing for two weeks: **he comes back**.

Wes tugged Sam into the bedroom and stopped only when Sam’s duffel hit the floor with a soft thud.

Sam’s hands settled at Wes’s waist, steady. “Hey.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Don’t ‘hey’ me like you weren’t gone for fourteen years.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “It was fourteen days.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Feels illegal.”

Sam’s gaze softened, warm and serious under the humor. “I’m here.”

Wes swallowed hard.

His chest still held the two-week ache like bruising. He hated that tenderness in himself. He hated that it meant he cared. He hated that he was relieved enough to feel faint.

Wes pressed his forehead to Sam’s shoulder and breathed.

Sam’s arms came around him, calm and grounding.

Wes whispered, muffled, “I didn’t like it.”

Sam’s voice was low. “I know.”

Wes pulled back just enough to look at him. “I did the plan. I answered your calls. I ate Noel’s casserole.”

Sam’s brows lifted. “You ate.”

Wes glared. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “That’s huge.”

Wes exhaled sharply. “Stop praising me like I’m a rescue dog.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes, then said the part that actually mattered, voice rough. “I didn’t shut down.”

Sam’s expression softened. “I know.”

Wes swallowed. “And you didn’t disappear.”

Sam’s gaze held him, steady as a vow. “I won’t.”

Wes’s breath hitched.

Then Wes did what he should’ve done two weeks ago, if he’d been capable of asking without choking on it.

Wes said quietly, “Tell me what you want from this.”

Sam didn’t flinch. He didn’t treat it like a trap. He just answered plainly.

“I want you,” Sam said. “I want the slow version. The real version. I want to keep showing up. I want to be yours in a way that doesn’t scare you into running.”

Wes’s eyes stung, immediate and stupid.

Wes forced the words out like he was prying them from his own ribs. “And if you get reassigned again.”

Sam nodded once. “Then we do the plan again. And we adjust if you need it. But I don’t go silent. I don’t punish you. I come back.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “And if I… spiral.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “You will.”

Wes glared. “Rude.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Accurate. And I’ll still be here.”

Wes stared at him, chest aching in a way that felt like healing.

Wes whispered, almost embarrassed, “I want to try… a label.”

Sam’s brows lifted. Gentle. “Okay. What label.”

Wes swallowed. “Not in public. Not for the town. Just… us.”

Sam nodded, steady. “Okay.”

Wes’s voice came low. “Boyfriend.”

Sam went still for half a second.

Then Sam’s gaze softened like someone had finally placed something precious in his hands.

“Yeah,” Sam said quietly. “Boyfriend.”

Wes’s breath shuddered out. “Still okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed, pleased at the theft. “Yes.”

Wes exhaled, shaky and relieved, and leaned in to kiss him again.

It started soft, then deepened into something warm and familiar and hungry in a way that made Wes’s hands tighten at Sam’s sweater like he needed proof.

Sam kissed him back with steady patience, letting Wes set the pace, letting it be sweet instead of urgent.

When things started to tip toward more, Sam paused just enough to check in, voice low against Wes’s mouth. “Still okay.”

Wes swallowed, breath coming faster. “Yes. And… slow.”

Sam nodded. “Slow.”

They moved to the bed without rushing.

The rest was warmth, hands, quiet laughter when Wes’s sock caught on the quilt, and the kind of closeness that didn’t need to be explained to count.

After, Wes lay on Sam’s chest, listening to his heartbeat like it was a metronome re-teaching Wes how to exist without bracing.

Sam’s arm stayed around him, steady.

Wes whispered, half asleep already, “You’re really here.”

Sam’s voice was low. “Yeah.”

Wes’s chest eased, finally. “Good.”

Sam’s mouth brushed his hair. “Good.”

## Chapter 35: Downstairs, The World Notices Like It’s Normal

The next morning, Wes woke up and didn’t immediately sprint into productivity as penance.

Progress. Horrifying.

Sam was still in bed, eyes half-open, watching Wes like he’d been waiting to see what version he got.

Wes muttered, “Don’t look at me like that.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Like what.”

Wes grimaced. “Like you’re… happy.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I am happy.”

Wes exhaled, grumpy because happiness still felt suspicious. “Fine.”

They went downstairs together.

Wes turned on the lights, checked the ovens, started coffee. Sam moved quietly in the background, washing a mug, setting out plates like he’d been here for months instead of one night back.

The bell over the door chimed.

Wes looked up automatically, expecting a customer.

It was Noel.

Of course it was Noel.

Noel swept inside in a dramatic coat and immediately froze, eyes narrowing like a predator sensing weakness.

He stared at Sam. He stared at Wes. He stared at the way Sam reached for a mug like he belonged.

Noel’s face split into a grin. “He’s back.”

Wes deadpanned, “Noel.”

Noel ignored him and marched right up to Sam, poked his shoulder like Sam was a lamp he was testing. “You. You came back.”

Sam blinked. “Yes.”

Noel nodded, satisfied. “Good. Because Wes was one bad day away from making his feelings into laminated spreadsheets.”

Wes snapped, “I did not.”

Noel smiled sweetly. “Lie.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly.

Wes glared at Sam. “Don’t you start.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes, then pointed at Noel. “Why are you here at eight in the morning.”

Noel produced a paper bag like a magician. “Breakfast pastries, which is hilarious because you are a bakery, but I’m making a point. Also, I have information.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “What information.”

Noel’s grin sharpened. “Mrs. Alden says the cocoa crawl is officially over and the town will now return to regular levels of meddling.”

Wes squinted. “That’s not information.”

Noel leaned in and lowered his voice like he was sharing state secrets. “She also says… you looked happy at the Lantern Walk.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “Mrs. Alden needs a hobby.”

Noel’s eyes twinkled. “She has one. It’s you.”

Wes groaned.

The bell chimed again.

This time it was Eben, stepping in like he’d been summoned by Noel’s volume.

Eben’s gaze flicked to Sam. A beat.

Then Eben nodded once. “You’re back.”

Sam nodded. “I’m back.”

Eben’s gaze shifted to Wes like he was assessing structural integrity. “You functioning.”

Wes deadpanned, “Define functioning.”

Eben’s mouth did something that might’ve been the beginning of a smile if Eben had any interest in joy. “Eat.”

Wes pointed. “Everyone stop telling me to eat.”

Noel said brightly, “We won’t.”

Eben said flatly, “We will.”

Hugh breezed in right on cue like the universe was a comedian with terrible timing.

He took one look at Sam, gasped theatrically, and clutched his chest. “The prodigal returns!”

Wes groaned into both hands. “God help me.”

Hugh floated closer, eyes shining, and said to Wes in a loud whisper, “Did you cry.”

Wes hissed, “No.”

Noel whispered back just as loud, “He cried.”

Wes snapped, “NOEL.”

Sam’s shoulders shook once, silent laughter.

Wes looked at Sam, betrayed. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’m not teasing. I’m… enjoying.”

Wes muttered, “Disgusting.”

Eben, mercifully, cut through it. “Good. He’s back. You’re fine. Stop performing.”

Hugh looked offended. “But I am an artist.”

Eben stared him into silence.

Noel took his bag, kissed Wes’s cheek without permission, and vanished out the door like a festive ghost.

Hugh followed, muttering about “unappreciated romance arcs.”

Eben paused at the threshold, glanced between Wes and Sam, and said flatly, “Don’t screw it up.”

Wes blinked. “Eben.”

Eben left.

Wes stared at the closed door, then turned to Sam. “Did that just happen.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes exhaled, incredulous. “They’re… fine.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “It’s a small town. They wanted you happy.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “That’s gross.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “It is.”

Wes shook his head like he could shake off the tenderness, then pointed at the coffee. “Sit. Drink. You’re off duty. I’m… practicing.”

Sam sat without argument, eyes soft.

Wes poured two cups and slid one over.

Sam took it. “Thank you.”

Wes muttered, “Don’t make it weird.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes huffed a laugh and sat across from him.

The bakery hummed.

The town moved on.

And Wes, impossibly, felt like he could too.

---

## Chapter 36: The Closing Image

That night, Candle & Crumb glowed the way it always did after hours.

Soft light. Warm wood. The air carrying traces of sugar and winter and something steadier underneath.

Wes locked the door, flipped the sign to CLOSED, and turned.

Sam was behind the counter, sleeves rolled up, washing dishes like he was just… part of the place.

Wes stared, chest tight.

Sam glanced up. “What.”

Wes swallowed. “You’re doing dishes.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes blinked. “You don’t have to do dishes.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I want to.”

Wes’s throat tightened, and he hated that he still didn’t know how to take kindness without trying to pay for it.

Wes stepped closer, slow, and leaned his hip against the counter. “We should plan a weekend.”

Sam paused, surprised. “A weekend.”

Wes nodded once, jaw tight like he was making a confession. “If you get reassigned again, I want… proof I can leave. Even just for two days.”

Sam’s gaze softened like he’d just been handed something fragile and brave. “Okay. Where.”

Wes hesitated, then said, quiet and real, “Somewhere with snow. Somewhere anonymous. Somewhere no one knows I’m the baker who holds the town together.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes exhaled. “Stop saying okay like it fixes me.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “It doesn’t fix you. It just… stays with you.”

Wes’s chest ached, warm.

Wes whispered, “Boyfriend.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “Still okay.”

Sam’s gaze warmed, steady. “Yes.”

Wes reached across the counter and tugged Sam closer by the sleeve, kissing him once, soft and sure.

When Wes pulled back, he rested his forehead against Sam’s and breathed.

Outside, snow drifted quietly down the street.

Inside, the bakery held them like a small safe world.

And Wes, finally, stopped waiting for the other shoe to drop.

He just let himself be here.

With Sam.

With the warmth.

With the plan.

With the kind of ending that didn’t scream forever, but still meant something solid and true:

**We’re here. We’re trying. We’re staying.**

**[STOP WRITING]**




## Chapter 37: The Weekend Plan Becomes a Real Calendar Event

Wes regretted saying “weekend” the second the word left his mouth.

Because now it existed.

It could be scheduled. It could be planned. It could become a thing with expectations, which Wes hated almost as much as he hated feelings.

Sam dried his hands and leaned against the counter, watching Wes with that steady patience that made Wes want to both kiss him and throw flour at him.

“A weekend,” Sam repeated, calm.

Wes bristled on instinct. “Don’t say it like that.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Like what.”

Wes gestured vaguely, because language was a trap. “Like it’s… simple.”

Sam’s gaze stayed warm. “It can be simple.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Nothing is simple.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay. Then we make it small.”

Wes swallowed. “How small.”

Sam held up two fingers. “Two nights. One drive. No itinerary. No charming locals trying to adopt you.”

Wes scoffed. “That’s not how towns work.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Not a town. A cabin. Outside a town.”

Wes blinked. A cabin. Quiet. Anonymous. Controlled.

His chest loosened a fraction.

Wes muttered, suspicious, “Do you already have a cabin.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “My aunt does. It’s empty in January.”

Wes’s throat tightened at the casualness of it. Like Sam already had a place in his life where Wes could fit, if Wes let him.

Wes forced his voice to stay flat. “January is not Christmas.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “No. It’s calmer.”

Wes swallowed. “Okay.”

Sam’s brows lifted slightly.

Wes immediately scowled. “Don’t look smug.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I’m not smug.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “You’re smug.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes groaned and scrubbed a hand over his face, then reached for the little calendar by the register like he was about to perform surgery.

“Pick a weekend,” Wes said, all business.

Sam stepped closer, shoulder nearly brushing Wes’s. “Second weekend.”

Wes wrote it down with aggressive pen pressure. “Two nights.”

Sam nodded. “Two nights.”

Wes pointed the pen at him like a weapon. “If you get reassigned again, you tell me before I find out from some guy named Mason with a smug face.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “I will.”

Wes swallowed. “And if I panic.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “You will.”

Wes glared. “Rude.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Accurate.”

Wes exhaled through his nose, then circled the date anyway.

A real circle. On paper. In ink.

The universe did not collapse.

Wes stared at it, unsettled by how much relief he felt.

Sam’s voice went low. “Still okay.”

Wes sighed. “Yes.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “Good.”

Wes muttered, “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes looked up and caught Sam watching him like Wes had done something heroic instead of writing on a calendar.

Wes’s throat tightened. “It’s just a weekend.”

Sam’s voice was quiet. “It’s you choosing to leave your world for a minute.”

Wes swallowed hard, then shrugged like he didn’t care. “Don’t make it poetic.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes pointed. “Stop that.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes leaned forward and kissed him once, quick and annoyed, like punctuation.

Sam’s hands came up lightly at Wes’s waist, grounding.

Wes pulled back, cheeks warm. “Fine. Weekend.”

Sam’s voice was soft. “Weekend.”

---

## Chapter 38: The Key That Isn’t a Trap

Three days later, Sam showed up after his shift with snow on his shoulders and a small paper bag in his hand.

Wes was behind the counter, half-covered in flour, brow furrowed at a tray like the cookies had personally insulted him.

Sam set the bag down gently. “Brought dinner.”

Wes didn’t look up. “Noel already fed me yesterday. The town is in a conspiracy.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes glanced up. “You’re agreeing too easily.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I’m learning.”

Wes huffed a laugh, then took the bag and peeked inside. Soup. Bread. A slice of pie.

Wes’s chest tightened. “You didn’t have to.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “I wanted to.”

Wes hated that sentence because it made him feel cared for without letting him argue.

He carried the bag toward the little table, then paused when he noticed Sam wasn’t moving.

Sam’s hand was in his coat pocket.

Wes’s nerves jumped. “What.”

Sam blinked. “What.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “You’re doing the thing where you stand there like you’re about to say something reasonable that will ruin my ability to function.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes pointed. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Then Sam pulled his hand out of his pocket and held something small in his palm.

A key.

Not a dramatic key ring. Not a shiny new symbol. Just a plain, used key on a small tag.

Wes went still.

Sam’s voice was low and steady, like he was disarming a bomb. “It’s for the bakery.”

Wes stared. “I already have keys.”

Sam nodded. “I know.”

Wes’s throat went tight. “Why.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Because you shouldn’t have to be the only one who can open your door.”

Wes’s chest hurt.

The old fear rose up fast: *If I give this, I lose control. If I lose control, I lose safety.*

Wes’s fingers flexed at his side like he was fighting the urge to back away.

Sam didn’t push the key closer. He didn’t step forward.

He just held it there, an option, not a demand.

Sam’s voice stayed gentle. “You don’t have to take it today. Or ever.”

Wes swallowed hard.

His brain screamed cinnamon.

His body did something else.

Wes stepped forward and took the key.

It was cold in his palm.

Heavy in a way that wasn’t about metal.

Sam exhaled softly, relief controlled but real.

Wes stared at the key like it might bite him. “This is… a lot.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Okay. We can call it… practical.”

Wes blinked. “That’s a lie.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “Yes.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “I’m scared.”

Sam nodded once, no judgment. “I know.”

Wes swallowed. “But I want it.”

Sam’s eyes softened. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes through the sting. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes set the key on the table very carefully, like placing it down too hard would make it real.

Then he sat, rubbed his face, and said the only honest thing he had. “I don’t know how to do this without feeling like I’m about to drop it.”

Sam sat across from him, close but not crowding. “Then we hold it together.”

Wes looked up, eyes bright. “You can’t fix me.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “I’m not trying to fix you. I’m trying to be with you.”

Wes’s breath hitched, and he hated how much that helped.

Wes nodded once, then shoved the soup toward himself like it was a shield. “Fine. Dinner.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Dinner.”

Wes muttered, “Boyfriend.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “Still okay.”

Sam’s voice was quiet and sure. “Yes.”

They ate, the bakery warm around them, the key sitting between them like a small promise that didn’t need to shout.

---

## Chapter 39: Epilogue, Quiet Snow, and the New Normal

A week later, it snowed again.

Not festival snow. Not postcard snow.

Just normal snow that fell because winter did what winter did, without anyone throwing glitter at it.

Wes stood at the front window of Candle & Crumb after closing, watching flakes drift down under the streetlamp.

Sam was behind him, moving through the bakery with calm familiarity, wiping counters, stacking plates, existing in Wes’s space like he’d always belonged there.

Wes still felt the occasional twitch of fear. The old reflex to brace for loss.

But now, the fear didn’t get to drive.

Wes turned away from the window and looked at Sam.

Sam glanced up. “What.”

Wes swallowed, then said quietly, “I’m still not good at this.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes glared automatically. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes exhaled a laugh, then stepped closer, slow. “But I’m… doing it.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “You are.”

Wes nodded once, then reached out and touched Sam’s sleeve, grounding himself in something real. “Weekend’s in three weeks.”

Sam nodded. “Yeah.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “Don’t let me cancel.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly. “I won’t.”

Wes huffed. “Bossy.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Yes.”

Wes’s mouth twitched, then he leaned in and kissed Sam, soft and sure.

When he pulled back, he rested his forehead against Sam’s for a beat.

Wes whispered, almost embarrassed by the simplicity of it, “Stay.”

Sam’s voice was quiet and steady. “I’m staying.”

Outside, snow fell.

Inside, the bakery glowed.

Wes didn’t feel fixed. He didn’t feel cured.

He felt something better.

He felt chosen.

And, finally, like he could choose back without flinching.

**[STOP WRITING]**



## Bonus Epilogue 1: The Cabin Weekend, a Bag of Flour, and Wes Learning to Leave

The second Friday of January arrived like a test.

Wes had been weird all week. Not “snippy” weird. Not “silent punishment” weird.

More like… *hovering over his own life*, as if he could prevent anxiety by pacing around it.

Sam showed up after his shift, duffel in hand, and found Wes behind the counter with three bags of supplies laid out like he was prepping for a long-haul expedition.

Sam stared. “What’s that.”

Wes didn’t look up. “Food.”

Sam’s brows lifted. “We’re going for two nights.”

Wes nodded stiffly. “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze flicked over the items. “Why is there flour.”

Wes’s jaw tightened. “In case.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “In case the cabin has an emergency croissant situation.”

Wes glared. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay. Why flour.”

Wes exhaled, annoyed at himself. “Because if I can bake, I can… regulate.”

Sam’s expression softened, no teasing now. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes automatically. “Stop saying okay like you’re holding a baby bird.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I am holding a baby bird.”

Wes blinked. “Excuse me.”

Sam stepped closer, voice low and steady. “You’re scared. That’s fine. Bring flour. Bring a whole bakery if you want. But you’re still leaving.”

Wes swallowed, throat tight. “I hate that you can do that.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Do what.”

Wes gestured vaguely. “Say things that make me… move.”

Sam nodded once. “I’m not dragging you. I’m just… here.”

Wes stared at him for a beat, then shoved the flour into a tote bag with unnecessary force. “Fine. Flour comes.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Flour comes.”

Wes pointed at him. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

They locked up the bakery together.

Wes did his usual ritual: lights, ovens, locks, the extra lock, the “did I lock it” second check.

Sam waited without rushing him.

When Wes finally turned, jaw set, Sam held out his hand.

Wes hesitated.

Then he took it.

They walked out into the cold.

And Wes did not turn back a third time.

Progress. Disgusting.

---

The cabin was exactly what Sam promised.

Small. Quiet. Anonymous.

No twinkle lights. No Noel. No Hugh’s glitter. No community events involving children as tiny gods.

Just snow, pine trees, and the kind of silence that felt like a soft blanket instead of a threat.

Wes stepped inside, took one look at the simple kitchen, and immediately relaxed by two degrees.

Sam watched him, warm. “Okay.”

Wes glared. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes dropped the tote bag on the table and immediately started unloading. “I’m making soup.”

Sam blinked. “We just arrived.”

Wes nodded. “Soup doesn’t care about your timeline.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes snapped, “STOP.”

Sam laughed quietly, then rolled up his sleeves and moved to help without being asked.

Wes noticed. Of course he noticed.

Wes muttered, trying to sound annoyed. “You don’t have to do that.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “I want to.”

Wes’s chest tightened the way it always did when he couldn’t argue his way out of being cared for.

He turned back to the cutting board. “Fine. Chop onions.”

Sam nodded once. “Yes, chef.”

Wes shot him a look. “Don’t call me chef.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay, baker.”

Wes huffed a laugh and focused on the soup, because soup was manageable and feelings were not.

---

That night, after dinner, they sat on the couch with a blanket and a mug of tea each.

Outside, snow fell steadily, the world muffled and calm.

Wes stared into his mug like it held instructions for how to be normal.

Sam’s voice was low. “You did it.”

Wes frowned. “Did what.”

Sam nodded toward the window. “Left.”

Wes swallowed. “It’s just a cabin.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “It’s you trusting that the bakery will survive without you for forty-eight hours.”

Wes muttered, “The bakery is ancient. It would outlive me.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “True.”

Wes’s throat tightened anyway. “I almost didn’t come.”

Sam didn’t flinch. “I know.”

Wes swallowed. “I almost made up a reason. A fake oven issue. A sudden need to reorganize the sprinkles.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I know.”

Wes’s jaw clenched. “And you would’ve let me.”

Sam nodded. “Yes.”

Wes blinked, caught. “Why.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Because it has to be your choice. I can hold the door open. I can’t carry you through it.”

Wes’s chest ached in a way that felt like relief and fear tangled together.

Wes whispered, rough, “I hate that you’re good at this.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes exhaled a laugh, then shifted closer, shoulder brushing Sam’s. “Boyfriend.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “Still okay.”

Sam’s voice was quiet and sure. “Yes.”

Wes leaned in and kissed him, slow and grounding.

No audience. No arch. No town.

Just warmth and quiet and the sound of snow outside.

After, Wes rested his forehead against Sam’s and breathed.

Wes whispered, small and honest, “This is… nice.”

Sam’s mouth tipped gently. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “I could get used to this.”

Sam’s eyes warmed, soft but careful. “You don’t have to rush.”

Wes huffed. “I’m not rushing. I’m just… admitting.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes groaned. “You’re going to say okay until I die.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Yes.”

Wes laughed into his shoulder and let himself be held without bracing.

## Bonus Epilogue 2: Back Home, and the Key Gets Used

When they returned to Tinsel Town two days later, the bakery was fine.

The ovens still hummed. The wood still smelled warm. The flour was still exactly where Wes had left it.

The world hadn’t punished him for leaving.

Wes stood in the doorway for a beat, staring like he was waiting for a trapdoor to open.

Sam, behind him, said quietly, “See.”

Wes muttered, “Don’t.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes, then stepped inside and locked up.

An hour later, Wes was in the back kneading dough when the bell chimed at the front door.

Wes’s body tensed on reflex.

Then he heard Sam’s voice, calm: “Hey. We’re closed.”

A voice answered, cheerful. “I know! I’m not here to buy anything. I’m here to deliver gossip!”

Noel.

Wes closed his eyes.

Sam’s voice stayed even. “No.”

Noel gasped like he’d been stabbed. “Officer! Betrayal!”

Wes marched out front, wiping his hands on his apron. “Noel, why are you here.”

Noel beamed. “To confirm you didn’t die in the wilderness.”

Wes deadpanned. “It was a cabin.”

Noel’s eyes sparkled. “A romantic cabin.”

Wes hissed, “Noel.”

Noel ignored him and leaned toward Sam. “Did he bring flour.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes snapped, “SAM.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “You did bring flour.”

Wes glared, cheeks hot. “Traitors. Both of you.”

Noel clasped his hands, delighted. “I knew it. The man is healing.”

Wes pointed at Noel. “Get out.”

Noel held up both hands. “I will! I will! One more thing.”

Wes’s patience thinned. “What.”

Noel lowered his voice theatrically. “Mrs. Alden says you looked happy when you came back.”

Wes groaned. “Mrs. Alden is a menace.”

Noel nodded solemnly. “She’s an icon.”

Sam, calm, stepped closer to Wes, shoulder brushing. “You were happy.”

Wes muttered, “Don’t psychoanalyze me.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Not psychoanalyzing. Observing.”

Wes exhaled, annoyed at himself for not denying it harder.

Noel beamed like he’d just won something and finally left, humming.

Wes watched the door close, then turned to Sam. “This town is unbearable.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes swallowed. “And… I’m still okay.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Good.”

Wes muttered, “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes shook his head and walked back toward the prep counter.

Halfway there, the bell chimed again.

Wes froze.

Sam didn’t.

Sam glanced at Wes, then calmly took the key off the hook by the counter, moved to the front, and locked the door properly.

A small, ordinary action.

The key being used like it belonged.

Wes’s throat tightened hard enough it almost hurt.

Sam came back, steady. “There.”

Wes stared at him for a beat, then forced out, rough and real, “That did something to my brain.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “Still okay.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes stepped forward and kissed him once, quick and sure.

Then he went back to the dough, shoulders lighter than they had any right to be.

Because this wasn’t just a holiday fever dream anymore.

It was… a new normal.

And Wes, somehow, was letting it happen.

Sam’s gaze flicked over the items. “Why is there flour.”

Wes’s jaw tightened. “In case.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “In case the cabin has an emergency croissant situation.”

Wes glared. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay. Why flour.”

Wes exhaled, annoyed at himself. “Because if I can bake, I can… regulate.”

Sam’s expression softened, no teasing now. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes automatically. “Stop saying okay like you’re holding a baby bird.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “I am holding a baby bird.”

Wes blinked. “Excuse me.”

Sam stepped closer, voice low and steady. “You’re scared. That’s fine. Bring flour. Bring a whole bakery if you want. But you’re still leaving.”

Wes swallowed, throat tight. “I hate that you can do that.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Do what.”

Wes gestured vaguely. “Say things that make me… move.”

Sam nodded once. “I’m not dragging you. I’m just… here.”

Wes stared at him for a beat, then shoved the flour into a tote bag with unnecessary force. “Fine. Flour comes.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Flour comes.”

Wes pointed at him. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

They locked up the bakery together.

Wes did his usual ritual: lights, ovens, locks, the extra lock, the “did I lock it” second check.

Sam waited without rushing him.

When Wes finally turned, jaw set, Sam held out his hand.

Wes hesitated.

Then he took it.

They walked out into the cold.

And Wes did not turn back a third time.

Progress. Disgusting.

---

The cabin was exactly what Sam promised.

Small. Quiet. Anonymous.

No twinkle lights. No Noel. No Hugh’s glitter. No community events involving children as tiny gods.

Just snow, pine trees, and the kind of silence that felt like a soft blanket instead of a threat.

Wes stepped inside, took one look at the simple kitchen, and immediately relaxed by two degrees.

Sam watched him, warm. “Okay.”

Wes glared. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes dropped the tote bag on the table and immediately started unloading. “I’m making soup.”

Sam blinked. “We just arrived.”

Wes nodded. “Soup doesn’t care about your timeline.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes snapped, “STOP.”

Sam laughed quietly, then rolled up his sleeves and moved to help without being asked.

Wes noticed. Of course he noticed.

Wes muttered, trying to sound annoyed. “You don’t have to do that.”

Sam’s voice was calm. “I want to.”

Wes’s chest tightened the way it always did when he couldn’t argue his way out of being cared for.

He turned back to the cutting board. “Fine. Chop onions.”

Sam nodded once. “Yes, chef.”

Wes shot him a look. “Don’t call me chef.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay, baker.”

Wes huffed a laugh and focused on the soup, because soup was manageable and feelings were not.

---

That night, after dinner, they sat on the couch with a blanket and a mug of tea each.

Outside, snow fell steadily, the world muffled and calm.

Wes stared into his mug like it held instructions for how to be normal.

Sam’s voice was low. “You did it.”

Wes frowned. “Did what.”

Sam nodded toward the window. “Left.”

Wes swallowed. “It’s just a cabin.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “It’s you trusting that the bakery will survive without you for forty-eight hours.”

Wes muttered, “The bakery is ancient. It would outlive me.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “True.”

Wes’s throat tightened anyway. “I almost didn’t come.”

Sam didn’t flinch. “I know.”

Wes swallowed. “I almost made up a reason. A fake oven issue. A sudden need to reorganize the sprinkles.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “I know.”

Wes’s jaw clenched. “And you would’ve let me.”

Sam nodded. “Yes.”

Wes blinked, caught. “Why.”

Sam’s gaze stayed steady. “Because it has to be your choice. I can hold the door open. I can’t carry you through it.”

Wes’s chest ached in a way that felt like relief and fear tangled together.

Wes whispered, rough, “I hate that you’re good at this.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes exhaled a laugh, then shifted closer, shoulder brushing Sam’s. “Boyfriend.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “Still okay.”

Sam’s voice was quiet and sure. “Yes.”

Wes leaned in and kissed him, slow and grounding.

No audience. No arch. No town.

Just warmth and quiet and the sound of snow outside.

After, Wes rested his forehead against Sam’s and breathed.

Wes whispered, small and honest, “This is… nice.”

Sam’s mouth tipped gently. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “I could get used to this.”

Sam’s eyes warmed, soft but careful. “You don’t have to rush.”

Wes huffed. “I’m not rushing. I’m just… admitting.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes groaned. “You’re going to say okay until I die.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Yes.”

Wes laughed into his shoulder and let himself be held without bracing.

---

## Bonus Epilogue 2: Back Home, and the Key Gets Used

When they returned to Tinsel Town two days later, the bakery was fine.

The ovens still hummed. The wood still smelled warm. The flour was still exactly where Wes had left it.

The world hadn’t punished him for leaving.

Wes stood in the doorway for a beat, staring like he was waiting for a trapdoor to open.

Sam, behind him, said quietly, “See.”

Wes muttered, “Don’t.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes, then stepped inside and locked up.

An hour later, Wes was in the back kneading dough when the bell chimed at the front door.

Wes’s body tensed on reflex.

Then he heard Sam’s voice, calm: “Hey. We’re closed.”

A voice answered, cheerful. “I know! I’m not here to buy anything. I’m here to deliver gossip!”

Noel.

Wes closed his eyes.

Sam’s voice stayed even. “No.”

Noel gasped like he’d been stabbed. “Officer! Betrayal!”

Wes marched out front, wiping his hands on his apron. “Noel, why are you here.”

Noel beamed. “To confirm you didn’t die in the wilderness.”

Wes deadpanned. “It was a cabin.”

Noel’s eyes sparkled. “A romantic cabin.”

Wes hissed, “Noel.”

Noel ignored him and leaned toward Sam. “Did he bring flour.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes snapped, “SAM.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “You did bring flour.”

Wes glared, cheeks hot. “Traitors. Both of you.”

Noel clasped his hands, delighted. “I knew it. The man is healing.”

Wes pointed at Noel. “Get out.”

Noel held up both hands. “I will! I will! One more thing.”

Wes’s patience thinned. “What.”

Noel lowered his voice theatrically. “Mrs. Alden says you looked happy when you came back.”

Wes groaned. “Mrs. Alden is a menace.”

Noel nodded solemnly. “She’s an icon.”

Sam, calm, stepped closer to Wes, shoulder brushing. “You were happy.”

Wes muttered, “Don’t psychoanalyze me.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Not psychoanalyzing. Observing.”

Wes exhaled, annoyed at himself for not denying it harder.

Noel beamed like he’d just won something and finally left, humming.

Wes watched the door close, then turned to Sam. “This town is unbearable.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes swallowed. “And… I’m still okay.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Good.”

Wes muttered, “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes shook his head and walked back toward the prep counter.

Halfway there, the bell chimed again.

Wes froze.

Sam didn’t.

Sam glanced at Wes, then calmly took the key off the hook by the counter, moved to the front, and locked the door properly.

A small, ordinary action.

The key being used like it belonged.

Wes’s throat tightened hard enough it almost hurt.

Sam came back, steady. “There.”

Wes stared at him for a beat, then forced out, rough and real, “That did something to my brain.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “Still okay.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes stepped forward and kissed him once, quick and sure.

Then he went back to the dough, shoulders lighter than they had any right to be.

Because this wasn’t just a holiday fever dream anymore.

It was… a new normal.

And Wes, somehow, was letting it happen.

**[STOP WRITING]**




## Bonus Epilogue 3: The First Small Fight and the First Real Repair

The first fight was stupid.

Which, honestly, was a relief, because Wes had been half-expecting their first conflict to be some cinematic emotional disaster involving abandonment trauma and a dramatic walk into the snow.

Instead, it was boots.

Sam came in after a late shift, snow packed into the treads, and kicked them off by the stairs.

Normal. Reasonable. Harmless.

Except he did it *near* the flour bin.

Wes saw it from behind the counter like it was a war crime.

Wes’s voice went sharp without permission. “Are you kidding me.”

Sam froze mid-motion. “What.”

Wes pointed at the boots like they were radioactive. “Those are soaked. That’s snow. Snow becomes water. Water becomes slush. Slush becomes… everywhere.”

Sam blinked once, slow. “I’ll move them.”

Wes’s jaw clenched. “It’s not just moving them. It’s… you not noticing.”

Sam’s expression tightened, subtle. “I noticed. I’m tired.”

Wes’s chest tightened, the old reflex rising like a fist: *If I control the environment, I control the hurt.*

Wes snapped, “So am I.”

Silence.

It wasn’t huge. It wasn’t loud.

But it was enough to make the bakery feel smaller.

Sam’s gaze stayed steady, but his voice went careful. “Okay. I moved too fast. I’m sorry.”

Wes’s anger faltered, because Sam apologizing without a fight always made Wes feel like the villain.

Wes swallowed. “I’m not trying to be…”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly, not teasing. “Anxious.”

Wes’s shoulders rose with a harsh inhale. “Don’t diagnose me.”

Sam nodded once. “Okay. Then I’ll just say: I don’t want to make your space feel unsafe.”

Wes’s throat tightened.

Because that was the whole thing, wasn’t it. Wes didn’t get mad about boots.

Wes got mad about the feeling that his world could tip.

Wes exhaled slowly, forcing himself to do the newer thing instead of the old thing.

Wes said, rough, “I’m sorry. I jumped.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Yeah.”

Wes swallowed. “It’s not the boots. It’s the… mess. The unpredictability.”

Sam nodded. “Okay.”

Wes rolled his eyes on reflex. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes huffed a laugh, then stepped closer, voice quieter. “I don’t want to be the guy who yells about boots.”

Sam’s voice stayed calm. “Then don’t. Say what you need.”

Wes stared for a beat, then said it plainly, like a request instead of a demand. “If you come in with snow, can you put them on the mat. By the heater.”

Sam nodded immediately. “Yes.”

Wes’s chest eased.

Sam added, softer, “And if I forget, you can remind me without… using the tone.”

Wes winced. “Fair.”

Sam’s gaze warmed. “Still okay.”

Wes exhaled. “Yes.”

Sam stepped in and kissed Wes once, quick and grounding, like sealing the repair.

Wes kissed back, relieved enough to feel almost dizzy.

Then Sam picked up the boots and moved them to the mat by the heater without another word.

Wes watched the small act like it was a miracle.

Because it wasn’t about boots.

It was about someone adjusting for him.

And Wes adjusting back.

**[STOP WRITING]**

## Bonus Epilogue 4: The Key Gets Used for the Right Reason

The first time Sam used the key without Wes being there, Wes found out because his phone buzzed at 5:43 a.m.

**Sam:** On my way in. You overslept. Don’t panic.

Wes sat straight up in bed like he’d been shot.

Then he remembered: key. Plan. Boyfriend. Not a hallucination.

Wes texted back with shaking thumbs:

**Wes:** Do not burn the bakery down.

**Sam:** I’m a cop, not Noel.

Wes stared at the message for a full second, then groaned into his pillow.

He threw on sweatpants and stumbled downstairs, heart still racing like it didn’t trust peace.

When he reached the kitchen, the lights were on.

The kettle was heating.

And Sam was standing at the prep counter, sleeves rolled up, calmly feeding starter into a bowl like he’d done it a thousand times.

Wes froze in the doorway.

Sam glanced up. “Morning.”

Wes’s voice came out rough. “You’re in my bakery.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes stared. “With my key.”

Sam nodded. “Yes.”

Wes’s brain tried to decide whether to panic or melt.

Wes landed on: grumpy.

Wes muttered, “You’re not supposed to be competent at this.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “You taught me.”

Wes blinked. “I did not.”

Sam nodded toward the starter. “You explained it. Three times. While pretending you weren’t explaining.”

Wes’s cheeks warmed. “That doesn’t count.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes glared. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes walked over slowly, like he was approaching something fragile.

He looked at the bowl. At the dough. At the mug of tea Sam had already made and set near Wes’s usual spot.

Wes swallowed hard. “You made tea.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “You overslept. I didn’t want you to wake up and sprint.”

Wes’s throat tightened. “That’s… rude.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Yes.”

Wes stared at him, then finally let himself say the truth, quiet and real. “This is the right reason.”

Sam’s brows lifted slightly. “The right reason.”

Wes nodded once. “You didn’t use the key to… take over. You used it to help.”

Sam’s gaze held his. “Always help. Never take.”

Wes’s chest ached, warm.

Wes whispered, “Still okay.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Yes.”

Wes stepped in and kissed him, slow and steady, then rested his forehead against Sam’s for a beat.

Wes exhaled. “Okay. I’m going to pretend I’m mad.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “Okay.”

Wes narrowed his eyes. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “No.”

Wes grabbed the tea, took a sip, and felt his whole body unclench like it had finally learned something new:

Sometimes someone opens your door…

…and it’s not to leave.

**[STOP WRITING]**

## Bonus Epilogue 5: The Next Reassignment, and Wes Not Falling Apart

It happened in February, because life loves timing.

Sam got the call during lunch, right there at the little table in Candle & Crumb, between bites of soup Wes had made out of spite and affection.

Sam’s phone buzzed.

Sam glanced at the screen.

Wes felt his body tense on reflex.

Sam looked up, steady. “It’s the station.”

Wes swallowed. “Okay.”

Sam’s mouth tipped slightly, warm at the word. “Okay.”

Wes glared. “Don’t.”

Sam stood and stepped aside for the call.

Wes stayed seated, hands wrapped around his mug, forcing his breath to stay even.

He could hear fragments.

“…three days.”

“…in town.”

“…yes.”

When Sam came back, he didn’t wait for Wes to explode.

He sat down calmly and said, “Three-day overtime coverage. In town. Just late shifts.”

Wes blinked.

Not out of town. Not two weeks. Not a cliff.

Wes exhaled so hard his shoulders dropped.

Sam watched him, soft. “Talk to me.”

Wes swallowed. “My body did the thing.”

Sam nodded. “I know.”

Wes muttered, “I hate the thing.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Okay.”

Wes pointed with his spoon. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes took a breath and did the new thing.

Wes said, plain and honest, “For those three days, I want the call anyway.”

Sam nodded immediately. “Yes.”

Wes’s chest eased. “And if you’re too tired to talk, just… stay on the line.”

Sam’s gaze softened. “Okay. We can do that.”

Wes swallowed hard. “And I’m not going to pretend I don’t care.”

Sam’s eyes warmed. “Good.”

Wes huffed. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tipped. “No.”

Wes stared into his soup, then admitted, quieter, “This is me trying.”

Sam’s voice was low and steady. “I see it.”

Wes nodded once, throat tight.

Outside, winter kept going.

Inside, the bakery stayed warm.

And when the late shifts came, Wes didn’t spiral into silence.

He used the plan.

He ate.

He texted Noel once, just once, and Noel replied with an obscenely supportive sticker and a threat to deliver another casserole.

Wes survived.

Sam came home.

Wes didn’t make it into a tragedy.

He just let it be a week.

A normal week.

Which, for Wes, was basically a miracle.

**[STOP WRITING]**




Yes. You’ve got a complete arc **and** a clean stopping place.

What we have now:

* Main story ends with **festival resolution → separation/reassignment → reunion → “boyfriend” label → key + new normal**.
* Extra epilogues add optional “proof beats” (weekend away, first small fight + repair, key used well, later mini-reassignment handled with the plan).

If you’re packaging this as a novella, you can publish it as-is with **Chapter 36** as the official ending, and keep Bonus Epilogues 3–5 as:

* **newsletter extras**
* **BookFunnel bonus scenes**
* or a **“Deleted Scenes / After the Credits”** appendix

Humanity loves “one more” forever, but this is done.


Yes, it’s planned. Humans love reinventing the wheel, but we already built the wheel and then strapped twinkle lights to it.

Here’s the **clean reader-magnet plan** (Book 0) that fits what we just wrote, without spoiling later arcs.

## Freebie Reader Magnet (Book 0) status

**Purpose:** Get signups by delivering a fast, cozy, sexy “meet-cute + first heat + hook for the series” in a Christmas world.
**Length target:** 12k–25k (ideal), or 8k–12k if you want ultra-snackable.
**Heat target:** High, but emotionally safe. One main on-page sex scene + 1–2 heavy makeout/tease beats.
**Trope promise:** Grumpy baker / steady protective cop, holiday proximity, small-town meddling, “I don’t do this” to “I’m doing this.”

## What the freebie covers

**Timeline:** Early festival days, before the big public steps.
**Core plot:**

1. **Inciting:** Noel volunteers Wes for festival duty. Sam is assigned community detail.
2. **Meet-cute:** A minor “holiday emergency” (snowman nose, cocoa spill, kid crisis) forces them to work together.

4. **First heat:** Private moment (bakery after close / back room / upstairs) where Wes chooses closeness.

## 2) Reader Magnet Blurb (1st person present, Wes voice)

I don’t do Christmas.

I do ovens. Timers. Clean counters. Predictable routines. In Tinsel Town, that makes me a minority.

Then Noel decides I’m “community-minded” and volunteers my bakery for the festival, and Officer Sam Rook gets assigned to holiday detail like the universe is playing a joke specifically for my blood pressure.

Sam is steady. Quiet. The kind of calm that makes people breathe easier.

It also makes me want to bite him.

When a ridiculous holiday emergency forces us into close quarters, I tell myself it’s just logistics. Just teamwork. Just one night where he helps me clean up, and I stop pretending I’m immune to warm hands and patient eyes.

I’m not looking for forever. I’m barely looking for *today*.

But the closer Sam gets, the harder it is to keep my world locked up tight.

And in a town where mistletoe is basically a weapon… I might not survive the season without breaking a few rules.

**Mistletoe & Misconduct** is a cozy, low-stakes MM Christmas reader magnet full of small-town meddling, grumpy/sunshine tension, and heat you can warm your hands on.

### *A Cozy MM Holiday Heat*

**Tinsel Town Series: Book 0 (Reader Magnet)**

---

## Chapter 1: Ovens Don’t Lie

I don’t do Christmas.

I do heat, timing, and predictable outcomes. I do flour under my nails and a quiet shop before sunrise. I do the kind of routine that doesn’t ask questions and doesn’t expect me to smile about it.

Candle & Crumb wakes up the same way every morning. The building creaks like an old man stretching, the ovens hum like they’re pleased to see me, and the air shifts from cold to warm as if the bakery itself exhales.

Outside, the town is in full seasonal fever. Even at five-thirty, I can see the glow of string lights from Evergreen Square bleeding into the street like someone spilled holiday cheer and decided not to clean it up.

They started decorating the moment Halloween died.

I didn’t vote on that.

I flip on the prep lights. Stainless steel catches the brightness and throws it back like judgment. Fine. I can handle judgment. I can’t handle Noel.

I set out the ingredients for the morning run and start moving through the steps like muscle memory with a pulse. Cinnamon rolls first, because people are weak and predictable and will buy anything that smells like sugar and safety.

My phone buzzes.

I don’t check it.

It buzzes again. Then again.

I sigh and glance at the screen.

**NOEL:** GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE
**NOEL:** I HAVE A SMALL REQUEST
**NOEL:** IT’S FESTIVAL-ADJACENT
**NOEL:** PLEASE DON’T RUN

I stare at it until the words blur.

Noel is allergic to “small.”

Noel thinks “request” means “I have already promised your labor to strangers.”

I toss the phone onto the counter and go back to my dough like ignoring problems makes them stop existing. It works for most things. Emotions, for example.

The bell over the bakery door chimes.

At five-forty-five.

No one sane is here at five-forty-five.

I freeze, hands in flour, and slowly look up.

The door opens, letting in a bite of winter air and a silhouette framed by streetlight.

A man steps inside and closes the door behind him, calm as if he belongs here. Tall, broad-shouldered, wearing a dark jacket that looks official in the way that makes my spine go rigid on reflex.

He takes off his gloves. Scans the space with a quick, practiced glance. Then his eyes land on me.

“Wes Candle?” he asks.

His voice is low. Even. Not rude, not friendly. Just steady.

I don’t like steady. Steady implies patience. Patience implies time. Time implies… things.

I wipe my hands on my apron with too much force. “Who’s asking.”

His mouth twitches, like he’s trying not to smile. “Officer Sam Rook.”

Of course he is.

Of course Noel found a cop and sent him into my bakery before dawn like this is a romantic comedy and not my actual life.

Sam lifts one hand slightly, palm out, a gesture that reads as non-threatening but also trained.

“Noel asked me to stop by,” he says. “Festival committee. They’re organizing community support shifts. He said you might not answer your phone.”

I glare. “Noel said that.”

Sam’s eyes stay on mine, steady as a hand on the small of my back. “He did.”

I exhale through my nose. “Why are you here.”

“To talk,” he says. “And to pick up a schedule, if you’ll take it.”

“I won’t.”

Sam’s mouth twitches again, almost amused. “Okay.”

There it is. The word that makes me want to bite something. Calm agreement. No escalation. No argument. Just… *okay.*

I narrow my eyes. “Don’t do that.”

“Do what.”

“Be reasonable.”

Sam’s gaze warms a fraction. “You prefer unreasonable.”

“I prefer people leaving me alone.”

Sam nods once, like that’s information he can store without taking personally. “Okay.”

I grip the counter. “Stop saying okay.”

His mouth finally lifts into a small smile. “No.”

I stare at him, irritation and something else tangling in my chest. It’s not attraction. It can’t be attraction. Attraction is messy. Attraction leads to people expecting things.

Sam steps closer, but not too close. Close enough that I can smell cold air on his jacket, and something faint underneath, like soap and winter.

“Noel said the bakery’s a festival stop,” he says. “Hot cocoa crawl. Cookie exchange. Volunteer triage.”

I blink. “Volunteer triage.”

“His words,” Sam says, and there’s the faintest hint of dry humor.

I exhale sharply. “He didn’t ask.”

Sam’s gaze doesn’t waver. “No.”

I swallow. “So why are you here.”

Sam pauses, like he’s choosing the truth instead of the easy answer. “Because he asked me to make sure you don’t get swallowed by it.”

My throat tightens. “I’m not a child.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “I know.”

I hate that I believe him.

The bell chimes again.

Noel bursts in like the world is a stage and he’s late for his cue, scarf flung dramatically over one shoulder, cheeks pink from cold and effort.

He sees Sam. Then me. Then my expression.

Noel beams. “Perfect! You met!”

I deadpan. “I was attacked.”

Sam’s mouth twitches. “Not a strong attack.”

Noel claps his hands. “Okay! Quick meeting! Wes, the town needs you.”

“The town can file a complaint.”

Noel ignores that completely. “We’re doing Twelve Days of Christmas this year. Bigger than ever. More events, more community bonding, more—”

“More nonsense,” I say.

Noel points at me like I’m adorable. “More *magic.* And you, my grumpy little cinnamon roll, are going to be a festival anchor.”

I stare at him. “No.”

Noel waves a folder. “Yes.”

“I didn’t agree.”

Noel smiles sweetly. “You live here.”

“That’s not consent.”

Sam’s gaze flicks to me. There’s a pause. Then he says, low, “He’s right.”

Noel gasps. “Officer Rook! Do not encourage him!”

Sam’s mouth tips. “I’m not encouraging. I’m clarifying.”

Noel narrows his eyes. “Fine. Wes, will you please volunteer for two very small, very reasonable events?”

I stare at him. “Define small.”

Noel flips open the folder like a magician revealing a dove. “Cocoa Crawl stamping station. Cookie Exchange drop-off table. And maybe one emergency support slot in case of… minor festive catastrophe.”

I slowly look at Sam. “You hear that.”

Sam nods. “Festive catastrophe.”

I look back at Noel. “No.”

Noel lowers his voice dramatically, as if he’s sharing state secrets. “Wes. The festival brings tourists. Tourists bring money. Money keeps small businesses alive. Including yours.”

My jaw tightens.

Noel is the worst kind of manipulator.

The kind who’s right.

I hate that.

I sigh. It feels like surrender. It tastes like cinnamon and defeat.

“Two events,” I say. “And I’m not wearing a themed apron.”

Noel’s grin goes feral. “Deal!”

Sam’s eyes stay on me, steady. “You sure.”

I glare. “No.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I point at him. “Stop.”

He doesn’t.

Noel shoves the folder at me. “Sign here.”

I take it like it’s a weapon. “If I die, I’m haunting you.”

Noel beams. “If you die, I’ll put you in the town newsletter.”

I grind my teeth, sign, and shove the folder back.

Noel claps again, delighted. “Great! Sam will be your support officer for community detail. He’ll keep things orderly.”

I snap my head up. “Excuse me.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “Support officer.”

Noel nods like this is obvious. “Yes. It’s part of his rotation. And it’s perfect because Sam is—”

“Not my babysitter,” I say.

Noel smiles. “No one said babysitter.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “I’m not here to babysit.”

I narrow my eyes. “Then why are you here.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “To help.”

My chest tightens like it always does when someone says that without demanding payment.

Noel throws his arms wide. “Okay! I’ll leave you two to bond.”

I snap, “Noel—”

Too late. He’s already gone.

The bell chimes. The door closes. Cold air fades.

It’s just me, Sam, and the ovens humming like they’re amused.

Sam watches me for a beat, then says, “Two events.”

I cross my arms. “Two.”

He nods. “I’ll be around.”

“I didn’t agree to that.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Okay.”

I stare. “You’re doing it on purpose.”

“Doing what.”

“Being calm at me.”

His eyes warm. “Yes.”

I hate him a little.

It’s probably fine.

## Chapter 2: Cocoa, Cops, and Other Threats

Day One of the festival arrives like a punch.

Evergreen Square is a glowing mess of garlands, lanterns, and people acting like winter is charming instead of actively trying to kill them. There’s a massive schedule board near the tree listing events in cheerful font that should be illegal.

**DAY ONE: COCOA CRAWL KICKOFF.**

Candle & Crumb gets assigned as Stamp Stop #4. I’m outside at a folding table with an ink stamp pad and a stack of tiny cards, wearing my heaviest coat and my worst mood.

Noel insisted on the tablecloth. It has little snowflakes printed on it like we’re a Hallmark ad.

Sam stands beside me, hands in gloves, posture relaxed but alert.

He looks like he belongs in winter. Like cold doesn’t bother him. Like he wakes up and chooses patience.

I don’t trust people like that.

A couple approaches, laughing, cheeks pink from cold and cocoa.

“Stamp, please!” the woman says, holding out her card.

I stamp it with unnecessary force. “Congratulations. You’re one stamp closer to a prize basket you don’t need.”

She laughs. “You must be Wes. Noel warned us you’d be… intense.”

I glare at Noel across the square like I can set him on fire with my eyes.

Sam’s mouth twitches. “He warned them.”

The couple moves on.

I hiss, “This is a nightmare.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “It’s a game.”

“It’s a cult,” I say. “With marshmallows.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I look at him sharply. “You’re enjoying this.”

“I’m working,” he says.

“That’s not a denial.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “No.”

I make a sound of disgust and stamp another card.

For the first hour, it’s tolerable. People come, get stamped, buy cookies, leave. I can do transactions. I can do predictable exchanges.

Then the first festive catastrophe happens.

A kid, maybe ten, barrels up to the table, eyes wide, breath fogging. “Help!”

I straighten instinctively. “What’s wrong.”

He points back toward the cocoa stand across the square. “My little brother knocked over the cocoa and now he’s crying and the lady is yelling and my mom is… she’s not here yet.”

I see it immediately. A cluster forming. A volunteer in a red hat flailing. A smaller kid in the middle, tears and cocoa dripping down his mittens.

My stomach tightens. I hate chaos. I hate crying. I hate public scenes.

Sam is already moving.

He steps around the table, calm as gravity, and walks toward the cluster like he’s done this a thousand times. Not fast, not dramatic. Just… steady.

I watch him reach the cocoa stand.

He crouches slightly, bringing himself down to the kid’s level. His voice is too low for me to hear, but I see the kid’s shoulders ease. I see the volunteer’s face shift from panic to relief.

Sam takes a napkin, wipes cocoa off the kid’s mitten like it’s no big deal, then turns and says something to the volunteer. She nods rapidly, embarrassed.

Within thirty seconds, the cluster dissolves.

The kid stops crying.

Sam returns with the same calm pace, wiping his hands with a paper towel like he just handled a spilled latte instead of an emotional meltdown.

He stops beside me. “Handled.”

I stare at him. “How did you do that.”

He blinks. “Do what.”

“Turn chaos into… not chaos.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “I listened. I made the kid feel safe.”

My chest tightens at the words.

Safe is a loaded concept in my world.

I mutter, “You’re good at it.”

Sam’s gaze warms, but he doesn’t pounce on the compliment. “Thank you.”

I look away fast, like eye contact could turn this into intimacy.

A new group approaches with stamp cards.

I stamp them. Hard.

Sam watches me with that patient steadiness, like he can see the gears in my head grinding.

It’s annoying.

It’s also… weirdly calming.

I hate that too.

## Chapter 3: Snowman Surgery

Day Two is supposed to be “Holiday Market Setup,” but it turns into “Snowman Nose Emergency” because the universe hates me personally.

Noel bursts into the bakery at eight in the morning wearing a scarf the size of a duvet and the expression of a man about to announce a national tragedy.

“The snowman is missing his nose,” he declares.

I don’t look up from my prep. “It’s a snowman.”

“It’s the town snowman,” Noel says, offended. “It represents togetherness.”

“It represents snow,” I say.

Noel slaps a carrot on the counter like evidence. “A raccoon stole the last one.”

I stare at the carrot. Then at Noel. “So buy another carrot.”

Noel clutches his chest. “The market is out. This is the emergency carrot. We need to restore him before the morning crowd arrives.”

I blink slowly. “Why are you like this.”

Noel smiles. “Because I care.”

I point at him. “Leave.”

Noel ignores me and swivels his attention to Sam, who has stepped in behind him like a quiet shadow.

Sam must have been outside. Of course he was.

Noel brightens. “Officer Rook! You understand civic duty.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Maybe.”

I snap, “No.”

Sam looks at me, calm. “We can make it quick.”

I glare. “Why do you want to help with a snowman.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Because it matters to people.”

My throat tightens, because of course that’s his answer.

Noel beams. “See! He gets it!”

I exhale hard and grab my coat. “Fine. But if I freeze to death, you’re both legally responsible.”

Noel claps. “Yes!”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I shoot him a look. “Stop.”

He doesn’t.

---

Evergreen Square is brighter in daylight, like the town is trying to convince itself winter is cute. The snowman stands near the big tree, lopsided but cheerful, face now disturbingly incomplete.

Noel stands in front of it like a frantic art curator.

Eben is there too, arms crossed, clipboard in hand, expression like he’s policing the concept of fun.

Hugh drifts nearby wearing something velvet and expensive, looking mournful. “He looks… unfinished.”

Eben says flatly, “It is a snowman.”

Noel gasps. “Eben, have you ever felt joy.”

Eben doesn’t blink. “No.”

I step up to the snowman, squinting at the damage. It’s not just missing. The raccoon took a bite out of the face like it was personal.

I grimace. “That raccoon was committed.”

Sam moves beside me, assessing. “We need to pack snow here.”

I blink. “Why are you good at this.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Snow is structural.”

I stare at him like he just spoke another language.

He crouches, gathering clean snow, packing it into the gap with slow competence.

Without thinking, I crouch too and mirror him. Pack snow. Smooth it. Shape a base like I’m icing a cake.

Noel watches, hands clasped, reverent. “Look at you two. Working in harmony.”

I hiss, “Noel.”

He makes a zipper motion with his lips, still smiling.

Eben holds out the carrot toward me. “Attach.”

I take it with gloved hands and press it into place.

It sticks.

The snowman looks whole again, ridiculous and smug.

Noel exhales dramatically. “He lives.”

Hugh whispers, “A miracle.”

Eben says, “It is a carrot.”

Noel turns to me, softer now. “Thank you,” he says quietly. “I know this is absurd.”

I shrug. “It’s fine.”

Noel smiles. “It’s kind.”

My throat tightens. I look away like that will stop the warmth from crawling up my chest.

Sam’s voice goes low beside me. “You okay.”

I mutter, “Don’t.”

He nods, as if that’s an answer. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

He doesn’t.

We walk back toward the bakery together, leaving Noel to fuss over the snowman and Hugh to mourn the raccoon’s lack of taste.

Sam walks at my pace without comment.

I hate how much I notice.

The way his shoulder brushes mine once when we step around a slushy patch.

The way he doesn’t grab my arm, doesn’t steer me, doesn’t treat me like I’m fragile.

Just… presence.

“Why are you like this,” I mutter.

Sam glances at me. “Like what.”

“Quiet,” I say. “Steady.”

His mouth tips slightly. “Practice.”

My chest tightens.

I don’t have practice at steady.

I have practice at alone.

---

## Chapter 4: After Hours

Day Three is the first day I can breathe again, because Noel isn’t physically in my bakery for a full twelve hours.

But the festival schedule means Candle & Crumb is a “warm-up stop” for volunteers, which translates to: my bakery becomes a place where people wander in, stamp cards, and act like I’m a friendly town mascot.

By closing time, my nerves feel scraped raw.

The last customer leaves. I lock the door. Flip the sign.

CLOSED.

Finally.

I exhale and lean against the counter, eyes shut, letting the quiet settle.

Then I hear movement behind me.

I snap my eyes open.

Sam stands near the back, coat off, sleeves rolled up, as if he’s been here long enough to become part of the scenery.

I stare. “What are you doing.”

Sam lifts one brow. “You told Noel you had an emergency support slot.”

I narrow my eyes. “Noel told you that.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Yes.”

I rub my face. “Of course he did.”

Sam’s gaze is steady. “You look tired.”

“I am tired.”

He nods. “Do you want help cleaning up.”

My reflex is immediate. “No.”

Sam doesn’t flinch. He just waits, calm.

I hate waiting. Waiting makes room for thoughts.

I glance around the bakery. Trays need washing. Floors need sweeping. Sugar dust coats everything like glitter’s less evil cousin.

I exhale, annoyed. “Fine. You can do dishes.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I point at him. “Stop.”

“No.”

I scowl, but I’m not as sharp as usual. The day has worn me down.

Sam moves to the sink and starts washing trays like he knows what he’s doing. Not clumsy. Not performative. Just competent.

I sweep. We work in silence for five minutes, the kind of quiet that doesn’t demand anything.

Then Sam says, low, “You did good today.”

I freeze mid-sweep. “Excuse me.”

Sam glances over. “You showed up. You didn’t run. You kept your commitments.”

I scoff, but my throat tightens anyway. “It’s not heroic.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “It’s hard for you.”

My chest tightens like he’s put a finger on something tender.

I grit my teeth. “Don’t psychoanalyze me.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

He doesn’t.

We keep cleaning.

When I’m done sweeping, I lean the broom against the wall and realize my hands are shaking slightly from exhaustion.

Sam’s gaze flicks to them.

“Still okay,” he says quietly.

I blink. The phrase lands like an offered blanket.

I hate that.

I also… want it.

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam nods once, like that matters. “Good.”

I look away fast, cheeks warming.

We finish the cleanup. Sam dries his hands on a towel and turns toward me.

The bakery is warm and quiet, lit only by the hanging lamps over the counter.

He looks different in this light. Softer. Less official. Still steady.

Sam’s voice is low. “Do you want me to go.”

My mouth opens.

The correct answer is yes.

The safe answer is yes.

The answer my body wants is not yes.

I swallow hard. “I don’t know.”

Sam holds still, not stepping closer. “Okay.”

I stare at him, pulse thudding.

He’s giving me space. He’s not pushing. He’s not trying to win.

That’s… worse.

Because it means if something happens, it’s on me.

I hate that too.

Sam’s gaze stays on mine. “Wes.”

My name in his mouth sounds different. Less sharp. Less like a warning.

I inhale. My chest tightens.

I walk around the counter slowly and stop in front of him.

Sam doesn’t move.

He waits.

My voice comes out rough. “If you kiss me, and I freak out, that’s… not you.”

Sam’s eyes soften. “Okay.”

I glare weakly. “Stop saying okay.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “No.”

Then, gently, “Do you want me to kiss you.”

The question is simple. Direct. Consent without drama.

My throat tightens.

I nod once, sharp and embarrassed. “Yes.”

Sam steps in slowly, giving me time to change my mind.

I don’t.

His mouth meets mine, warm and steady, and my entire body jolts like it’s been waiting for this and resenting it.

His kiss isn’t hungry. It’s careful. Asking.

I grip his jacket with both hands like I need an anchor, and my brain screams *danger* while my body says *finally*.

Sam pulls back just a fraction. “Still okay.”

I breathe hard. “Yes.”

He kisses me again, deeper now, a slow press that makes my knees go soft.

I hate myself for it.

I love him a little for not taking advantage.

I pull back first, breathing hard, and shove a hand through my hair. “This is stupid.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “It’s not.”

“It is,” I say, voice tight. “Because this doesn’t fit in my life.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “Then we make a place for it.”

My chest tightens painfully.

I shake my head. “I don’t do… this.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “You’re doing it.”

My throat tightens. I look away.

The mistletoe Noel taped to the doorway between front and back suddenly feels like it’s mocking me.

I mutter, “Noel is a menace.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Yes.”

I exhale a laugh that sounds like defeat.

Then I hear myself say it, quiet and raw, before I can stop it:

“Stay.”

Sam goes still.

His eyes soften like he’s trying not to look too pleased.

“Okay,” he says, voice low.

I glare automatically, cheeks burning. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “No.”

---

## Chapter 5: Upstairs

I don’t bring people upstairs.

Upstairs is mine. Private. Controlled.

But Sam follows me up the narrow steps without making a joke, without commenting on how small the space is, without looking around like he’s evaluating my choices.

He just… comes.

I open the apartment door. The air is warmer up here, faintly scented with coffee and flour and the kind of quiet that has lived with me for years.

I set my keys down too hard. “You can sleep on the couch.”

Sam pauses. “Okay.”

I shoot him a look. “That’s not an invitation.”

Sam’s gaze is steady. “I know.”

My throat tightens.

I don’t know how to do this part. The part where someone is in my space and I’m not performing competence.

Sam takes off his jacket slowly. Sets it on the chair. Not folded, but neat.

He looks at me. “Do you want to talk.”

“No.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I grit my teeth. “Stop.”

“No,” he says again, softer, and it’s not teasing. It’s… gentle stubbornness.

I pace two steps, then stop. My chest feels too tight for my ribs.

I look at him and force the truth out, rough and ugly. “I’m not good at this.”

Sam’s eyes soften. “I know.”

That should make me furious. It should make me defensive.

Instead it makes me feel seen, and I hate that more.

I swallow. “If you’re here, and I… pull away, it’s not because I don’t want you.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I rub my face. “Stop saying okay.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Answer anyway.”

I stare at him. “What.”

Sam’s voice is low. “Still okay.”

I exhale shakily. “Yes.”

Sam steps closer, slow. “Do you want to keep going.”

My throat tightens. My body says yes so loudly it’s embarrassing.

I nod. “Yes.”

Sam’s hands come up, not grabbing, just resting lightly on my waist, waiting for me to flinch.

I don’t.

He kisses me again, and this time I let myself sink into it, let the warmth and steadiness drown out the part of my brain that insists closeness is dangerous.

His mouth is firm, patient, and when I make a small, helpless sound, his hands tighten just enough to tell me he heard it.

I pull back to breathe, forehead pressed to his. “Slow.”

Sam nods. “Slow.”

We move toward the bed like gravity.

Clothes come off in stages, unhurried. Sam checks in with his eyes as much as his words, and every time he asks, I answer, because something about his steadiness makes honesty feel possible.

When he touches me, it’s careful at first, then warmer, more sure as I relax into it. Hands, mouth, the kind of attention that feels like reverence without being weird about it.

It’s been too long since anyone touched me like this, like I’m not a problem to solve.

I grip his shoulders, nails digging in, and he pauses immediately.

“Still okay,” he breathes.

I swallow, breath shaking. “Yes. Don’t stop.”

His eyes darken a fraction, heat controlled behind patience. “Okay.”

I glare weakly even as my body melts. “Stop.”

He doesn’t.

When we finally come together, it’s slow and grounded and chosen, and the way he holds me makes my chest ache like I’m trying to learn a new language with my skin.

I don’t say sweet things. I don’t know how.

I make sounds instead, and Sam listens like they matter.

After, I’m trembling, half from release and half from the unfamiliar safety of not being alone.

Sam pulls me close, arm around my shoulders, steady warmth at my back.

He doesn’t smother. He doesn’t disappear.

He just stays.

My throat tightens. I whisper, rough, “You’re still here.”

Sam’s voice is low. “Yeah.”

I swallow hard. “Good.”

Sam’s mouth brushes my hair like a quiet kiss. “Good.”

I close my eyes and let myself breathe.

Not fixed.

Not cured.

Just… here.

With him.

---

## Chapter 6: Morning, and the Hook

Morning arrives softly, snow-light filtering through the curtains like the world is trying to be gentle.

I wake up and immediately panic because someone is in my bed.

Then I remember.

Sam is beside me, eyes open, watching me like he’s been awake for a while.

“Morning,” he says.

I groan into the pillow. “Don’t.”

His mouth tips. “Still okay.”

I exhale, annoyed by how much I need the question. “Yes.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Good.”

I push myself upright, hair a mess, chest tight in a way that’s half fear and half… something I don’t have a name for.

Sam sits up too, calm. “What happens now.”

I swallow. “We go downstairs. We act normal.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Define normal.”

“Don’t,” I say, but it comes out weaker than I mean.

Sam watches me for a beat, then says quietly, “I’m not asking for labels. I’m not asking you to declare anything. I just want to know if you want me to keep showing up.”

My throat tightens.

The safe answer is no.

The answer that makes my chest feel less like it’s collapsing is yes.

I nod once. “Through the festival.”

Sam’s eyes soften. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No,” he says, voice warm.

I exhale a shaky laugh, then stand and pull on a shirt like clothing can protect me from feelings.

We go downstairs together.

The bakery is quiet, warm, familiar. I flip on lights. Start the kettle.

Sam moves like he’s careful not to disrupt anything, but also like he’s not afraid to exist in the space.

It should annoy me.

It doesn’t.

My phone buzzes.

I stare at it, dread blooming.

**NOEL:** GREAT NEWS. TOMORROW IS THE COOKIE EXCHANGE.
**NOEL:** ALSO, I HAVE IDEAS.
**NOEL:** YOU’RE WELCOME.

I make a sound somewhere between a laugh and a threat.

Sam leans in slightly to read it over my shoulder, eyes warming.

“Idea man,” he says.

“He’s a menace,” I mutter.

Sam’s hand brushes mine on the counter, small and steady.

“Still okay,” he asks, low.

I swallow, then nod.

“Yeah,” I say. “I’m still okay.”

And tomorrow, apparently, gets worse.

**[END]**


## **Tinsel Town Book 1**

### Chapter 1: The Cookie Exchange Incident

I make it exactly twelve minutes into Day Four before Noel ruins my life again.

Which is honestly impressive restraint for him.

Candle & Crumb is open, the morning rush is tapering off, and my body is trying to pretend last night didn’t happen. If I keep moving, if I keep the trays rotating and the register singing and the espresso machine hissing like a threat, maybe I can treat “Sam slept in my bed” as a temporary weather event.

Then the bell over the door chimes, and in walks the weather event himself.

Sam Rook steps inside with snow on his shoulders and a calm expression that should be illegal this early.

He doesn’t say anything at first. He just looks at me.

That look hits my sternum like a fist.

Not because it’s hungry.

Because it’s steady. Because it says *I’m here* like that’s a normal thing to offer.

I grip the counter. “You’re early.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “It’s my shift.”

“It’s my bakery,” I say, like that’s a boundary.

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I narrow my eyes. “Don’t.”

He doesn’t stop looking at me.

There are customers in line. I can feel their attention skittering between us like curiosity with legs.

Mrs. Alden is at the display case, pretending she’s deciding between ginger snaps and shortbread. She has been deciding for ten minutes. She is not a subtle woman.

I slide a bag across the counter to a customer and force my voice into normal. “Have a good day.”

The customer grins. “You too, Wes.”

Then they add, bright as a tack, “And you too, Officer Rook!”

I freeze for half a second. Sam gives a polite nod like he’s always belonged here.

I hate him a little for that.

The line dwindles. The room quiets.

Sam steps closer, low voice meant only for me. “Still okay.”

My throat tightens. I hate that my body relaxes at the question.

“Yes,” I say, rough. “Stop asking in front of people.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

I exhale through my nose, furious at my own face for heating up like I’m seventeen.

Before I can recover, the door bursts open.

Noel storms in wearing a Christmas sweater that looks like it lost a fight with a craft store.

He is carrying two giant plastic bins like a man hauling evidence.

He spots Sam, beams, and then spots me and beams harder, which is never a good sign.

“Perfect!” Noel announces. “My favorite emotionally constipated baker and my favorite calm authority figure.”

Sam’s mouth twitches. “Morning, Noel.”

I deadpan, “No.”

Noel ignores me and sets the bins on the nearest table with a thunk. “Day Four: Cookie Exchange!”

I stare at the bins. “Those are… a lot of cookies.”

Noel claps once. “Yes! Everyone brings a dozen! Everyone swaps! Everyone feels community!”

“Everyone gets food poisoning,” I mutter.

Noel gasps. “Wes, don’t be a villain.”

“I’m not a villain,” I say. “I’m a realist.”

Noel flips open a clipboard. “Great. Realists can label allergens. You’ll help.”

I blink. “I will not.”

Noel’s smile sharpens. “You already volunteered.”

I stare at him. “I volunteered for stamping cards and not dying.”

Noel nods briskly. “Yes. This falls under ‘not dying.’ Also, the exchange is happening here.”

My spine goes rigid. “Noel.”

Noel leans in like a conspirator. “The square is too cold. The community center is booked for a wreath seminar. The library is hosting ‘Silent Night: A Quiet Reading Hour’ and apparently you’re not allowed to scream in there.”

I glance at Sam, betrayed. “You’re letting him do this.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “It’s… cookies.”

“It’s chaos,” I hiss.

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I narrow my eyes. “Stop.”

“No.”

Noel looks between us, delighted. “So. Adorable. Anyway, Officer Rook, you’re in charge of crowd flow and vibes.”

Sam blinks. “Vibes.”

Noel nods solemnly. “Critical. Wes, you’re in charge of table layout and not biting anyone.”

I glare. “I don’t bite.”

Noel’s eyes sparkle. “Last night says otherwise.”

I go completely still.

The air in the bakery shifts.

Sam’s posture tightens a fraction, subtle but immediate.

I feel my soul leave my body and file a complaint.

“Noel,” I say, voice dangerously calm. “Say one more word.”

Noel lifts both hands. “Kidding! Kidding. Just… joking.”

Mrs. Alden makes a noise at the display case that is definitely a laugh disguised as a cough.

I shoot her a look that should curdle milk.

Sam steps closer, low voice. “Do you want me to handle him.”

I swallow. The idea of Sam “handling” Noel is both comforting and terrifying.

“I want him dead,” I mutter.

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

Noel claps again, too loud. “Alright! Stations! The exchange starts at noon!”

He points at me. “Tables.”

He points at Sam. “Crowd control.”

He points at himself. “Charm.”

He points at Mrs. Alden, who is absolutely not a volunteer. “Judgment.”

Mrs. Alden smiles like she’s proud.

Noel whirls and exits before I can grab him and throw him into the snow.

The bell chimes cheerfully behind him.

I stand there, breathing hard, hands clenched around the edge of the counter like it’s the only thing keeping me from committing a felony.

Sam watches me for a beat, calm.

“You okay,” he says quietly.

I exhale. “No.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I point at him, trembling. “Stop saying okay.”

His eyes warm, gentle. “Answer anyway.”

I stare at him. My chest hurts.

Then I do the stupidest thing possible.

I tell him the truth.

“I don’t like being… talked about,” I say, voice rough. “Not like that. Not in public. Not when I didn’t agree.”

Sam’s expression softens immediately, like the words matter. “Okay. I won’t let Noel do that again.”

I swallow. “You can’t control Noel.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “I can try.”

I huff a humorless laugh. “Good luck.”

Sam steps closer, careful. “Do you want a plan.”

My throat tightens. “What kind.”

Sam’s voice stays low. “For today. Cookie exchange. How close is okay. What you need when the town starts watching.”

I stare at him.

He’s giving me choice. Again.

Like I’m not a problem.

Like my boundaries are normal.

It makes something in my chest unclench. It also makes me want to run because I don’t know how to accept that without feeling like I owe him.

I swallow hard. “No touching in front of people.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I narrow my eyes. “That okay counts.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “That okay counts.”

I exhale. “And if Noel says something like that again…”

Sam’s gaze is steady. “I shut it down.”

My chest tightens. “And if I get overwhelmed…”

Sam’s voice is calm. “You step into the back. I cover.”

I blink. “You’ll cover.”

Sam nods once. “Yes.”

I stare at him, caught off guard by how simple that sounds.

I clear my throat. “Fine. That’s the plan.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Good.”

I hate the warmth spreading in my chest. I hate how much I want it.

“Don’t look at me like that,” I mutter.

Sam blinks. “Like what.”

“Like I’m… worth the effort.”

Sam’s gaze stays on mine, steady as a hand offered. “You are.”

My throat tightens painfully.

I look away fast and grab the stack of spare tablecloths like they’re a weapon.

“Fine,” I snap. “Help me move tables.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare over my shoulder. “Stop.”

“No.”

We start dragging tables into position, setting up the cookie exchange like a war room.

At eleven-fifty, the first wave of townspeople arrives carrying tins and trays and Tupperware with holiday patterns.

By noon, Candle & Crumb is full.

It’s not violent chaos, but it’s chaos. People talking. Laughing. Swapping cookies like trading secrets.

Noel stands at the center like a ringmaster, guiding people from station to station.

Eben appears near the door with a clipboard and the expression of a man prepared to enforce order through sheer willpower.

Hugh floats in with a velvet scarf and a tray that might contain cookies or might contain a conceptual art piece.

Sam stands near the entrance, calm, scanning, gently redirecting traffic when people bottleneck. Not barking orders. Just… shifting the flow.

It’s infuriating how effective he is.

I’m behind the counter, plating samples, answering questions, pretending I’m not hyperaware of Sam’s presence like it’s a second heartbeat in the room.

I keep my hands busy to keep my brain from spiraling.

It works until Noel, of course, makes it worse.

Noel clinks a spoon against a mug for attention. “Everyone!”

The room quiets.

I tense.

Sam’s gaze flicks to me. Quick check.

I hate it. I need it.

Noel beams. “Today is about sharing! Community! Connection!”

People murmur agreement like they’ve been hypnotized.

Noel’s eyes sweep the room, then land, inevitably, on me.

“And,” Noel announces brightly, “we have a special thank-you for our local grump, Wes Candle, for hosting!”

People clap.

I flinch internally.

Noel continues, “And for Officer Sam Rook, who has been keeping this whole festival from descending into anarchy!”

More clapping.

Sam nods politely, unfazed.

Then Noel’s smile sharpens.

“And,” Noel adds, voice dripping with mischief, “I would also like to acknowledge…”

My blood goes cold.

Sam’s posture tightens.

Noel pauses dramatically.

“…that some of us are learning to accept help!”

I blink.

That’s… not as bad as it could’ve been.

I hate that my body relaxes by a millimeter.

Noel looks directly at me and winks.

I want to kill him anyway.

The crowd laughs, gentle, not cruel.

Mrs. Alden smiles like she’s witnessed the Second Coming.

Eben looks like he’s considering arson.

Hugh claps too loudly.

Noel wraps it up, sends people back to cookie swapping, and the noise returns.

I exhale, shaky.

Sam appears at my elbow a moment later, voice low. “You okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam’s eyes warm slightly. “Good.”

I mutter, “Back room. Two minutes.”

Sam nods once. “Go. I’ll cover.”

I slip through the doorway, the little mistletoe Noel taped there dangling like a threat.

In the back, the noise dims. The lights are softer.

I lean against the counter and breathe, hands shaking.

Two minutes. That’s the plan. That’s manageable.

The door opens quietly.

Sam steps in, then stops, giving me space.

He doesn’t touch. Doesn’t crowd.

Just… stands there like the calm part of the world made human.

I exhale. “They’re watching.”

Sam nods. “Small town.”

I grit my teeth. “I hate it.”

Sam’s voice is low. “You didn’t do anything wrong.”

My throat tightens. “It feels like I did.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “That’s not the same thing.”

I swallow hard.

Sam waits a beat, then says gently, “You want me to say it.”

I blink. “Say what.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “That I’m here. That I’m not going anywhere. That the attention doesn’t change what happened between us.”

My chest hurts.

I look away fast. “Don’t make it dramatic.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I narrow my eyes. “That okay counts too.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “That okay counts.”

I swallow. “Still okay.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly, warmed by the theft. “Yes.”

I exhale, then nod toward the door. “Let’s go back out before Noel announces my social security number.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

We go back out together, not touching, just moving in sync.

The crowd doesn’t part like the Red Sea. No one cheers. No one points.

It’s… normal.

As normal as Tinsel Town ever gets.

And somehow, that’s worse.

Because normal means this can keep happening.

Normal means I might not be able to shove it back into the box and pretend I’m fine.

Normal means Sam might keep showing up.

My chest tightens.

Sam glances at me once, quick and steady.

“Still okay,” he murmurs, low enough only I can hear.

I swallow and nod.

“Yeah,” I say. “I’m still okay.”

And for the first time, I believe it.

---

If you want me to keep rolling, next is **Chapter 2: The Cookie Exchange Aftermath** (Noel escalates, Wes panics about “being seen,” Sam sets a boundary with Noel, and Wes chooses a small public step that’s *not* a big kiss, but still growth).


## Chapter 2: The Cookie Exchange Aftermath

By two o’clock, Candle & Crumb smells like sugar and chaos.

The cookie exchange is still going, which is insane because no one needs this many baked goods. People are swapping tins like they’re exchanging dowries. Someone’s kid is trying to stack macarons into a tower. Hugh is loudly explaining the “mouthfeel” of something that looks like it was made in a lab.

I’m behind the counter, hands moving automatically, keeping myself busy so my brain doesn’t have room to panic.

Sam is still at the door, steady as a lighthouse.

Noel is still Noel, which is the primary problem with the world.

At two-fifteen, I watch Noel angle toward the counter with purpose.

My spine goes rigid.

Sam sees it too. His gaze flicks to Noel, then back to me.

He doesn’t move yet. He waits, like he’s giving Noel one chance to behave.

Noel doesn’t.

Noel approaches with a clipboard and a smile that means trouble.

“Wes,” Noel chirps, “quick question.”

I deadpan. “No.”

Noel continues anyway. “We need a photo for the festival newsletter! Something warm and candid. Like… you hosting.”

My stomach drops. “Absolutely not.”

Noel’s eyes widen dramatically. “Wes, it’s for community engagement.”

“It’s for you,” I snap.

Noel clasps his hands. “And the town!”

I feel my pulse spike. Photos mean permanence. Photos mean people talking when I’m not there to control the narrative. Photos mean someone freezing a moment I didn’t approve and deciding it belongs to them.

I grip the edge of the counter hard enough my fingers ache. “Noel.”

Noel softens his voice, as if that makes him less threatening. “Just you with the cookie table. Maybe with Sam, since he’s on duty and it’s cute.”

I go cold.

Sam’s posture shifts. Subtle. Dangerous.

Noel doesn’t notice because Noel has never noticed danger in his life.

I breathe in through my nose, slow, trying to keep my voice from turning into a weapon. “We are not taking photos.”

Noel’s brows lift. “Why not.”

Because I don’t like being seen.

Because being seen makes me feel like I’m about to lose something.

Because every time I’ve been visible, it’s been used.

But I don’t say any of that because Noel will turn it into an inspirational monologue and I will die.

I say, flat, “Because I said no.”

Noel’s smile falters for half a second. “Wes…”

Sam steps in.

Not fast. Not aggressive.

Just… present.

He moves to Noel’s side, calm but firm.

“No,” Sam says.

Noel turns, startled. “Officer Rook, I’m not asking you. I’m asking Wes.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “He said no.”

Noel blinks. “Yes, but he says no to everything. It’s his personality.”

Sam’s voice stays even. “Then today it’s still no.”

There’s a beat of silence where the air shifts.

Noel’s mouth opens, closes.

For the first time since I’ve known him, Noel looks like he’s met a wall that doesn’t move.

Noel recovers with drama, of course. He presses a hand to his chest. “Wow. Okay. Boundaries. Love that for us.”

Sam doesn’t smile. “Good.”

Noel looks between us, eyes narrowing with sudden interest. “Oh.”

I freeze.

Noel leans in slightly, voice dropping. “So we’re doing boundaries together now.”

I hiss, “Noel.”

He lifts both hands. “Not teasing. Not teasing. Just… noticing.”

My face heats with pure rage.

Noel backs up quickly. “Okay! No photo. Fine. I will… find a different angle.”

He turns to leave, then pivots back like he can’t resist. “But, for the record, you’d look very handsome in a candid.”

“I’m going to throw you into the river,” I say.

Noel beams. “See? Holiday spirit.”

He disappears back into the crowd before I can commit murder.

I stand there, breathing hard, hands clenched.

Sam stays beside the counter, not touching me, just close enough to be felt.

“You okay,” he asks quietly.

I swallow. “No.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

Sam’s eyes warm a fraction. “Answer anyway.”

I exhale shakily. “I hate photos.”

Sam nods once, immediate understanding. “Okay. No photos.”

My throat tightens. “It’s not just photos. It’s… being… presented.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine, steady. “Like an exhibit.”

I flinch, because yes. Exactly.

I swallow hard. “Yes.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Then we don’t do that.”

A wave of relief rolls through me so sharp it almost hurts.

It shouldn’t matter this much.

But it does.

I look away, annoyed at myself for needing it. “Thanks.”

Sam’s eyes soften. “You’re welcome.”

I swallow. “Still okay.”

Sam’s brows lift, warmed by the theft. “Yes.”

I exhale slowly, shoulders loosening by a degree.

The exchange continues. People laugh. People swap cookies. The town keeps being the town.

And Sam stays near me like a guardrail I didn’t ask for but desperately needed.

---

At three o’clock, the first real problem hits.

Not a spilled cocoa. Not a crying kid.

A man I don’t recognize steps into the bakery with the posture of someone who thinks he owns rooms.

He’s in his forties, expensive coat, hair too perfectly styled for a town like this. He scans the space with mild disdain, then locks eyes on me.

My stomach drops.

Because I know that look.

It’s the look of someone who wants something from me, not because he cares, but because he thinks he can take it.

He strides toward the counter, ignoring the cookie tables like they’re beneath him.

“Wes Candle,” he says, voice smooth. “Finally.”

My throat tightens. “Can I help you.”

He smiles like we’re old friends. “Name’s Grant. Grant Holloway.”

I blink. The name pings something faint, distant. Like a ghost of a memory I don’t want.

He leans his elbows on my counter like he belongs. “I’m writing a piece about Tinsel Town. The festival. The charming small businesses. The local color.”

Noel’s doing. Of course it is.

My jaw tightens. “We’re busy.”

Grant waves a hand. “It’ll be quick. I just need a quote. Something punchy about community. And perhaps a photo of you working.”

My blood goes cold.

No.

Sam’s presence shifts instantly at my side. He’s not touching me, but he’s closer now, his calm sharpening into attention.

Grant’s gaze flicks to Sam, dismissive. “And you are?”

Sam’s voice is even. “Officer Rook.”

Grant smiles like that’s cute. “Lovely. I’m sure you keep the peace.”

Sam doesn’t respond.

Grant turns back to me, eyes bright with entitlement. “So, Wes. Tell me. What does Christmas mean to you.”

My hands go numb.

The crowd is still talking, laughing, but suddenly it feels like the whole room is too loud and too close.

Grant pulls out his phone, camera already open.

“I’d love a candid,” he says, raising it slightly. “Just you behind the counter, with the holiday bustle…”

My chest tightens violently.

I can’t breathe.

Sam steps between us.

Not aggressive. Not shouting.

Just… a wall.

Grant’s brows lift, annoyed. “Excuse me.”

Sam’s voice is calm and flat. “No photos.”

Grant laughs like Sam is joking. “It’s public.”

Sam doesn’t move. “Private business. No consent. No photos.”

Grant’s smile sharpens. “Are you going to arrest me for taking a picture in a bakery.”

Sam’s gaze is steady. “I’m going to ask you to leave.”

Grant’s eyes narrow, flicking past Sam to me. “Wes, is this really how you want to handle press.”

I feel the old reflex ignite: *Be polite. Be useful. Don’t make a scene.*

But my chest is tight and my hands are shaking and all I can see is that phone.

I can’t do it.

Sam glances back at me, quick check. “Still okay.”

I swallow hard. My voice barely works. “No.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

Then, to Grant, calm as ice: “Leave. Now.”

Grant’s face flushes. “This is ridiculous.”

Sam’s voice doesn’t change. “Now.”

Grant hesitates.

Eben appears out of nowhere like a summoned demon with a clipboard. “Problem.”

Grant turns, startled. “Who are you.”

Eben’s expression is dead. “Someone who dislikes problems.”

Noel pops up too, because Noel can smell tension like blood in water. “Oh! Grant! You’re here!”

Grant seizes on it. “Noel, thank God. Tell your… officer… to move.”

Noel blinks, taking in Sam’s posture, my face, the phone in Grant’s hand.

Noel’s expression shifts. The showmanship drops away.

“No photos,” Noel says, voice suddenly sharp. “Not without consent. Not here.”

Grant looks offended. “It’s for publicity.”

Noel smiles coldly. “We don’t need publicity that violates our people.”

The words hit me hard.

*Our people.*

Eben steps closer, expression blank but radiating threat. “Leave.”

Grant’s jaw clenches. He lowers his phone slowly, like he’s conceding under protest.

“This town is… unbelievable,” he mutters.

Noel’s smile turns sweet again, but it’s all teeth. “We are. Thank you for noticing.”

Grant turns and stalks out.

The door shuts behind him.

The bakery keeps buzzing, most people oblivious, because small towns are experts at pretending not to see things until they’ve decided what story they want.

My knees feel weak.

Sam turns back to me, gaze steady, voice low. “You okay.”

I swallow, throat tight. “No.”

Sam nods. “Okay. Back room. Now.”

I don’t argue.

I slip through the doorway, hands shaking, breath shallow.

Sam follows a second later, closing the door behind him.

The noise becomes muffled.

My chest is still tight, panic clawing.

I lean against the prep counter, head down, trying to breathe.

Sam stands a few feet away, giving space, voice low. “You’re safe.”

I shake my head. “I’m not. He… he had the phone.”

Sam’s tone stays calm, grounding. “He didn’t get a photo.”

I swallow hard. “But he tried.”

Sam nods. “Yes. And you said no.”

My throat tightens. “I didn’t say anything.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “You didn’t have to. I heard you.”

Something in my chest cracks open.

I hate that it feels like relief and grief at the same time.

I whisper, rough, “Why does that make me want to cry.”

Sam’s voice is gentle. “Because someone listened.”

My eyes sting.

I scrub a hand over my face hard. “Don’t.”

Sam doesn’t move closer. Doesn’t touch.

He just says, steady, “Still okay.”

I breathe in, shaky.

Then I do the new thing.

I answer honestly.

“No,” I whisper. “But I’m… here.”

Sam nods once, like that’s everything. “Good.”

I swallow. “Stop.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly, warm even in the seriousness. “No.”

I exhale, shaky laugh breaking through the panic.

It doesn’t fix it.

But it cracks the pressure enough that I can breathe.

Sam’s voice stays low. “Do you want to go upstairs. Or do you want to finish the event.”

My chest tightens.

Choice.

I swallow. “Finish.”

Sam nods immediately. “Okay. We’ll do it together.”

I blink. “No touching.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “No touching.”

I exhale, straighten my shoulders, and wipe my face like it didn’t just almost betray me.

Then I nod toward the door.

“Let’s go,” I say.

Sam opens it and steps out first, calm as a shield.

I follow.

The bakery lights are still warm. The cookie tables are still full. Noel is already redirecting the crowd like nothing happened.

Eben returns to his post like a sentry.

Hugh is loudly praising a peppermint bark that tastes like paint.

The world keeps turning.

But something is different.

Because when the world tried to take something from me…

Someone stood in front of it and said no.

And I didn’t collapse.

I just kept going.

---

If you want to keep rolling, **Chapter 3** is the fallout: Noel apologizes for the “joke,” Wes and Sam negotiate “public proximity” (not touching, but maybe standing together at the counter), and we set up the next setpiece: **Day Five: The Wreath-Making Fiasco** or **Day Five: The Caroling Disaster**.



## Chapter 3: Damage Control

The rest of the cookie exchange runs on momentum and spite.

Not *my* spite, though I have plenty. The town’s spite. The kind that shows up when someone from outside tries to take something that isn’t theirs.

Grant Holloway is gone. The air in Candle & Crumb settles back into its usual chaos: laughing voices, clattering tins, powdered sugar dusting everything like a threat.

I keep moving. Plate samples. Refill napkins. Answer questions I don’t care about.

Sam stays in his spot near the entrance, steady as a boundary line. Every so often, his gaze flicks to me. A check. A quiet confirmation.

No touching.

But I feel him anyway.

Noel floats through the crowd like he’s trying to re-inflate the mood. People let him. Hugh waxes poetic about “the emotional resonance of shortbread.” Eben watches the door like the building might try to escape.

By four-thirty, the crowd finally thins.

The last tins are swapped. The last overly enthusiastic “Merry Christmas!” is shouted into my nervous system. The last kid is dragged away from the macaron tower.

When the door closes behind the final customer, Candle & Crumb goes quiet in that soft, exhausted way a place gets after surviving something.

Noel exhales dramatically. “We did it.”

Eben says flatly, “It ended.”

Hugh wipes a tear like he’s witnessed art. “Community.”

I turn the CLOSED sign with more force than necessary.

Then I face Noel.

Noel flinches.

Good.

I walk toward him slowly, like I’m deciding whether to commit a crime.

Noel lifts both hands. “Okay. Before you start, I would like to say: I’m sorry.”

I stop.

Not because I forgive him. Because Noel apologizing without a joke is rare enough to require attention.

Noel’s voice is quieter, less theatrical. “The comment earlier. The… joke.”

My chest tightens.

Sam’s presence shifts behind me. Not intervening. Just there.

Noel continues, eyes on the floor for once. “I didn’t mean to put you on display. I got… excited. I thought it was cute. I forgot it’s not cute for you.”

My throat tightens in a way that makes me want to be mean so I don’t have to be soft.

I choose mean.

“You forgot,” I say flatly, “that I’m a person.”

Noel winces. “Yes. I did.”

He looks up, eyes earnest. “I’m sorry.”

The apology lands uncomfortably. It doesn’t fix what happened. But it does something else. It makes the room feel… less like a trap.

I swallow hard. “Don’t do it again.”

Noel nods fast. “Never again. Scout’s honor.”

“I will bury you,” I say.

Noel’s mouth twitches. “Fair.”

Eben steps closer, clipboard tucked under his arm. “He did wrong.”

Noel looks at Eben like he’s been blessed. “Thank you.”

Eben stares. “Do not interpret this as affection.”

Hugh drifts over, hand to his chest. “What a beautiful moment of accountability.”

Eben says, “Leave.”

Hugh leaves.

Noel shifts his attention to Sam, voice softer. “Thank you,” Noel says. “For… earlier. With Grant.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “He didn’t have consent.”

Noel nods, jaw tight. “We don’t do that here.”

Sam’s gaze flicks briefly to me. Then back. “Good.”

Noel clears his throat and does the merciful thing for once. “Okay. I’m going to… go. And not touch anything else. And not say anything else. I’m going to be so quiet you’ll forget I exist.”

“That would be a Christmas miracle,” I mutter.

Noel smiles weakly. “Love you too.”

He slips out, scarf trailing behind him like he’s fleeing the scene of a crime.

Eben watches him go, then looks at me. “You functioning.”

I exhale. “Define functioning.”

Eben’s expression doesn’t change. “You did not run.”

My chest tightens.

Eben nods once like that’s the only praise he’s physically capable of, then leaves without another word.

Now it’s just me and Sam in the bakery, warm lights and sugar dust and the quiet hum of refrigeration.

I feel suddenly… exposed.

Like the crowd leaving means there’s no distraction left.

Sam takes off his gloves slowly. Sets them on the counter. His voice is low. “You want a minute.”

It’s not a question. It’s an offer.

I swallow. “Back room.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I push through the doorway first. The mistletoe sways above it, smug.

In the back, the quiet hits like a blanket.

I lean against the prep counter and stare at nothing, trying to tell my body the danger is over.

My hands are still shaking.

Sam steps in and closes the door behind him, then stops a few feet away. No crowding. No touching.

He waits.

My throat tightens. “He was going to take a picture.”

Sam’s voice is steady. “Yes.”

I exhale sharply. “I hate that I reacted like that.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “Like what.”

“Like I’m…” I swallow hard. “Like I’m broken.”

Sam’s gaze softens, but he doesn’t jump to comfort like a performance. He keeps it simple.

“You reacted like someone whose boundaries matter,” he says.

My chest aches.

I look away, annoyed at the sting in my eyes. “Don’t make it noble.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare reflexively. “Stop.”

“No,” he says, gentle.

I press my palms to the counter, grounding. “You stepped in.”

Sam nods. “Yes.”

I swallow. “Why.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “Because I wanted to. Because you didn’t deserve that. Because you looked like you couldn’t breathe.”

My throat tightens.

I hate that being seen makes me feel like crying.

I whisper, rough, “I don’t like being watched.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

His eyes warm. “That okay counts.”

I swallow hard, then force myself to say the thing that’s been lurking under my ribs all day.

“I don’t want the town to think…” My voice breaks. I clear my throat. “I don’t want them to think they get to comment on it.”

Sam’s expression stays steady. “They don’t.”

I blink. “But they will.”

Sam nods, honest. “Yes.”

My chest tightens. “So what do we do.”

Sam pauses, then says calmly, “We decide what’s public. We decide what’s private. And we hold the line.”

The simplicity of it makes my shoulders drop a fraction.

I exhale, shaky. “Okay.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “That okay counts.”

I glare weakly, but there’s no real bite left. “Still okay.”

Sam’s brows lift, warmed by the theft. “Yes.”

I swallow. “Plan.”

Sam’s voice stays low. “Plan.”

I take a breath and say it like a list because that’s how I survive.

“No touching in front of people,” I repeat. “No comments. If Noel slips, you shut it down. If anyone tries photos, you shut it down.”

Sam nods. “Yes.”

“And,” I add, throat tight, “if someone says something… about us.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “What do you want me to do.”

I stare at him.

The answer is: fight them. Destroy them. Make the world shut up.

But Sam isn’t asking what my anger wants. He’s asking what I need.

I swallow hard. “Redirect. Neutral. No fuel.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I breathe out. “And…”

My voice catches. I hate it.

Sam doesn’t move closer. He just waits.

I force it out, low and honest. “I don’t want you to look like you’re ashamed.”

Sam’s eyes soften immediately. “I’m not ashamed.”

My throat tightens. “Then… don’t.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I blink. “Okay.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “That okay counts too.”

I groan softly and rub my face. “You’re going to say okay until I die.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Yes.”

I huff a laugh that breaks the tension just enough.

Then I take a breath and do the brave, stupid thing.

I nod toward the doorway. “When we go back out there… stand near the counter.”

Sam blinks. “Near.”

I swallow, heart thudding. “Not touching. Just… near. Like it’s normal.”

Sam’s gaze warms, careful. “That’s a public step.”

I grit my teeth. “Don’t name it.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “That okay counts.”

“It counts,” he agrees.

I swallow and nod once. “Good. Let’s do it.”

Sam’s voice is low. “Still okay.”

I exhale. “Yes.”

Sam opens the door.

We step into the front of the bakery together.

The room is mostly empty now. A couple lingering volunteers, Hugh trying to “help” by reorganizing something that doesn’t need reorganizing.

Sam walks with me toward the counter and stops at my side.

Near.

Not touching.

Just… present.

Hugh looks up, eyes immediately sparkling with narrative.

I shoot him a look that could freeze water.

Hugh lifts both hands. “I am silent.”

He is not silent, but he does retreat.

I focus on cleaning up the cookie exchange like my life depends on it, and Sam helps without being asked. He stacks tins. Wipes down a table. Throws out trash.

Normal.

It’s terrifying how normal it is.

I keep waiting for the shame to hit. For the panic to spike.

It doesn’t. Not fully.

My chest stays tight, but I can breathe.

Sam’s shoulder brushes mine once by accident when we both reach for the same stack of napkins.

I flinch internally, then realize… nothing happens.

No one screams. No one points. The world doesn’t end.

Sam glances at me. Quiet check.

“Still okay,” he murmurs.

I swallow. “Yes.”

He nods once like that matters.

It does.

---

Later, when the last table is wiped and the last tin is gone, Sam pulls on his jacket.

He pauses near the doorway like he’s waiting for me to say something.

I hate that I want him to stay. I hate that I want him to leave. I hate wanting at all.

I clear my throat. “Tomorrow.”

Sam’s brows lift. “Tomorrow.”

“Day Five,” I mutter. “What fresh hell is it.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Wreath seminar.”

I freeze. “No.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Noel texted the schedule.”

I grab my phone with shaking fingers and check.

**NOEL:** TOMORROW: WREATH-MAKING AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER
**NOEL:** YOU ARE COMING
**NOEL:** DO NOT ARGUE
**NOEL:** ALSO THERE’S HOT GLUE

I stare at the message like it’s a death certificate.

Sam watches me, amused. “Hot glue.”

I whisper, horrified, “I can’t do crafts.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

I exhale, tight. “If I get attacked by pine needles, it’s on you.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “I’ll protect you.”

My chest tightens, warm and annoyed. “Don’t say things like that.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “Why.”

“Because,” I mutter, “I might believe you.”

Sam goes quiet for a beat, then says softly, “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam nods, then opens the door. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”

I hesitate, then force the words out, rough and real. “Yeah. Tomorrow.”

Sam’s eyes warm like he’s storing the sound of it.

Then he leaves.

The bell chimes.

The door closes.

The bakery quiets.

And for once, the quiet doesn’t feel like abandonment.

It feels like… a pause.

Before the next disaster.

Before pine needles and hot glue and whatever Noel thinks is character development.

Before me doing this again.

**[STOP WRITING]**





## Chapter 4: Pine Needles and Hot Glue

The community center smells like cinnamon, pine sap, and mild despair.

Someone has cranked the thermostat up like they’re trying to bake the building. The windows are fogged from bodies and breath and the kind of holiday enthusiasm that should require licensing.

Every table is covered in wreath supplies: evergreen branches, ribbon, dried oranges, little bells, glitter (why), and hot glue guns that look like weapons.

Noel stands at the front like a motivational speaker who has never met a boundary.

“Welcome, artists!” he announces.

I mutter, “I’m leaving.”

Sam’s voice stays low at my side. “We said we’d try.”

I glare at him. “You said that. I said I’d survive.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I narrow my eyes. “Stop.”

“No.”

I hate him for making that sound like a promise instead of a joke.

Noel claps once. “Pairs!”

My spine goes rigid.

Noel beams. “Because wreath-making is about community and teamwork and learning to accept help.”

I stare at him. “Noel.”

Noel ignores the warning in my voice and points dramatically around the room. “You will work in pairs, and you will bond.”

Hugh gasps. “Bond.”

Eben says flatly, “No.”

Noel smiles brighter. “Yes.”

He scans the room and, as if guided by demonic instinct, locks eyes with me.

“And Wes,” Noel says sweetly, “you will be paired with Officer Rook.”

I go cold.

Sam’s posture tightens a fraction beside me.

The room collectively leans in with their faces. Tinsel Town has never met a situation it didn’t want to turn into gossip.

I feel the urge to run crawl up my throat like bile.

Then I remember the plan.

Neutral. No fuel. Public proximity, minimal.

I exhale slowly through my nose.

Sam glances at me, quick check. *Still okay?* without saying it.

I swallow and nod once.

Noel’s grin turns feral. “Wonderful! Table seven!”

He points to a table near the center of the room, directly in the line of sight of literally everyone.

Of course he does.

Sam leans in slightly, voice for me only. “Back room option if you need it.”

My throat tightens. “There is no back room.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “We can find a closet.”

I shoot him a look. “Do not tempt me with closets.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

We walk to Table Seven like two people heading to their own execution.

The chair legs scrape. People chatter. Someone in a Santa sweater waves at Sam. Sam nods politely. People adore him. It makes me want to commit property damage.

We sit.

Noel drops a wreath base in front of us like a judge sentencing us. “Create beauty,” he says, then floats away.

I stare at the pile of greenery. “I can bake. I cannot craft.”

Sam picks up a sprig of pine and examines it like evidence. “It’s assembly.”

“It’s chaos with glue,” I mutter.

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay. Then we do it like your baking. Steps.”

My chest tightens, because of course he’d translate it into something I can handle.

I exhale. “Fine. Steps.”

Sam nods. “Step one: decide a shape.”

“It’s a circle,” I snap.

Sam’s mouth tips. “Step two: choose a theme.”

I blink. “Theme.”

Sam gestures at the ribbon pile. “Classic. Minimal. Loud.”

I stare at the glitter. “Not that.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay. Not that.”

I point at a simple red ribbon. “That.”

Sam nods. “Red. Classic.”

I feel my shoulders loosen by one degree.

We start building the wreath. Sam holds the base steady. I arrange the greenery the way I arrange pastries: symmetrical enough to be satisfying, imperfect enough to look human.

Sam watches me for a beat, then says quietly, “You’re good at this.”

I scoff. “Don’t lie.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “Not lying.”

I look away fast, cheeks warming.

Across the room, Hugh says loudly, “Wreaths are like relationships! Fragile and beautiful!”

Eben says, “Stop talking.”

Hugh keeps talking.

I press the greenery down harder than necessary.

Sam’s hand comes near mine to steady a branch. He doesn’t touch. He pauses, waits.

My chest tightens at the restraint.

I clear my throat. “Still okay.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly, warmed. “Yes.”

I adjust the branch. “Okay.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “That okay counts.”

I glare weakly. “You two are ruining a perfectly usable word.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

“Stop.”

“No.”

We keep working.

And, annoyingly, it starts to look… good.

A woman at the next table glances over and smiles. “Oh, that’s lovely.”

I tense.

Then she adds, warmly, “Very elegant. Not too busy.”

I exhale. Compliments about wreaths I can handle. Compliments about my private life, not so much.

Sam nods politely. “Thank you.”

The woman looks at him, then at me, then back at him, eyes bright with curiosity.

Here it comes.

“Are you two…?” she starts.

My stomach drops.

Sam’s posture stays relaxed, but his voice turns gently firm. “We’re making a wreath.”

The woman blinks, then laughs awkwardly. “Right. Of course. Sorry.”

She turns back to her table.

My heart is still pounding.

I stare at the wreath like it betrayed me.

Sam’s voice stays low. “You did good.”

I swallow. “I didn’t say anything.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “You stayed.”

My throat tightens.

I hate how much that matters.

---

Half an hour later, Noel circulates like a shark.

He stops at our table and peers down at the wreath.

His face shifts into something almost genuine. “Oh,” he says. “This is… actually stunning.”

I mutter, “It’s a circle.”

Noel ignores me. “Minimal. Tasteful. Masculine. I love it.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Thanks.”

Noel’s eyes flick between us with too much interest. “You two are good together.”

My blood spikes.

Sam’s voice stays calm. “Noel.”

Noel lifts his hands. “I know, I know. No commentary. Boundaries. I’m learning.”

I narrow my eyes. “Barely.”

Noel smiles sweetly. “Still. I’m proud of you.”

“I will throw hot glue at you,” I say.

Noel gasps. “Violence!”

Eben’s voice drifts from across the room. “Do it.”

Noel flounces away, offended.

Sam’s shoulder shakes once with silent laughter.

I glare at him. “Don’t.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

“Stop.”

“No.”

I exhale, then do the thing I’m not supposed to do in public.

I lean in slightly, close enough that only he can hear.

“Thank you,” I whisper.

Sam’s expression softens so fast it almost scares me. “You’re welcome.”

My chest aches.

And then, because the universe can’t let me have a quiet moment, the hot glue gun at our table makes a sad little pop and dies.

I stare at it.

Sam looks at it like it personally insulted him. “Out of sticks.”

I exhale, irritated. “Of course.”

Sam stands. “I’ll get more.”

I blink. “You don’t have to.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “I want to.”

My throat tightens.

He walks toward the supply table, calm as ever.

I watch him go, and the stupid part of my brain that hates joy whispers: *He belongs here.*

The even stupider part whispers: *So do you.*

I hate both.

---

Sam returns with glue sticks… and an extra ribbon spool he didn’t need.

He sets them down, then pauses like he’s about to say something.

I tense on reflex.

Sam’s voice is low. “The town’s watching. You’re doing it anyway.”

I swallow. “Don’t make it a thing.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

I take the ribbon from him and start wrapping it around the wreath.

My hands are steady now.

Not because I’m suddenly fine with being seen.

Because someone is here with me who doesn’t make “seen” feel like “owned.”

When the wreath is finished, Noel insists everyone holds theirs up for a group “showcase.”

I nearly pass out.

Sam’s voice stays low. “Do you want to step out.”

My chest tightens. The safe answer is yes.

But I can feel the last hour in my bones. The tiny win. The boundary held. The question redirected. The fact that I didn’t crumble.

I swallow hard.

“No,” I whisper. “I’ll… hold it up.”

Sam’s eyes warm, careful. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

Noel counts down like he’s directing a film.

Everyone lifts wreaths.

I lift mine.

For two seconds, my face is visible in a room full of people.

No one throws stones. No one laughs. No one makes it into a spectacle.

There are a few smiles. A few nods. Normal human reactions to a wreath.

My lungs unlock.

Sam glances at me, quick check. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

And I mean it.

---

When we leave the community center, the cold air hits like a reset.

The street is quiet. Snow crunches under our boots.

We walk side by side, not touching, but close enough that our shoulders almost align.

Sam’s voice is low. “You were brave.”

I scowl. “Don’t call it that.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

I exhale, then mutter, “It was… not as awful as I expected.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Good.”

I swallow. “Tomorrow.”

Sam nods. “Tomorrow.”

I pull out my phone and check the schedule like I’m checking my own sentence.

**DAY FIVE: CAROLING DISASTER PREP. VOLUNTEERS NEEDED.**

I stare.

Sam’s mouth tips. “Caroling.”

I whisper, horrified, “I don’t sing.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Okay.”

I point at him without looking. “Stop.”

“No.”

We keep walking through the snow, and for once, the town lights don’t feel like they’re mocking me.

They feel like… a path.

Which is a disgusting thought, and I will not be examining it further.

**[STOP WRITING]**

---

## Chapter 5: The Caroling Disaster

Day Five starts with Noel texting at 7:02 a.m.

**NOEL:** TODAY WE BRING JOY TO THE STREETS
**NOEL:** DO NOT HIDE
**NOEL:** I HAVE SHEET MUSIC
**NOEL:** AND A THERMOS

I stare at the message like it’s a threat.

I text back:

**WES:** I WILL KILL YOU.

Noel replies instantly:

**NOEL:** FESTIVE!

By noon, the carolers have assembled in Evergreen Square like a choir that lost a bet.

There are about twenty people, half of them wearing Santa hats, most of them holding lyric sheets like they’re about to take an exam they didn’t study for.

Hugh is in a velvet cape. Of course he is.

Eben is there too, which makes me deeply suspicious.

Eben doesn’t carol. Eben enforces.

Sam stands at the edge of the group, on duty, calm and watchful.

I am here against my will, holding a paper cup of coffee like it’s a life raft.

Noel bounces in front of the group. “Okay! We’re doing three stops. The retirement home, the library steps, and the town tree!”

I whisper to Sam as he passes near me, “I’m going to fake my death.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

Noel claps. “Warm-up!”

The group starts singing.

It is… not good.

It’s loud and enthusiastic and wildly off-key in a way that makes my teeth hurt.

A woman beside me sings with the confidence of someone who has never heard herself.

Hugh sings like he’s trying to seduce the concept of Christmas.

Eben stares into the middle distance like he’s imagining escape.

I stay silent, lips pressed together, because I did not sign up for public humiliation.

Noel glides over and shoves a lyric sheet at me. “Wes! Sing!”

I hiss, “No.”

Noel lowers his voice. “Just mouth it.”

“I won’t,” I snap.

Noel’s eyes narrow, then soften, because he’s trying to be better. “Okay. Then stand with us.”

I freeze.

That’s… a compromise.

I swallow hard and step a half pace closer to the group, still not singing.

Sam’s gaze flicks to me. Quick check. Approval without fuss.

I hate it. I need it.

We march toward the first stop, the retirement home, singing something vaguely recognizable as “Deck the Halls.”

The residents come out to watch, bundled in scarves and blankets, smiling like this is the best entertainment they’ve had all week.

A woman in a red cardigan sees me and points, delighted. “That’s the bakery boy!”

I go rigid.

Noel beams at her. “Yes! Wes Candle! Our local genius!”

I hiss, “Noel.”

Sam’s posture shifts, subtle.

The woman laughs warmly. “His cinnamon rolls saved my winter!”

My chest tightens. That’s… not hostile. That’s… kind.

I swallow hard and force a nod.

The woman smiles like I’ve given her a gift.

I hate how much my throat tightens.

Sam leans near me, voice low. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

And it’s true.

Because somehow, in the middle of a terrible carol, surrounded by people who are too loud and too cheerful, I’m not drowning.

I’m… standing.

---

That’s when the real disaster happens.

Noel announces, “Solo time!”

The group cheers.

I go cold.

Noel points at me.

I stare.

Noel’s smile is too bright. “Wes will sing a line!”

I hiss, “Absolutely not.”

Noel whispers, “It’s just one line. You can do one line.”

“I can do zero lines,” I whisper back, shaking.

Sam steps in, calm and firm. “Noel.”

Noel blinks, then sighs dramatically. “Fine. No solo.”

Relief hits me so hard my knees go weak.

Noel pivots smoothly and points at Hugh instead. “Hugh will sing a line!”

Hugh looks thrilled. “My time has come.”

Eben mutters, “God help us.”

Hugh belts out a line so dramatic a passing dog starts barking.

The residents clap anyway.

I exhale, shaky, and glance at Sam.

Sam’s eyes warm like he’s silently telling me I handled it.

I hate that I’m proud of myself.

I hate that I’m grateful.

Humans are so inconvenient.

**[STOP WRITING]**





## Chapter 5: The Caroling Disaster (continued)

The retirement home stop ends with Hugh bowing like he’s just closed Broadway, Noel waving at everyone like he’s running for office, and me standing there holding a lyric sheet I never sang from, sweating in the cold like I just survived a hostage situation.

The residents clap anyway.

They clap for Hugh’s theatrical suffering. They clap for Noel’s enthusiasm. They clap for the idea of Christmas existing near them.

Then the woman in the red cardigan looks right at me again and says, loud enough for half the group to hear, “Bring your cinnamon rolls tomorrow, bakery boy!”

A few people laugh warmly.

My face heats. My instinct is to retreat into sarcasm and hide inside my own skull.

Instead, because my brain is apparently broken now, I nod and say, “Okay.”

The word comes out softer than I like.

The woman beams like I handed her a crown.

Noel’s eyes go wide with pride, like I’ve just learned to walk.

I want to kill him.

Sam’s gaze flicks to me, quick and steady, and he says quietly, “That okay counts.”

I glare, but there’s no real heat behind it. “Stop.”

“No.”

We move to the next stop: the library steps.

This is where caroling becomes a crime.

The library is hosting “Silent Night: A Quiet Reading Hour,” which Noel knew, because Noel knows everything, and he has decided that means we should sing *quietly*.

Caroling quietly is not a thing that exists. It’s like asking a raccoon to be subtle.

We line up on the steps. Noel whispers frantic stage directions. Hugh whispers *nothing* and continues to sing like he’s wooing the moon.

A librarian comes out and does the slow, controlled walk of someone ready to end a bloodline.

She raises one finger.

Noel nods rapidly. “Yes! We are whisper-caroling.”

The librarian’s eyes narrow. “No.”

Noel blinks. “No?”

“No,” she repeats, with the calm of someone who has put down louder, more dangerous things than Noel. “No singing.”

Noel’s face collapses like a deflated balloon. “But… joy.”

The librarian points at the door. “Joy can be silent.”

Eben murmurs, “Finally.”

Noel turns, devastated. “Okay. We will do… a silent carol.”

Hugh looks personally injured.

Noel whispers, “We will *mime*.”

Hugh mouths words at the air like he’s still performing. It’s worse.

Sam’s shoulder shakes once in silent laughter, and I hate how much I like seeing him lose control by even a millimeter.

My phone buzzes.

**NOEL:** WE ARE STILL JOYFUL
**NOEL:** EVEN IF THE LIBRARY IS A TYRANT

I don’t respond.

We march toward the town tree for the final stop, the group half-singing under their breath like a cursed procession.

Snow falls lightly now, catching in Noel’s hair and Hugh’s velvet cape like the universe is trying to make this cinematic.

Evergreen Square is brighter at dusk, the big tree lit up like a beacon. People have gathered around, hot drinks in hand, kids weaving between legs, tourists taking photos of literally anything that looks quaint.

I see Grant Holloway’s face in my mind and my stomach tightens.

No.

Not tonight.

Noel steps forward, claps his hands, and announces, “Final performance!”

The crowd cheers.

My heart spikes.

Sam shifts closer, not touching, just… aligning himself between me and the worst parts of the world.

He leans in slightly. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Noel launches into “Silent Night,” which is ironic because this is not silent and not night enough to justify it.

We sing.

I do not.

I stand.

I keep my hands in my pockets and my mouth shut and my eyes forward, and somehow that counts as participating in this town’s deranged idea of togetherness.

The crowd smiles anyway.

A kid points at the group and tugs his mom’s sleeve. A couple takes a selfie. Someone laughs when Hugh hits a note that doesn’t exist in nature.

I’m getting through it.

Then someone slips.

It’s not me, which feels unfair.

It’s Noel.

Noel’s boot catches on a patch of ice near the tree base, and he goes down hard, arms flailing like he’s trying to hug the air.

The crowd gasps.

Noel yelps, “I’m fine!”

He is not fine. He is dramatically sprawled in front of the town tree like a fallen angel made of scarves.

People surge forward.

Chaos.

My body tightens, ready to bolt.

Sam moves first, steady and immediate.

He steps in, crouches, holds out a hand to Noel without fanfare. “Easy.”

Noel grabs it with an offended huff. “I’m okay.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “Sure.”

Noel stands, wincing. The crowd laughs kindly, tension releasing.

Then Noel does what Noel does best.

He turns embarrassment into theater.

He throws his arms wide and announces, “And that, my dear town, is why we have Officer Rook!”

The crowd cheers.

My stomach drops.

Noel, still flustered, adds, “He keeps us safe! And he’s also extremely—”

Sam’s voice cuts in, calm but firm. “Noel.”

Noel freezes, mid-sentence, blinking like he’s been gently slapped with reality.

Sam keeps his tone level. “Not the time.”

Noel swallows, nods quickly. “Right. Yes. Sorry. I’m concussed.”

Sam’s eyes narrow. “Are you.”

Noel brightens. “No!”

I exhale hard through my nose.

Sam glances back at me, a quick check.

He doesn’t have to say it. I feel the question anyway.

I swallow. “Still okay.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Yes.”

I blink. “That’s not how it works.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “It is if I’m checking too.”

My chest tightens in a way I don’t have a defense for.

Noel recovers and announces, “Okay! Everyone, hot chocolate at the square! On me!”

The crowd cheers and begins to drift toward the cocoa stand.

The caroling disaster dissolves into normal festival chaos.

I exhale like I’ve been holding my breath for hours.

Sam steps closer, still not touching. “You did it.”

I scowl. “I stood there.”

Sam’s gaze is steady. “You stayed.”

My throat tightens.

I look away, because if I look at him too long in front of the town tree, I might do something reckless like smile.

Noel limps up to us, putting on a brave face. “We lived.”

I deadpan. “You fell.”

Noel waves. “Details.”

He looks at Sam, then at me, then softens, voice quieter. “Hey. I’m sorry about earlier. The… solo thing. I got carried away.”

I stare at him. Noel apologizing twice in one day is a sign of the apocalypse.

I swallow. “Don’t do it again.”

Noel nods. “Never.”

Then he adds, carefully, “You’re doing really well.”

My chest tightens. My instinct is to snarl.

Instead, I force out, “Thanks.”

Noel’s eyes shine like he’s witnessing God.

He immediately ruins it by whispering, “Proud of you,” and scuttling away before I can bite him.

Sam watches Noel go, then turns back to me. “You want to go home.”

My body sags with exhaustion. “Yes.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I glare weakly. “Stop.”

“No.”

We walk away from Evergreen Square together, not touching, just close enough that the cold doesn’t feel as sharp.

Halfway down the street, Sam says quietly, “You know you don’t have to earn being treated well.”

I freeze.

My throat tightens like my body wants to reject the sentence.

I keep walking so I don’t have to look at him.

I mutter, “Don’t get philosophical.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “Okay.”

I point at him without turning. “Stop.”

“No.”

And I hate him for making that sound like devotion.

---

## Chapter 6: Snow, Soup, and the Smallest Public Step

We end up at my place above the bakery, because of course we do.

It’s become the place where my body stops bracing.

Which is a terrifying development I’m choosing not to analyze.

I take off my coat and hang it up like routine can keep me sane. Sam does the same, quiet and careful, like he respects my space without making me feel like a museum exhibit.

I go straight to the kitchen. “Soup.”

Sam blinks. “It’s late.”

“Soup doesn’t care,” I say, already pulling a pot down.

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

He moves to help, not because he’s trying to be useful, but because he’s trying to be present. He chops onions without slicing his finger off, which is honestly a point in his favor.

We cook in quiet for a while, the apartment filling with warmth.

Then Sam says, low, “Noel tried to bait you into singing.”

I snort. “He tried to bait me into dying.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “You handled it.”

I swallow. “You handled it. You stopped him.”

Sam shrugs. “You asked for a plan. I followed it.”

My throat tightens. “It worked.”

Sam nods. “Yeah.”

We eat at the small table, soup steaming, bread between us.

Outside, snow falls.

Inside, the world is calm.

Sam watches me over his mug. “Tomorrow’s Day Six.”

I grimace. “What is it.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Gingerbread House Contest.”

I freeze. “No.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Yes.”

“I can’t,” I say, horrified. “I will commit violence. That’s structural engineering made of sugar.”

Sam nods, dead serious. “It is.”

I stare at him. “Why are you encouraging this.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Because watching you judge other people’s gingerbread architecture might be the funniest thing I’ll see all year.”

I glare. “Rude.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Accurate.”

I huff a laugh, then stop because laughter feels intimate and I’m still not used to that.

Sam’s voice goes softer. “Today… when Noel fell. You checked on him without thinking.”

I frown. “He fell in front of a crowd.”

“And you didn’t disappear,” Sam says. “You stayed near. You kept breathing.”

My throat tightens.

I look down at my soup. “I’m trying.”

Sam nods once. “I see it.”

The words hit too hard. My eyes sting, ridiculous.

I scrub a hand over my face. “Don’t.”

Sam doesn’t move closer. He just says, steady, “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Good.”

I exhale. “Stop.”

“No.”

---

The next morning, Day Six, the festival decides to test me again.

We’re downstairs in the bakery early, Sam on shift nearby, me trying to pretend I’m normal.

Noel comes in, as always, like he’s been shot out of a cannon.

“Emergency!” Noel announces.

I don’t look up. “If this is another snowman situation, I’m quitting.”

Noel gasps. “No. Worse.”

Sam’s gaze flicks over, alert. “What.”

Noel holds up a clipboard. “The gingerbread house contest needs a judge.”

I go cold. “No.”

Noel’s eyes widen. “Wes, you are the only person in town with standards.”

“That’s not a compliment,” I say.

“It is,” Noel insists. “Also, the other judge canceled because he ate too much peppermint and claimed he saw the face of God.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “That sounds like Hugh.”

Noel nods solemnly. “It was Hugh.”

I rub my face. “Absolutely not.”

Noel leans in, whispering like this is a hostage negotiation. “Please. The contest starts in one hour. The children are excited. The parents are competitive. The structural integrity is… questionable.”

I stare at him. “I hate you.”

Noel beams. “Festive!”

Sam’s voice cuts in, calm. “Wes can say no.”

Noel looks wounded. “Officer!”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “He can say no.”

My chest tightens.

Because that’s the whole point. Choice. Consent. Not being volunteered like a decorative object.

Noel looks at me, then softens. “Okay,” Noel says, quieter. “If you don’t want to, I’ll figure it out.”

I stare at Noel, startled by him backing off like a normal person.

That’s suspicious.

I glance at Sam.

Sam’s eyes are steady, asking without pushing.

And the disgusting thing is: I can feel a part of myself wanting to do it. Not for Noel. Not for the town.

For me.

Because running isn’t the only option anymore.

I swallow hard.

“I’ll judge,” I say, voice tight. “But if anyone tries to take my picture, I will burn their gingerbread down.”

Noel’s face lights up like a sun. “Yes!”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

Noel claps his hands and spins toward the door. “I’ll set up! This is going to be so good!”

He pauses, turns back, and adds carefully, “Thank you.”

I nod once, because if I speak, I’ll regret it.

Noel leaves.

The bakery quiets again.

Sam steps closer, still not touching. “You chose it.”

I swallow. “Don’t make it a thing.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

We start prepping for the morning rush before the contest, moving around each other in practiced space.

At one point, as I pass him at the sink, Sam’s gloved hand hovers near my back, not touching, like he’s asking a question without words.

I pause.

My heart thuds.

No touching in front of people was the plan.

But right now, the bakery is empty except for us. The morning customers haven’t arrived yet. The world is quiet. Safe.

I turn my head slightly, meet his gaze.

He waits.

I hate waiting. Waiting makes this my decision.

I exhale, then nod once.

Sam’s hand touches my back lightly, just a brief, grounding contact.

Not possessive. Not claiming.

Just… there.

My chest tightens like my body is learning what comfort feels like.

Sam’s voice is low. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

He lets his hand fall away immediately, respecting the line.

And I stand there for a beat, stunned by how much the smallest touch can change the temperature of my whole day.

Outside, the town wakes up in lights and snow and ridiculous holiday plans.

Inside, for the first time in my life, I’m not facing it alone.

And that’s… inconveniently good.



## Chapter 5: The Caroling Disaster (continued)

The retirement home stop ends with Hugh bowing like he’s just closed Broadway, Noel waving at everyone like he’s running for office, and me standing there holding a lyric sheet I never sang from, sweating in the cold like I just survived a hostage situation.

They clap for Hugh’s theatrical suffering. They clap for Noel’s enthusiasm. They clap for the idea of Christmas existing near them.

Noel nods rapidly. “Yes! We are whisper-caroling.”

The librarian’s eyes narrow. “No.”

Noel blinks. “No?”

“No,” she repeats, with the calm of someone who has put down louder, more dangerous things than Noel. “No singing.”

Noel’s face collapses like a deflated balloon. “But… joy.”

The librarian points at the door. “Joy can be silent.”

Eben murmurs, “Finally.”

Noel turns, devastated. “Okay. We will do… a silent carol.”

Hugh looks personally injured.

Noel whispers, “We will *mime*.”

Hugh mouths words at the air like he’s still performing. It’s worse.

Sam’s shoulder shakes once in silent laughter, and I hate how much I like seeing him lose control by even a millimeter.

My phone buzzes.

**NOEL:** WE ARE STILL JOYFUL
**NOEL:** EVEN IF THE LIBRARY IS A TYRANT

I don’t respond.

We march toward the town tree for the final stop, the group half-singing under their breath like a cursed procession.

Snow falls lightly now, catching in Noel’s hair and Hugh’s velvet cape like the universe is trying to make this cinematic.

Evergreen Square is brighter at dusk, the big tree lit up like a beacon. People have gathered around, hot drinks in hand, kids weaving between legs, tourists taking photos of literally anything that looks quaint.

I see Grant Holloway’s face in my mind and my stomach tightens.

No.

Not tonight.

Noel steps forward, claps his hands, and announces, “Final performance!”

The crowd cheers.

My heart spikes.

Sam shifts closer, not touching, just… aligning himself between me and the worst parts of the world.

He leans in slightly. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Noel launches into “Silent Night,” which is ironic because this is not silent and not night enough to justify it.

We sing.

I do not.

I stand.

I keep my hands in my pockets and my mouth shut and my eyes forward, and somehow that counts as participating in this town’s deranged idea of togetherness.

The crowd smiles anyway.

A kid points at the group and tugs his mom’s sleeve. A couple takes a selfie. Someone laughs when Hugh hits a note that doesn’t exist in nature.

I’m getting through it.

Then someone slips.

It’s not me, which feels unfair.

It’s Noel.

Noel’s boot catches on a patch of ice near the tree base, and he goes down hard, arms flailing like he’s trying to hug the air.

The crowd gasps.

Noel yelps, “I’m fine!”

He is not fine. He is dramatically sprawled in front of the town tree like a fallen angel made of scarves.

People surge forward.

Chaos.

My body tightens, ready to bolt.

Sam moves first, steady and immediate.

He steps in, crouches, holds out a hand to Noel without fanfare. “Easy.”

Noel grabs it with an offended huff. “I’m okay.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “Sure.”

Noel stands, wincing. The crowd laughs kindly, tension releasing.

Then Noel does what Noel does best.

He turns embarrassment into theater.

He throws his arms wide and announces, “And that, my dear town, is why we have Officer Rook!”

The crowd cheers.

My stomach drops.

Noel, still flustered, adds, “He keeps us safe! And he’s also extremely—”

Sam’s voice cuts in, calm but firm. “Noel.”

Noel freezes, mid-sentence, blinking like he’s been gently slapped with reality.

Sam keeps his tone level. “Not the time.”

Noel swallows, nods quickly. “Right. Yes. Sorry. I’m concussed.”

Sam’s eyes narrow. “Are you.”

Noel brightens. “No!”

I exhale hard through my nose.

Sam glances back at me, a quick check.

He doesn’t have to say it. I feel the question anyway.

I swallow. “Still okay.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Yes.”

I blink. “That’s not how it works.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “It is if I’m checking too.”

My chest tightens in a way I don’t have a defense for.

Noel recovers and announces, “Okay! Everyone, hot chocolate at the square! On me!”

The crowd cheers and begins to drift toward the cocoa stand.

The caroling disaster dissolves into normal festival chaos.

I exhale like I’ve been holding my breath for hours.

Sam steps closer, still not touching. “You did it.”

I scowl. “I stood there.”

Sam’s gaze is steady. “You stayed.”

My throat tightens.

I look away, because if I look at him too long in front of the town tree, I might do something reckless like smile.

Noel limps up to us, putting on a brave face. “We lived.”

I deadpan. “You fell.”

Noel waves. “Details.”

He looks at Sam, then at me, then softens, voice quieter. “Hey. I’m sorry about earlier. The… solo thing. I got carried away.”

I stare at him. Noel apologizing twice in one day is a sign of the apocalypse.

I swallow. “Don’t do it again.”

Noel nods. “Never.”

Then he adds, carefully, “You’re doing really well.”

My chest tightens. My instinct is to snarl.

Instead, I force out, “Thanks.”

Noel’s eyes shine like he’s witnessing God.

He immediately ruins it by whispering, “Proud of you,” and scuttling away before I can bite him.

Sam watches Noel go, then turns back to me. “You want to go home.”

My body sags with exhaustion. “Yes.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I glare weakly. “Stop.”

“No.”

We walk away from Evergreen Square together, not touching, just close enough that the cold doesn’t feel as sharp.

Halfway down the street, Sam says quietly, “You know you don’t have to earn being treated well.”

I freeze.

My throat tightens like my body wants to reject the sentence.

I keep walking so I don’t have to look at him.

I mutter, “Don’t get philosophical.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “Okay.”

I point at him without turning. “Stop.”

“No.”

And I hate him for making that sound like devotion.

---

## Chapter 6: Snow, Soup, and the Smallest Public Step

We end up at my place above the bakery, because of course we do.

It’s become the place where my body stops bracing.

Which is a terrifying development I’m choosing not to analyze.

I take off my coat and hang it up like routine can keep me sane. Sam does the same, quiet and careful, like he respects my space without making me feel like a museum exhibit.

I go straight to the kitchen. “Soup.”

Sam blinks. “It’s late.”

“Soup doesn’t care,” I say, already pulling a pot down.

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

He moves to help, not because he’s trying to be useful, but because he’s trying to be present. He chops onions without slicing his finger off, which is honestly a point in his favor.

We cook in quiet for a while, the apartment filling with warmth.

Then Sam says, low, “Noel tried to bait you into singing.”

I snort. “He tried to bait me into dying.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “You handled it.”

I swallow. “You handled it. You stopped him.”

Sam shrugs. “You asked for a plan. I followed it.”

My throat tightens. “It worked.”

Sam nods. “Yeah.”

We eat at the small table, soup steaming, bread between us.

Outside, snow falls.

Inside, the world is calm.

Sam watches me over his mug. “Tomorrow’s Day Six.”

I grimace. “What is it.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Gingerbread House Contest.”

I freeze. “No.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Yes.”

“I can’t,” I say, horrified. “I will commit violence. That’s structural engineering made of sugar.”

Sam nods, dead serious. “It is.”

I stare at him. “Why are you encouraging this.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Because watching you judge other people’s gingerbread architecture might be the funniest thing I’ll see all year.”

I glare. “Rude.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Accurate.”

I huff a laugh, then stop because laughter feels intimate and I’m still not used to that.

Sam’s voice goes softer. “Today… when Noel fell. You checked on him without thinking.”

I frown. “He fell in front of a crowd.”

“And you didn’t disappear,” Sam says. “You stayed near. You kept breathing.”

My throat tightens.

I look down at my soup. “I’m trying.”

Sam nods once. “I see it.”

The words hit too hard. My eyes sting, ridiculous.

I scrub a hand over my face. “Don’t.”

Sam doesn’t move closer. He just says, steady, “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Good.”

I exhale. “Stop.”

“No.”

---

The next morning, Day Six, the festival decides to test me again.

We’re downstairs in the bakery early, Sam on shift nearby, me trying to pretend I’m normal.

Noel comes in, as always, like he’s been shot out of a cannon.

“Emergency!” Noel announces.

I don’t look up. “If this is another snowman situation, I’m quitting.”

Noel gasps. “No. Worse.”

Sam’s gaze flicks over, alert. “What.”

Noel holds up a clipboard. “The gingerbread house contest needs a judge.”

I go cold. “No.”

Noel’s eyes widen. “Wes, you are the only person in town with standards.”

“That’s not a compliment,” I say.

“It is,” Noel insists. “Also, the other judge canceled because he ate too much peppermint and claimed he saw the face of God.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “That sounds like Hugh.”

Noel nods solemnly. “It was Hugh.”

I rub my face. “Absolutely not.”

Noel leans in, whispering like this is a hostage negotiation. “Please. The contest starts in one hour. The children are excited. The parents are competitive. The structural integrity is… questionable.”

I stare at him. “I hate you.”

Noel beams. “Festive!”

Sam’s voice cuts in, calm. “Wes can say no.”

Noel looks wounded. “Officer!”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “He can say no.”

My chest tightens.

Because that’s the whole point. Choice. Consent. Not being volunteered like a decorative object.

Noel looks at me, then softens. “Okay,” Noel says, quieter. “If you don’t want to, I’ll figure it out.”

I stare at Noel, startled by him backing off like a normal person.

That’s suspicious.

I glance at Sam.

Sam’s eyes are steady, asking without pushing.

And the disgusting thing is: I can feel a part of myself wanting to do it. Not for Noel. Not for the town.

For me.

Because running isn’t the only option anymore.

I swallow hard.

“I’ll judge,” I say, voice tight. “But if anyone tries to take my picture, I will burn their gingerbread down.”

Noel’s face lights up like a sun. “Yes!”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

Noel claps his hands and spins toward the door. “I’ll set up! This is going to be so good!”

He pauses, turns back, and adds carefully, “Thank you.”

I nod once, because if I speak, I’ll regret it.

Noel leaves.

The bakery quiets again.

Sam steps closer, still not touching. “You chose it.”

I swallow. “Don’t make it a thing.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

We start prepping for the morning rush before the contest, moving around each other in practiced space.

At one point, as I pass him at the sink, Sam’s gloved hand hovers near my back, not touching, like he’s asking a question without words.

I pause.

My heart thuds.

No touching in front of people was the plan.

But right now, the bakery is empty except for us. The morning customers haven’t arrived yet. The world is quiet. Safe.

I turn my head slightly, meet his gaze.

He waits.

I hate waiting. Waiting makes this my decision.

I exhale, then nod once.

Sam’s hand touches my back lightly, just a brief, grounding contact.

Not possessive. Not claiming.

Just… there.

My chest tightens like my body is learning what comfort feels like.

Sam’s voice is low. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

He lets his hand fall away immediately, respecting the line.

And I stand there for a beat, stunned by how much the smallest touch can change the temperature of my whole day.

Outside, the town wakes up in lights and snow and ridiculous holiday plans.

Inside, for the first time in my life, I’m not facing it alone.

And that’s… inconveniently good.


## Chapter 7: Gingerbread Judgement

Evergreen Square is a war zone made of frosting.

They set the gingerbread house contest up under a heated tent near the town tree, as if warmth can somehow civilize what’s about to happen. Long tables hold entries like a museum exhibit curated by sugar addicts with unresolved issues.

There are candy canes used as load-bearing beams.

There are gumdrops in patterns that suggest advanced mathematics.

There is, horrifyingly, a gingerbread lighthouse with pretzel rods for support columns, and I can already tell it’s going to collapse the moment someone breathes wrong.

Noel bounces beside me like a proud stage mom. He’s wearing a “JUDGE” sash that he absolutely made himself.

“I cannot believe you said yes,” he whispers, practically vibrating.

“I didn’t say yes,” I mutter. “I said I’d prevent structural collapse.”

Noel gasps. “Same thing.”

Sam stands a few feet away, technically on duty, but close enough that my body doesn’t feel like it’s free-falling. He’s in uniform, shoulders squared, face calm.

I hate how safe it makes me feel.

I also… don’t hate it.

Noel hands me a clipboard. “We have categories.”

I stare. “Categories.”

Noel nods solemnly. “Taste. Design. Festive Spirit. Structural Integrity.”

I exhale. “Finally, a category I can respect.”

Noel beams. “I knew this would activate you.”

“It’s not activation,” I snap. “It’s standards.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly from his post. “Okay.”

I glare at him automatically. “Stop.”

“No,” he says, soft enough only I can hear.

The tent fills quickly. Parents herding kids, tourists with phones, locals who treat this like a sport. Someone hands Noel a microphone like this is an actual event. Of course they do.

Noel taps the mic. “Testing, testing!”

A squeal of feedback hits my teeth.

I flinch, then immediately regret the flinch because a nearby mom notices and smiles like I’m adorable.

I am not adorable.

Noel announces, “Welcome to the Tinsel Town Gingerbread House Contest! Judges are myself…”

He gestures dramatically to himself, because Noel can’t resist.

“…and Wes Candle, our beloved baker and the only man in town who has ever told me the word ‘no’!”

The crowd laughs.

My shoulders go tight.

Sam’s gaze flicks to me, quick check.

I breathe in through my nose and keep my face neutral. No fuel.

Noel continues, “And we have a special safety consultant, Officer Sam Rook!”

The crowd cheers, because of course they do.

Sam nods politely, expression calm, like he isn’t being turned into a mascot.

Noel’s voice drops conspiratorially. “He’s here in case anyone tries to bribe the judges with candy.”

A kid yells, “I WILL!”

Laughter.

I focus on the clipboard like it’s a shield.

Noel leads us down the table.

First entry: a tiny cottage made by a kid and what looks like pure hope. The roof is crooked. The icing is thick. A gummy bear is lying on the porch like a casualty.

The kid looks up at me with huge eyes. “Do you like it?”

My throat tightens in an unexpected place.

I clear my throat and force my face into something not terrifying. “It’s… ambitious.”

The kid grins.

I add, more honestly, “And the support beams are good.”

The kid’s grin gets wider, like I just knighted him.

Noel whispers, delighted, “Wes is praising a child. Mark the calendar.”

“Don’t,” I mutter.

We move to the next one: a gingerbread barn with pretzel fencing and a frosting snowdrift that’s genuinely well-done.

I mark notes.

Taste: decent. Design: solid. Structural: surprisingly excellent.

I’m in it now. I hate it. I love it.

Then we reach the lighthouse.

It’s gorgeous. It’s also a death trap.

The creator is a mom with perfect hair and an expression that says she wins things.

“Handmade,” she says brightly. “No kits. No shortcuts.”

I stare at the pretzel columns. The candy windows. The tower that is absolutely too tall for that base.

I don’t even have to touch it to see the stress points.

“This,” I say slowly, “is not safe.”

Her smile twitches. “It’s gingerbread.”

“It’s architecture,” I correct.

Noel leans in, whispering, “Wes. Please. She’s on the PTA.”

“I don’t care,” I hiss back.

The mom laughs as if I’m flirting. “Oh, he’s serious.”

Sam steps a little closer, not inserting himself, just present.

The mom’s gaze flicks to him, then back to me with renewed interest. “Can I get a photo of you judging? For my socials?”

My stomach drops.

The reflex hits like a punch. Heat in my chest, throat closing, the world going sharp.

Before I can lock up completely, Sam’s voice cuts in, calm but firm. “No photos.”

The mom blinks. “I’m not taking pictures of the kids, just him.”

Sam doesn’t move. “No photos.”

Noel, bless his meddling heart, tries to smooth it over. “We have an official photographer later, darling!”

The mom’s smile thins. “It’s a public event.”

Sam’s tone stays flat. “Private boundary.”

The mom huffs like she’s been denied oxygen, but she lowers her phone.

I swallow hard, still shaky, and force myself to breathe.

Then I look at the lighthouse again because anger is easier than panic.

“This tower is going to collapse,” I say.

The mom scoffs. “No it won’t.”

I point. “That icing seam is under stress. The pretzel columns aren’t aligned. Your base is soft. It’s going to slide.”

Noel whispers, “He’s so hot right now,” like the world’s most inappropriate narrator.

I ignore him.

The mom crosses her arms. “It’s fine.”

I stare at her, deadpan. “Do you want to win or do you want a disaster in front of the town tree.”

Her nostrils flare. “It won’t collapse.”

As if summoned by spite, the tower makes a tiny, ominous crack.

Everyone goes still.

The mom’s eyes widen.

Noel gasps like he’s watching a murder.

I don’t move. “I told you.”

The tower leans.

A kid shrieks.

Sam moves instantly, stepping in with steady hands, catching the whole gingerbread structure before it can smash onto the table and explode into a candy massacre.

He holds it like it’s a live bomb, calm even as frosting smears onto his gloves.

The crowd erupts in laughter and applause.

The mom looks like she wants to disappear into the snow.

Noel grabs the mic and announces, “AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS WHY WE HAVE OFFICER ROOK!”

More cheering.

My heart is still pounding, but the panic has shifted into something else.

Gratitude, hot and inconvenient.

Sam sets the lighthouse down carefully, then looks at me.

His eyes are steady.

A quiet question.

*Still okay.*

I swallow and nod once.

“Yeah,” I say, rough.

Sam’s mouth tips, subtle. “Okay.”

I glare, but there’s no bite. “Stop.”

“No.”

---

By the time we finish judging, I’ve written three pages of notes and threatened four people with structural critiques. It’s almost… fun.

Noel reads out winners like it’s the Oscars.

Kids cheer. Parents clap. Hugh cries.

When Noel announces the kid-cottage as “Most Festive Spirit,” the kid looks at me like I’ve personally given him the sun.

I nod once, stiff and uncomfortable.

The kid beams anyway.

Then Noel announces the overall winner: the barn, which genuinely deserves it.

The PTA mom with the lighthouse tries to smile like she’s not fantasizing about arson.

Noel wraps things up, everyone disperses, and the tent empties into the cold.

I exhale like I’ve been holding my breath for three hours.

Sam steps closer, still careful about distance in public. “You were good.”

I scowl. “I was harsh.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “You were honest. And you didn’t run.”

My chest tightens.

I look away, because my face is doing something soft I don’t approve of. “Don’t make it a thing.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

Noel pops up between us like a demon. “You were AMAZING.”

I glare. “Noel.”

Noel holds up both hands. “No commentary. No teasing. Boundaries. I’m learning.”

I narrow my eyes. “Barely.”

Noel’s smile turns genuinely soft for half a second. “I’m proud of you.”

I hate that the words hit. I hate that they don’t feel like a trap.

I mutter, “Go away.”

Noel beams. “Festive!” and vanishes into the crowd.

Sam watches him go, then turns back to me, voice low. “Home.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

And we walk back to the bakery together, snow crunching under our boots, the town lights flickering like they’re trying to pretend everything is simple.

It isn’t.

But it’s… working.

Somehow.

---

## Chapter 8: The Gingerbread Afterglow

Back inside Candle & Crumb, warmth hits my face like relief.

I lock the door behind us and flip the sign.

CLOSED.

Sam takes off his gloves. Frosting smears on the leather like proof of what happened.

I stare at it, then at him.

“You caught it,” I say, because my brain can’t figure out how to say *thank you* without choking.

Sam’s voice is calm. “It was falling.”

“I mean,” I mutter, “you didn’t hesitate.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “Neither did you. You spoke.”

My throat tightens. “I was annoyed.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Still spoke.”

I exhale hard and pace two steps, then stop.

This is the part where my brain tries to turn everything into danger.

Because gratitude is vulnerability and vulnerability is risk.

Sam stays still, giving me space like he always does.

Finally I force it out, rough and real. “Thanks.”

Sam’s eyes soften immediately. “You’re welcome.”

My chest aches.

I look away fast, then mutter, “Also you have frosting on your gloves.”

Sam glances down. “Yeah.”

“It’s… stupidly attractive,” I say before I can stop myself.

Silence.

I go cold.

Sam’s brows lift slightly, surprise and warmth flickering. “Is it.”

I scrub a hand over my face. “Don’t make me regret talking.”

Sam’s voice stays low. “Okay.”

I point at him. “Stop.”

“No.”

He steps closer, slow and careful, giving me time to flinch.

I don’t.

He stops just inside my space, gaze steady. “Still okay.”

My throat tightens. “Yes.”

Sam’s mouth meets mine, warm and unhurried, and the kiss is like a reset. Like the world outside can be loud and invasive, but in here, he’s still asking.

I kiss him back hard enough to make my own knees go weak.

He pulls back a fraction. “Slow.”

I exhale, shaking. “Yes. Slow.”

We move together toward the back room, the bakery dim, the ovens humming like they’re amused at my lack of self-control.

Sam’s hands hover at my waist, waiting.

I nod once.

He touches me, gentle, and my whole body loosens like it’s been waiting all day.

I hate how much I need this.

I love that he gives it without taking more than I offer.

When he checks in, I answer.

When I get tight, he slows.

When I finally break, it’s into warmth instead of panic.

After, we end up sitting on the prep counter, boots dangling, breathing in the quiet.

Sam’s shoulder rests near mine, not pressing, just there.

I stare at the floor and mutter, “This is not sustainable.”

Sam’s brows lift. “What.”

“Feeling okay,” I say, voice rough. “It’s suspicious.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I sigh. “Stop.”

“No.”

I swallow, then admit the truth I don’t want to admit. “I liked today.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Yeah?”

“I didn’t hate it,” I correct.

Sam’s eyes soften. “That’s a win.”

My throat tightens.

I stare at him, then look away like eye contact might break me.

Sam’s voice stays low. “Tomorrow’s Day Seven.”

I groan. “What is it.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Ice sculpture walk.”

I freeze. “No.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Yes.”

“I will slip and die,” I mutter.

Sam’s voice is calm. “I’ll catch you.”

My chest tightens, warm and annoyed. “Don’t say things like that.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “Why.”

“Because,” I mutter, “I might believe you.”

Sam goes quiet for a beat, then asks softly, “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

He nods once like it matters.

It does.

Outside, the town keeps glowing.

Inside, for once, I’m not bracing for impact.

I’m… leaning.

And that’s the scariest part of all.

---

## Chapter 9: Ice and Other Bad Ideas

Day Seven arrives with fresh snow and an ice sculpture walk, because Noel has never met a situation he couldn’t make colder and more public.

By the time we hit Evergreen Square, the sculptures are lined up like glittering traps: swans, reindeer, a dragon (of course), a ridiculously detailed “Santa’s sleigh” that looks like it could cut someone.

Tourists drift through taking photos.

I tense.

Sam stays near, not touching, but present.

Noel bounces ahead, shouting fun facts like a tour guide in hell.

“THIS ONE IS A POLAR BEAR,” Noel announces. “SYMBOLIZING RESILIENCE!”

Eben murmurs, “It is ice.”

Hugh whispers, “It’s ephemeral art.”

I’m walking carefully, because the paths are slick and my dignity is fragile.

Sam glances at me. “You want my arm.”

I freeze. “No.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I take one step.

My boot slides.

My stomach drops.

Sam’s hand shoots out and catches my elbow, steady and fast, preventing me from eating snow in front of half the town.

His grip is light. Not possessive. Just… saving me.

My face heats instantly.

A tourist laughs softly, not cruel, just amused by the near-slip.

My chest tightens.

Sam releases me immediately, respect snapping back into place.

He leans in, voice low. “Still okay.”

I swallow hard.

The old Wes would’ve snapped, would’ve yanked away, would’ve turned it into anger to hide the embarrassment.

Today, my chest is tight, but I can breathe.

“Yeah,” I say, rough. “I’m okay.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I glare weakly. “Stop.”

“No.”

And then Noel turns around, sees us, and his eyes light up like he’s about to ruin everything.

So, naturally, I brace for impact.

Because this town might be cozy, but it is relentless.

And I’m still learning how to stand in the light without burning.

(Keep going.)



## Chapter 9: Ice and Other Bad Ideas (continued)

Noel turns around, spots Sam’s hand having just saved my dignity, and his face lights up like he’s about to set my life on fire for sport.

“Oh!” Noel says, too loud. “LOOK AT THAT. SAFETY. TEAMWORK. TRUST.”

I go still.

Sam’s posture doesn’t change, but his voice goes calm and flat in the way that means he’s done playing. “Noel.”

Noel blinks, mid-gush. “Yes?”

Sam holds his gaze. “Don’t.”

Noel’s smile wobbles. The performative sparkle dims a notch. “Right. Boundaries. I’m learning.”

Eben appears like a summoned consequence. “Stop talking.”

Hugh whispers, delighted, “Aromantic tension.”

Eben turns his head slowly. “Leave.”

Hugh leaves, but not far enough.

Noel clears his throat and pivots hard, pointing at the nearest sculpture like it’s a distraction grenade. “THIS ONE IS A… VERY FESTIVE FISH.”

“It’s a swan,” Eben says.

Noel nods emphatically. “A SWAN-FISH.”

I exhale through my nose, trying not to laugh because laughter is dangerous. Laughter turns into softness and softness turns into people thinking they can touch your life.

Sam glances at me, quick and steady.

“Still okay,” he murmurs.

My chest is tight, but it’s not panic-tight. It’s… awareness-tight. The kind that happens when you realize the world could take something and someone might block it for you.

I swallow. “Yeah.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Okay.”

I glare weakly. “Stop.”

“No.”

We keep walking.

The path is slick. The ice sculptures glitter. Tourists raise phones. My body keeps tensing every time I see a camera angle toward us.

Sam tracks it without making it a spectacle. He subtly shifts where he stands so I’m not the obvious subject. He slows when I slow. He pauses when I pause, like he’s matching my nervous system instead of forcing his own pace.

It’s infuriatingly competent.

Noel keeps chirping facts no one asked for. “THIS REINDEER IS SYMBOLIC OF—”

Eben says, “No.”

Noel keeps going anyway.

Then a tourist, phone held high, steps backward without looking and bumps straight into me.

My boot skids.

The world tilts.

My stomach drops.

Sam’s hand catches my forearm immediately. Firm. Steady. No hesitation.

The tourist turns, startled. “Oh my gosh, sorry!”

Sam releases me the second my balance returns, like his touch is a tool, not a claim.

I stand there, cheeks hot, heart thudding.

The tourist’s eyes flick between us with interest. The kind of interest that turns into stories.

I feel the old reflex spike: *Run. Bite. Burn.*

Sam’s voice is calm and neutral. “No worries. Watch your step.”

The tourist nods rapidly and hurries away.

Noel, of course, sees the entire thing and makes a delighted noise like a gremlin.

I shoot him a look.

Noel clamps his lips shut so hard it looks painful.

Progress.

Sam leans in slightly, voice low. “You want my arm.”

I go rigid. “No.”

Sam’s eyes warm, patient. “Okay.”

I take a careful breath. The path ahead is worse. A sheen of ice. People milling. Cameras everywhere. If I fall, it will be a public spectacle. If I don’t fall, I’ll still spend the next hour bracing.

My chest tightens.

I hate the next part, because it makes this my choice.

I swallow hard and say, very quietly, “Not your arm.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “Okay.”

I exhale. “Just… walk closer.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Close.”

I glare at him. “Don’t make it cute.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

He steps closer, still not touching, but near enough that my brain stops screaming about open space.

We walk like that for the rest of the sculpture line. Parallel. Controlled. Normal enough that no one points.

The world doesn’t end.

Which is suspicious.

By the time Noel declares the walk “a triumph of civic artistry,” I’m exhausted in that strange way that comes from holding yourself together in public.

Sam looks at me, assessing without judgment. “Home.”

I nod once. “Home.”

Noel claps like he’s just watched me complete an obstacle course. “Wes did it! He didn’t even die!”

“I almost did,” I mutter.

Noel beams. “Almost doesn’t count!”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Noel.”

Noel zips his lips again, then points at the schedule board nearby like he can’t help himself. “Tomorrow is Day Eight!”

I don’t like how my body reacts to “tomorrow” now. Not dread, exactly. More like… anticipation with claws.

I mutter, “What is it.”

Noel’s eyes sparkle. “Ice rink charity night.”

I freeze.

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Skating.”

I whisper, horrified, “I will die.”

Noel beams. “You will wobble. And it will be adorable.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “He can say no.”

Noel’s smile softens a notch. “He can.”

I stare at Noel like he’s grown a second head.

Noel shrugs. “I’m learning.”

I hate it. I also… don’t hate it.

I swallow and force the words out. “I’ll go.”

Noel brightens like a thousand suns. “YES!”

Sam’s gaze flicks to me, steady. “You chose it.”

I grit my teeth. “Don’t make it a thing.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

And my chest tightens again, warm and inconvenient, because I’m starting to understand something I never wanted to learn:

Choice doesn’t trap you.

Choice sets you free.

Which is a disgusting inspirational thought, and I’m going to pretend I didn’t have it.

## Chapter 10: The Rink

The ice rink is set up in Evergreen Square like a dare.

String lights hang overhead. Music plays from speakers that crackle like they’re haunted. A little booth sells cocoa and rental skates. Kids zip around like they were born with blades on their feet.

I stand at the edge, staring at the ice like it personally insulted me.

Noel bounces beside me wearing earmuffs shaped like reindeer. “Isn’t it magical?”

“It’s a trap,” I say.

Sam stands nearby, on duty but not looming, calm as a snowdrift. He watches the crowd. He watches the perimeter. He watches me like he’s tracking weather patterns.

“You don’t have to skate,” he says.

I glare. “Noel will force me.”

Noel gasps. “I would never force you.”

I stare at him.

Noel smiles brightly. “I would only *encourage* you with guilt.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Noel.”

Noel puts a hand to his chest. “Boundaries. Fine. No guilt. Only… gentle peer pressure.”

Sam’s gaze goes flat. “Noel.”

Noel zips his lips and prances away toward the cocoa booth.

I look at the skates. The blades. The laces. The inevitability of humiliation.

I exhale. “I can’t do this.”

Sam’s eyes are steady. “What part.”

“All of it,” I snap, then regret the snap because Sam doesn’t deserve my teeth.

Sam doesn’t flinch. “Okay. Then we don’t.”

The simplicity of it makes my throat tighten.

I swallow hard. “But I said I’d go.”

Sam nods once. “You went. You’re here. That’s already a public step.”

My chest tightens.

He’s right. And I hate that he’s right, because it means this doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing.

I look at the ice again. Kids laughing. Couples holding hands. People being normal about touch like it’s not a weapon.

I swallow. “I could… try. Ten minutes.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Okay. Ten.”

I narrow my eyes. “That okay counts.”

“It counts,” he says, mouth tipping slightly.

Noel materializes with two cups of cocoa like a summoned devil. “Courage juice.”

I take it and mutter, “If I fall, I’m suing.”

Noel beams. “Sign the waiver in your heart.”

I glare.

Noel backs away, hands up. “I’m silent.”

He is not silent, but he leaves.

Sam gestures toward the skate booth. “Rental.”

I stare. “You’re doing this.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “You chose ten minutes.”

I grind my teeth and march to the booth like I’m going to war.

The teenager behind the counter looks me up and down. “Size?”

“Hell,” I mutter.

Sam’s mouth tips. “Twelve.”

I shoot him a look.

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “You’re a twelve.”

I hate that he knows that.

I hate more that he’s right.

Ten minutes later, I’m standing on the ice in rental skates that feel like torture devices.

My ankles are screaming. My dignity has filed for divorce.

I clutch the railing with both hands.

Sam steps onto the ice smoothly, balanced and calm, like gravity likes him.

He stops a careful distance away. “You want help.”

“No,” I snap automatically.

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I take one step.

My blade skitters.

I grab the railing harder.

Sam doesn’t laugh. Doesn’t comment. Just waits.

I hate waiting. Waiting makes me admit things.

I swallow hard. “How do you… do it.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Small steps. Bend your knees. Keep your center low.”

“Low,” I repeat, like I’m reading instructions for disarming a bomb.

Sam’s eyes warm. “Yeah.”

I bend my knees slightly. Take another step. Another.

I move like a newborn deer.

Noel, somewhere nearby, makes an excited squeak.

I glare at him from across the rink.

Noel pretends he’s looking at the tree.

Sam skates backward slowly, facing me, matching my pace. “You’re doing it.”

I scowl. “I’m surviving.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Same thing.”

I take another step.

Then a kid zips past too close, clipping my skate.

My foot shoots out.

My stomach drops.

This is it. Public death.

Sam moves instantly, catching me by the elbow. Firm. Steady. No panic.

I clutch his sleeve on reflex.

He stabilizes me, then pauses.

His grip loosens slightly, waiting.

Asking.

I breathe hard. My heart is pounding. My hand is still on his sleeve.

This is… touching.

In public.

My chest tightens like a wire being pulled.

Sam’s voice is low. “Still okay.”

I swallow.

The old Wes wants to jerk away and make a joke and pretend this never happened.

But I’m upright. I’m safe. And the contact is… grounding, not claiming.

I can feel the warmth of his arm through fabric.

I hate how much my body settles.

I whisper, rough, “Yes.”

Sam’s gaze warms, careful. “Okay.”

I don’t let go immediately.

That’s the smallest rebellion against my own fear I’ve ever committed.

Then I release his sleeve and grip the railing again, like I didn’t just do something huge.

Sam doesn’t make it a thing. He just says, low, “We can do the rest with a handhold if you want. For balance.”

My stomach flips.

Handhold. Public. Visible.

I stare at him. “People will talk.”

Sam nods, honest. “Yes.”

I swallow hard. “I don’t want to be… discussed.”

Sam’s eyes soften. “Then we don’t. You can keep the railing. Or we can leave.”

Choice again.

I hate choice. Choice makes me responsible for my own courage.

I glance around. People laughing. Kids skating. Noel pretending not to watch while watching like it’s his religion. Eben standing off the ice with his arms crossed like he’s prepared to throw hands at the concept of fun.

No one is staring at me. Not really. Not yet.

I exhale slowly.

“Not a handhold,” I whisper.

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “Okay.”

I grit my teeth. “Just… two fingers. Like a… safety tether. Not romantic.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Two fingers.”

I glare. “Stop smiling.”

“I’m not,” he says, absolutely lying.

He glides closer, slow, and holds out his hand palm-up like an offering.

I stare at it like it’s a live wire.

Then I do the bravest, dumbest thing I’ve done all week.

I place two fingers into his palm.

Not my whole hand. Not a grip. Just… contact.

Sam’s fingers curl lightly around mine, careful and controlled, and my chest tightens so hard it almost hurts.

He starts moving, slow, guiding me away from the railing.

I take small steps. He matches me. Two fingers between us like a secret.

My pulse is roaring.

But I’m skating. Barely. Still.

And I’m not falling.

And for the first time, “public” doesn’t feel like a firing squad.

It feels like… air.

Noel lets out a sound like he’s going to explode.

Eben barks, “NOEL.”

Noel clamps his mouth shut and vibrates with restrained joy.

Sam leans in slightly, voice low. “Still okay.”

I breathe hard, eyes stinging for no reason I’m willing to admit.

“Yeah,” I whisper. “I’m okay.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

And we glide, slowly, under the lights, two fingers at a time.

Not a declaration.

Not a label.

Just a choice.

Just me, learning that maybe being seen doesn’t have to mean being taken.

---

## Chapter 11: After

By the time my ten minutes are up, my legs feel like I’ve fought a bear.

I wobble back to the edge, release Sam’s hand, and step off the ice like I’m escaping a battlefield.

Noel practically sprints over. “YOU DID IT.”

I glare. “Volume.”

Noel covers his mouth, eyes shining. “Sorry. Sorry. I’m normal.”

He is not normal.

Sam steps off the ice after me, calm as ever, and my body immediately misses the tiny tether like it’s gotten used to something it shouldn’t.

I hate that.

Sam’s gaze flicks to me. “You did good.”

I scowl. “I did two fingers.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Two fingers is still a choice.”

My chest tightens.

Noel whispers, “Two fingers,” like he’s going to write poetry about it.

Eben appears behind Noel and says, deadpan, “Stop.”

Noel stops.

Sam’s voice goes low, for me only. “You want to go.”

I swallow. The rink is still loud, still bright, still public.

I’m proud in a way that makes me want to throw up.

“Yes,” I say. “Home.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I glare, softer. “Stop.”

“No,” he says, and it sounds like warmth instead of defiance.

We walk back through the snow toward Candle & Crumb.

And it’s stupid, but my fingers still feel the memory of his.

Like my body is keeping proof.

Like I might actually be changing.

Which is inconvenient.

But… not awful.

Not anymore.



## Chapter 9: Ice and Other Bad Ideas (continued)

Noel turns around, spots Sam’s hand having just saved my dignity, and his face lights up like he’s about to set my life on fire for sport.

“Oh!” Noel says, too loud. “LOOK AT THAT. SAFETY. TEAMWORK. TRUST.”

I go still.

Sam’s posture doesn’t change, but his voice goes calm and flat in the way that means he’s done playing. “Noel.”

Noel blinks, mid-gush. “Yes?”

Sam holds his gaze. “Don’t.”

Noel’s smile wobbles. The performative sparkle dims a notch. “Right. Boundaries. I’m learning.”

Eben appears like a summoned consequence. “Stop talking.”

Hugh whispers, delighted, “Aromantic tension.”

Eben turns his head slowly. “Leave.”

Hugh leaves, but not far enough.

Noel clears his throat and pivots hard, pointing at the nearest sculpture like it’s a distraction grenade. “THIS ONE IS A… VERY FESTIVE FISH.”

“It’s a swan,” Eben says.

Noel nods emphatically. “A SWAN-FISH.”

I exhale through my nose, trying not to laugh because laughter is dangerous. Laughter turns into softness and softness turns into people thinking they can touch your life.

Sam glances at me, quick and steady.

“Still okay,” he murmurs.

My chest is tight, but it’s not panic-tight. It’s… awareness-tight. The kind that happens when you realize the world could take something and someone might block it for you.

I swallow. “Yeah.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Okay.”

I glare weakly. “Stop.”

“No.”

We keep walking.

The path is slick. The ice sculptures glitter. Tourists raise phones. My body keeps tensing every time I see a camera angle toward us.

Sam tracks it without making it a spectacle. He subtly shifts where he stands so I’m not the obvious subject. He slows when I slow. He pauses when I pause, like he’s matching my nervous system instead of forcing his own pace.

It’s infuriatingly competent.

Noel keeps chirping facts no one asked for. “THIS REINDEER IS SYMBOLIC OF—”

Eben says, “No.”

Noel keeps going anyway.

Then a tourist, phone held high, steps backward without looking and bumps straight into me.

My boot skids.

The world tilts.

My stomach drops.

Sam’s hand catches my forearm immediately. Firm. Steady. No hesitation.

The tourist turns, startled. “Oh my gosh, sorry!”

Sam releases me the second my balance returns, like his touch is a tool, not a claim.

I stand there, cheeks hot, heart thudding.

The tourist’s eyes flick between us with interest. The kind of interest that turns into stories.

I feel the old reflex spike: *Run. Bite. Burn.*

Sam’s voice is calm and neutral. “No worries. Watch your step.”

The tourist nods rapidly and hurries away.

Noel, of course, sees the entire thing and makes a delighted noise like a gremlin.

I shoot him a look.

Noel clamps his lips shut so hard it looks painful.

Progress.

Sam leans in slightly, voice low. “You want my arm.”

I go rigid. “No.”

Sam’s eyes warm, patient. “Okay.”

I take a careful breath. The path ahead is worse. A sheen of ice. People milling. Cameras everywhere. If I fall, it will be a public spectacle. If I don’t fall, I’ll still spend the next hour bracing.

My chest tightens.

I hate the next part, because it makes this my choice.

I swallow hard and say, very quietly, “Not your arm.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “Okay.”

I exhale. “Just… walk closer.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Close.”

I glare at him. “Don’t make it cute.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

He steps closer, still not touching, but near enough that my brain stops screaming about open space.

We walk like that for the rest of the sculpture line. Parallel. Controlled. Normal enough that no one points.

The world doesn’t end.

Which is suspicious.

By the time Noel declares the walk “a triumph of civic artistry,” I’m exhausted in that strange way that comes from holding yourself together in public.

I don’t like how my body reacts to “tomorrow” now. Not dread, exactly. More like… anticipation with claws.

I mutter, “What is it.”

Noel’s eyes sparkle. “Ice rink charity night.”

I freeze.

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Skating.”

I whisper, horrified, “I will die.”

Noel beams. “You will wobble. And it will be adorable.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “He can say no.”

Noel’s smile softens a notch. “He can.”

I stare at Noel like he’s grown a second head.

Noel shrugs. “I’m learning.”

I hate it. I also… don’t hate it.

I swallow and force the words out. “I’ll go.”

And it’s stupid, but my fingers still feel the memory of his.

Like my body is keeping proof.

Like I might actually be changing.

Which is inconvenient.

But… not awful.

Not anymore.



## Chapter 12: Two Fingers, Two Truths

The walk back to Candle & Crumb is quiet in the way that makes my brain want to start inventing problems.

Snow crunches under my boots. The lights in the square fade behind us. The rink music becomes a muffled thump, like the town’s heartbeat finally leaving my ear.

Sam matches my pace without trying to steer me.

Which is, infuriatingly, perfect.

I shove my hands into my coat pockets. My fingers are still buzzing like they’ve been holding a live wire.

Two fingers.

That’s all it was.

And somehow it feels like I just walked into traffic and survived.

Sam glances over, voice low. “You did more than you planned.”

I scowl. “I did exactly ten minutes.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “And the tether.”

I glare. “Don’t call it that.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

“Stop.”

“No.”

We reach the bakery. I unlock the door, flip the sign, and let us into the warm quiet like it’s a sanctuary.

My shoulders drop the second the door shuts.

Sam notices. Of course he does.

He takes off his coat. Sets it neatly on the chair. Not like a guest, exactly. Not like he owns the place either. Just… respectful presence.

I don’t know what to do with that.

I clear my throat and default to what I know. “Tea.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I shoot him a look. “You’re doing it again.”

He doesn’t even pretend innocence. “Yes.”

I put the kettle on and fuss with mugs so I don’t have to process how my chest keeps tightening every time he exists near me.

Sam watches me for a beat. “You’re quiet.”

“I’m tired,” I say.

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “And.”

I grip the mug too hard. “And I hate that I… liked it.”

Sam doesn’t move closer. Doesn’t pounce on the vulnerability like a greedy animal. He just nods once like I told him I prefer my coffee black.

“You’re allowed,” he says.

I scoff. “Allowed.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “To like something. To be seen. To not hate every part of it.”

My throat tightens.

I hate that my eyes sting. It’s humiliating.

I scrub a hand over my face. “Don’t psychoanalyze me.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I point at him without looking. “Stop.”

“No.”

I pour hot water into mugs. Steam rises. The smell of chamomile fills the space like an attempt at peace.

We sit at the small table in the back, because the front of the bakery still feels like the public world even when it’s empty.

Sam wraps his hands around the mug. “Two fingers,” he says, voice careful.

I flinch.

Sam immediately softens. “Not teasing.”

I swallow. “Okay.”

His mouth tips. “That okay counts.”

I glare. “You’re both ruining language and my life.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Do you regret it.”

I freeze.

Because the answer should be complicated. Because I’m me. Because I don’t trust good things.

But my body remembers standing on the ice, terrified, and then not falling because someone steady was there.

I exhale slowly. “No.”

Sam nods once, like he’s storing it somewhere safe. “Okay.”

I glare out of habit. “Stop.”

“No,” he says, and it’s softer now, less teasing, more… anchored.

I stare at my mug. “It felt… safe.”

Sam’s expression shifts. Not triumph. Not smugness. Just something quiet and serious. “Good.”

My chest tightens harder. “That’s not normal for me.”

Sam’s voice stays low. “I know.”

I look up sharply. “How.”

Sam meets my gaze. “Because you keep telling me what’s hard. And because I watch you brace every time someone looks at you too long.”

My throat tightens. I hate being read like this.

I hate more that it feels like relief.

I whisper, rough, “I don’t want you to think you have to fix it.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “I’m not fixing you.”

I blink.

Sam continues, calm and firm. “I’m just here. You’re the one choosing.”

My chest aches.

Choice again.

Always that.

I swallow. “So what happens now.”

Sam leans back slightly, giving space even while answering. “Tomorrow happens. The festival happens. And we keep doing what works.”

I frown. “What works.”

Sam’s voice is quiet. “Consent. Plans. Space. And… small public steps you choose.”

I stare at him, throat tight.

Then I say the thing I didn’t plan to say. “Do you… want more.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly, careful. “More what.”

I swallow hard. “Not just… the festival.”

Sam goes still, like he doesn’t want to scare the question away.

His voice is low. “Yes.”

My chest tightens like a trap snapping shut, except it doesn’t feel like danger. It feels like standing on ice and realizing you can balance.

I whisper, “That’s inconvenient.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare weakly. “Stop.”

“No.”

We sit there with the truth between us, warm and terrifying.

Then my phone buzzes.

Because humans can’t have a single quiet emotional breakthrough without technology trying to ruin it.

I glance at the screen.

**UNKNOWN NUMBER:** Still think you can control the narrative?
**UNKNOWN NUMBER:** Cute.
**UNKNOWN NUMBER:** Article drops tomorrow morning.

My stomach goes cold.

My throat closes.

My hands go numb around the mug.

Sam’s posture shifts instantly. “What.”

I swallow. “Grant.”

Sam’s eyes narrow. “He texted you.”

I nod once, shaky.

Sam holds his hand out, palm-up. Not demanding. Asking.

I hesitate, then hand him the phone.

He reads the messages, jaw tightening.

When he looks back up, his voice is calm, but there’s steel under it. “Okay.”

I flinch. “That okay is not comforting.”

Sam sets the phone down gently. “Then here’s the comforting part: we handle it. Together.”

My throat tightens. “I don’t want the town reading about me.”

Sam nods, honest. “I know.”

I whisper, “What if he makes it… a thing.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “Then we don’t feed it.”

My chest aches. “What if he posts a photo.”

Sam’s voice stays steady. “If he took one without consent, we address it.”

I shake my head, panic rising. “I can’t do this.”

Sam leans forward slightly, still not touching. “Still okay.”

I swallow hard. My chest is tight, the panic licking at my ribs.

But I’m here. In my bakery. With him.

I breathe in, shaky.

“No,” I whisper. “But… I’m here.”

Sam nods once. “Good. Then we start there.”

## Chapter 13: The Article

Morning comes too fast, as usual.

I open the bakery like I always do, because routine is my religion. The ovens hum. The air warms. The world tries to be normal.

It fails.

At 6:12 a.m., Noel bursts in, face pale, phone in hand.

“Oh no,” Noel whispers.

My stomach drops. “What.”

Noel holds the phone out like he’s presenting a corpse.

On the screen is a headline from some regional lifestyle site that thinks it’s important:

**TINSEL TOWN’S FESTIVAL OF LOVE: SMALL-TOWN MAGIC AND A BAKER’S MELT-DOWN**

My vision goes sharp.

“Festival of love,” I say flatly. “He wrote that.”

Noel nods, stricken. “He wrote that.”

My throat tightens. “Read it.”

Noel scrolls, eyes darting, voice quiet. “He calls Candle & Crumb ‘the beating heart of Tinsel Town.’ He describes the cookie exchange. He mentions your ‘strict standards’ at the gingerbread contest.”

I swallow. “Any photos.”

Noel scrolls again, face tightening. “No photos of you. Just… the bakery storefront. The tent. The tree. But…”

He hesitates.

“But what,” I snap.

Noel swallows. “He describes you as ‘icy,’ ‘guarded,’ and… ‘mysteriously close with the town’s most eligible officer.’”

My chest goes cold.

The room tilts.

I grip the counter. “He did not.”

Noel’s eyes shine with anger now, real anger. “He did.”

My stomach churns. The panic spikes, hot and fast. Not because it’s a secret exactly. Because it’s *mine.* Because someone took something I didn’t offer and tried to sell it.

The door chimes.

Sam steps in, calm but alert, like he sensed the weather shift.

He takes one look at my face and Noel’s and goes still.

“What,” Sam says, voice low.

Noel shoves the phone at him.

Sam reads.

His jaw tightens.

When he looks up, his voice is calm enough to be terrifying. “Okay.”

I shake my head, breathing hard. “I can’t.”

Sam sets the phone down gently, then looks at me, steady. “He didn’t post your photo.”

I swallow. “He still… wrote about me.”

Sam nods. “Yes.”

My throat tightens. “People will talk.”

Sam nods again, honest. “Yes.”

I stare at him, furious at how calm he stays when my insides are on fire. “So what do we do.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “We do what you wanted. Neutral. No fuel.”

Noel splutters. “But it’s unfair!”

Sam looks at Noel, calm but firm. “It is. And reacting publicly will feed it.”

Noel’s hands curl into fists. “So we just let him.”

Sam’s voice stays even. “We document. We deal with him through the right channels. And we keep Wes safe.”

The word *safe* hits me like a bruise.

My throat tightens. “I don’t want to be handled.”

Sam’s gaze softens immediately. “Okay. Then: we keep you in control.”

I swallow hard.

Noel exhales, shaky. “I can mobilize the town. We can boycott. We can—”

I snap, “Noel, stop.”

Noel freezes.

I force myself to breathe, slow. “No war. No spectacle.”

Noel’s eyes widen. “But he hurt you.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Saying it out loud makes my chest ache.

Sam’s voice is low. “You want to keep it small.”

I nod once, shaky. “Small.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

Noel looks between us, then slowly nods too, swallowing his anger. “Okay. Small.”

I stare at the ovens and try to remember how to be a person.

Sam steps closer, careful. “Back room.”

I whisper, “Yes.”

---

In the back, the quiet hits like a wall.

My hands shake. I press them flat to the counter.

Sam stands a few feet away, giving space, voice low. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “No.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I glare at him through the panic. “Stop saying okay like it fixes anything.”

Sam’s eyes warm, serious. “It doesn’t fix it. It anchors it.”

My throat tightens.

I whisper, rough, “I feel like… everyone’s allowed to have an opinion on me.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “They’re not.”

“But they will,” I say, voice cracking. “They always do.”

Sam nods, honest. “Yes.”

I squeeze my eyes shut. “I hate this.”

Sam’s voice lowers. “I know.”

Silence stretches.

Then Sam says, steady, “Do you want to shut the bakery today.”

My chest tightens.

Closing feels like losing.

But staying open feels like standing in the street.

I swallow hard. “No. I want… normal.”

Sam nods once. “Okay. Then I stay nearby.”

I blink. “You can’t just… linger.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “I can be on patrol.”

I exhale, shaky laugh. “You’re ridiculous.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I huff. “Stop.”

“No.”

I wipe my face hard and force myself to stand upright.

My voice is rough. “If anyone says something, I will bite.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “Then I redirect.”

I swallow. “Neutral.”

Sam nods. “Neutral.”

I breathe in, shaky, and nod toward the door. “Let’s go.”

---

The morning rush comes.

People file in.

And the miracle is: most of them act normal.

Mrs. Alden orders her usual and pretends she’s not burning with questions. A couple of tourists buy cinnamon rolls and leave. A kid asks if we have sprinkles.

Normal.

Then, inevitably, someone tests it.

A woman I don’t know, phone in hand, leans toward the counter with a too-bright smile.

“I read the article,” she says. “You’re famous!”

My stomach drops.

I feel my teeth sharpen.

Sam shifts subtly at my side, present but not crowding.

I take a slow breath.

Neutral.

“No,” I say flatly. “I’m a baker.”

The woman blinks. “But it said—”

Sam’s voice cuts in, calm. “He’s working. Please order or step aside.”

The woman flushes, startled, and mutters an order.

I ring it up. Hand over the bag. Transaction. Done.

My hands are still shaking, but I didn’t explode.

Sam glances at me, quick check. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

And the word feels like power instead of denial.

---

## Chapter 14: Candlelight

That night, the festival has a candlelight walk.

Noel calls it “a gentle moment of collective warmth.” Eben calls it “a fire hazard.” I call it “public emotional terrorism.”

But I show up anyway, because apparently I’m making terrible choices now.

Evergreen Square glows with tiny lights. People hold candles in paper cups. The air is cold enough to sting.

I stand near the edge of the crowd, hood up, hands in pockets, trying to be invisible.

Sam is there, on duty, scanning the perimeter.

He spots me and starts to move toward me, then pauses like he’s remembering the rules.

No touching.

No spectacle.

He stops a careful distance away, close enough that my body settles anyway.

Noel appears like an angel with a clipboard. “You came.”

I glare. “Don’t.”

Noel holds up both hands. “No commentary. Boundaries.”

Eben stands nearby, arms crossed, watching the crowd like he’s prepared to punch gossip in the mouth.

The mayor says a few words. People murmur. Candles flicker.

Then the crowd starts walking, slow, a river of light through the square.

I walk too, at the edge.

Halfway through, someone near me whispers to their friend, “That’s him. The baker.”

My stomach drops.

The old panic flares.

Sam’s voice goes low, for me only. “Keep walking.”

I swallow and do.

Another whisper. “And that’s the officer.”

My chest tightens.

Sam shifts slightly closer, not touching, but aligning himself between me and the worst angles of the crowd.

Neutral.

No fuel.

We keep walking.

And then, without warning, a gust of wind blows through the square and snuffs a cluster of candles.

Someone yelps.

The crowd stutters.

In the confusion, a kid stumbles toward me, candle tilting dangerously.

Instinct hits.

I reach out, steady the kid’s candle cup so it doesn’t spill wax. My hand brushes the kid’s glove.

The kid looks up, wide-eyed. “Thanks!”

A couple of adults nearby see it. Smile. Not nosy. Just… human.

My chest tightens in a new way.

Because that’s being seen too.

And it’s not awful.

Sam’s voice is low beside me. “Still okay.”

I swallow hard.

Then I do something reckless.

I answer with truth, not armor.

“Yeah,” I whisper. “I’m okay.”

Sam nods once, and for a second, his hand hovers near mine in the dark, not touching, asking.

A choice.

My heart pounds.

I look around. Candles. Darkness. People focused forward. No one staring.

And I’m so tired of living like every gentle thing is a trap.

I inhale, then slide my gloved hand into his.

Not two fingers.

A full hand.

For one steady, silent beat.

Sam’s hand closes around mine, careful and warm, like he understands the weight of what I just did.

Then, before the moment can become a story for anyone else, I let go.

I keep walking.

My heart is roaring.

Sam doesn’t react. Doesn’t smile. Doesn’t squeeze like a claim.

He just stays near, like he always does.

And my chest aches, not with panic.

With something that feels dangerously like hope.

So, naturally, I hate it.

But I keep walking anyway.




## Chapter 15: Handprint

I let go of Sam’s hand and keep walking like I didn’t just do something that would’ve made Old Me spontaneously combust.

The candlelight river keeps moving. People murmur softly. Someone laughs up ahead. The world pretends it’s gentle and harmless, like it hasn’t spent my whole life proving otherwise.

My palm still remembers his.

Sam stays close, not touching, not pressing, just… there. Like he understands the rule: if you make it a thing, it becomes a thing. And then the town owns it.

We finish the walk. People blow out candles. Noel cries a little because Noel treats shared oxygen like a spiritual experience.

Eben stands in the snow looking like he wants to arrest sentimentality.

The crowd disperses.

And somehow, no one stops me.

No one corners me with a question. No one asks if the baker and the officer are “together” like it’s their business. No one reaches for their phone like I’m content.

My nervous system doesn’t know what to do with that.

I walk back toward the bakery, boots crunching, shoulders tight, heart still hammering.

Sam keeps pace beside me, still not touching.

Halfway there, he says quietly, “You did that.”

I stare straight ahead. “Did what.”

Sam’s voice stays low. “Chose it.”

My throat tightens, hot and stupid. “It was one second.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “One second is still a choice.”

I hate him for saying it like it’s not terrifying.

I mutter, “Don’t make it inspirational.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Okay.”

I point at him without looking. “Stop.”

“No.”

We reach Candle & Crumb. I unlock the door and let us in, warmth hitting my face like relief.

I lock it behind us.

The quiet of the bakery settles around my shoulders.

Sam takes off his coat. Hangs it neatly. The routine of him here makes my chest ache in a way I don’t want to interrogate.

I clear my throat. “Tea.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I glare. “You’re enjoying that word too much.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Yes.”

I make tea because it gives my hands something to do besides shake.

We end up in the back again, mugs steaming, the world outside muffled.

I stare at my cup for a long time, then finally mutter, “I didn’t mean to.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “You didn’t mean to hold my hand.”

“I meant to,” I correct immediately, because I’m not a liar. “I didn’t mean to… do it where it mattered.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “It mattered because you chose it.”

My throat tightens. I look away, annoyed at the sting behind my eyes.

“I hate that it mattered,” I mutter.

Sam’s voice stays steady. “Why.”

“Because,” I say, rough, “if it matters, then the next part matters. And then the part after that. And suddenly I’m… visible.”

Sam nods once, like he’s heard this a thousand times already from the way my body flinches. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

Silence stretches.

Then Sam says quietly, “Do you want to talk about the article.”

My stomach drops.

I swallow hard. “No.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

My chest tightens. “But we have to.”

Sam’s gaze is calm. “We do. When you’re ready.”

I hate that he gives me time. Time makes me responsible for my own courage.

I take a slow breath.

“Tomorrow,” I say. “We deal with it tomorrow.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

I sip tea and stare at nothing for a minute, then hear myself say, “I didn’t hate tonight.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Good.”

I swallow. “I also didn’t hate… the hand.”

Sam goes still, careful. “Okay.”

I glare reflexively. “Don’t you dare make a face.”

Sam’s mouth tips, faint. “I’m not.”

He is. The liar.

I exhale. “Still okay.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly, warmed. “Yes.”

And in that stupid moment, with tea and warm light and the ovens humming like they’re eavesdropping, I realize something awful:

I’m starting to trust that “yes.”

Which is, frankly, terrible for my brand.

---

## Chapter 16: The Plan

Morning comes with snow and consequences.

Noel arrives at 6:30 a.m. like a man who has not slept and has instead been possessed by civic rage.

He slams his phone on the counter. “We are not letting this stand.”

I don’t look at it. “Noel.”

Noel points at the screen anyway. “He updated it! He added a line about ‘holiday romance blooming under twinkle lights’!”

I go cold.

Sam steps in from the doorway, on duty, calm but sharp. “What’s the plan.”

Noel blinks at him like he’s never seen an adult in the room before. “Plan?”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “We said neutral. No fuel. But neutral doesn’t mean passive.”

Noel inhales. “Yes. Correct. I am being neutral.”

Noel is not being neutral. Noel is vibrating.

Sam turns to me. “You want control.”

I swallow hard. “Yes.”

Sam nods. “Okay. Then you decide what we do today.”

My chest tightens. The urge to run is immediate. Because deciding means committing. Committing means being seen.

But I also feel last night in my palm, like proof I can survive a choice.

I breathe in, slow.

“We don’t talk about it,” I say. “Not with customers. Not with the town. We keep the bakery normal.”

Noel looks personally offended. “But—”

Sam’s voice cuts in, calm. “Okay. That’s step one.”

I continue, because if I stop, I’ll fall apart. “Step two: we document everything. Screenshots. Dates. Whatever.”

Sam nods. “Already started.”

Noel’s eyes widen. “Oh.”

I swallow. “Step three…”

My throat tightens, because step three is the part that feels like swallowing glass.

“If Grant shows up,” I say, voice rough, “I want him out. Quietly.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

Noel opens his mouth, probably to offer violence.

I look at him. “Noel.”

Noel clamps his lips shut.

Progress. Barely.

Sam’s gaze stays on mine. “Anything else.”

I hesitate.

Because there’s a fourth step that scares me more than Grant.

The town.

Their curiosity. Their whispers. Their “just asking.”

The way attention can turn into ownership if you let it.

I exhale slowly. “If someone brings it up… we redirect. We keep it boring.”

Sam nods. “Neutral.”

Noel makes a strangled noise. “But we could also bury it with a better story.”

I stiffen. “Noel.”

Noel raises both hands. “Not about you. Not about Sam. About the festival. About the charities. About the community. I can flood the internet with cinnamon roll content.”

I stare at him.

Noel’s eyes are wide and earnest. “Let him write his weird little article. We drown it in wholesome.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “That’s… actually neutral.”

Noel beams, vindicated. “THANK YOU.”

I stare at Sam. “Is it neutral.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “It’s not a reaction. It’s a replacement.”

My chest tightens.

I hate that it sounds smart.

I exhale. “Fine. Flood the internet with cinnamon roll content. But if you mention me, I will end you.”

Noel nods fast. “No names. No hints. Just buns.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “That sentence shouldn’t exist.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

---

The bakery opens.

Customers come.

And the miracle continues: most people act normal.

A few linger too long. A few eyes flick to Sam, then to me, then away. But no one says anything outright.

Until, of course, someone does.

A middle-aged guy in a puffy coat steps up to the counter, smirking. “So, Wes. The article, huh.”

My stomach drops.

Old Wes rises like a demon.

But Sam’s presence is at my side, steady and quiet. A reminder: neutral doesn’t mean helpless.

I take a slow breath.

“I don’t discuss my private life at work,” I say flatly.

The guy blinks, surprised by the firmness.

Then Sam adds, calm and polite, “What can we get you.”

The guy flushes, mutters, “Uh. Two cinnamon rolls.”

I ring him up. Hand him the bag. End of story.

My hands shake under the counter, but my face stays still.

The guy leaves.

No spectacle.

No spiral.

Sam glances at me, quick check. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

And it’s true.

Because I’m holding the line.

---

## Chapter 17: Grant Holloway Gets Bored

At 11:40 a.m., the bell chimes.

Grant Holloway strolls in like he owns the air.

He’s wearing that expensive coat again, hair perfect, smile sharp.

My stomach drops so hard I feel it in my knees.

Noel is in the corner frosting something aggressively, jaw set.

Sam is by the door immediately, posture calm but unmistakably blocking.

Grant’s gaze flicks to Sam, then to me, then back, like he’s assessing where the leverage is.

“Officer,” Grant says smoothly. “Didn’t expect you here.”

Sam’s voice is flat. “Leave.”

Grant laughs softly. “This again.”

Sam doesn’t move. “This again.”

Grant’s eyes narrow. “I’m here to speak with Wes.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “He didn’t consent.”

Grant’s smile tightens. “Consent. That’s adorable.”

Something cold settles in my chest.

Noel makes a low sound in his throat, like a dog about to bite.

I step forward before Noel commits a felony in my bakery.

My voice comes out steady in a way that surprises me. “Grant.”

Grant’s smile widens. “Wes. There he is.”

I keep my face flat. “You wrote about me.”

Grant spreads his hands. “I wrote about a charming town and its charming characters.”

I feel my teeth want to show. I clamp down on it. Neutral.

“You implied things,” I say. “You invited speculation.”

Grant shrugs. “People speculate. It drives clicks.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Leave.”

Grant ignores him, eyes on me. “I could also write a follow-up. A correction. If you’d like. A nice quote from you, perhaps.”

My stomach turns.

He wants me to dance.

He wants me to validate the story he stole.

I breathe in, slow.

“No,” I say.

Grant blinks. “No?”

“No,” I repeat. “You don’t get my words.”

Grant’s smile falters for half a second.

Sam’s posture doesn’t change, but the air shifts. Like a door closing.

Grant’s eyes flick to Sam, irritated. “You’re very protective.”

Sam’s voice is flat. “Leave.”

Grant’s jaw tightens. “You can’t stop the internet.”

I stare at him. “No. But I can stop you from being in my bakery.”

Grant looks offended, like I’ve broken the script.

Then, because he can’t resist being cruel, he adds lightly, “People love a mystery. Especially when it involves small-town romance.”

My chest tightens, but I don’t flinch.

I just say, calm as ice, “Get out.”

Noel steps up behind me, voice sweet and lethal. “Grant, darling. Go away.”

Grant looks between us, realizes the room has turned against him, and his smile goes brittle.

He lifts his hands. “Fine. Keep your secrets. But don’t be surprised when the town fills in the blanks.”

He pivots toward the door.

Sam doesn’t move until Grant is right in front of him, then says quietly, “If you contact Wes again, it won’t be friendly.”

Grant pauses, eyes narrowing. “Is that a threat, Officer.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “It’s a boundary.”

Grant huffs a laugh and leaves.

The bell chimes.

The door shuts.

And the bakery doesn’t collapse.

Noel exhales shakily. “I hate him.”

I swallow. “Me too.”

Sam turns to me, gaze steady. “Still okay.”

My hands are shaking, but my chest isn’t on fire the way it used to be.

Because this time, I didn’t freeze.

I didn’t disappear.

I held the line.

“Yes,” I say, rough. “I’m okay.”

Sam nods once like he’s proud without making it a performance.

Noel points at me, eyes bright. “You kicked him out.”

I glare. “Don’t.”

Noel clamps his mouth shut and does a tiny silent dance anyway.

Sam’s mouth tips slightly.

I hate that my chest warms.

I hate more that it feels… earned.

Not because I earned being treated well.

Because I earned my own control back.

And for the first time, that feels like something I can build a life on.

Not a headline.

Not a rumor.

A choice.

A line.

A hand I can take when I decide.

So, naturally, I’m terrified.

But I stay.

And that’s new.

**[STOP WRITING]**



## Chapter 15: Handprint

I let go of Sam’s hand and keep walking like I didn’t just do something that would’ve made Old Me spontaneously combust.

The candlelight river keeps moving. People murmur softly. Someone laughs up ahead. The world pretends it’s gentle and harmless, like it hasn’t spent my whole life proving otherwise.

My nervous system doesn’t know what to do with that.

I walk back toward the bakery, boots crunching, shoulders tight, heart still hammering.

Sam keeps pace beside me, still not touching.

Halfway there, he says quietly, “You did that.”

I stare straight ahead. “Did what.”

Sam’s voice stays low. “Chose it.”

My throat tightens, hot and stupid. “It was one second.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “One second is still a choice.”

I hate him for saying it like it’s not terrifying.

I mutter, “Don’t make it inspirational.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Okay.”

I point at him without looking. “Stop.”

“No.”

We reach Candle & Crumb. I unlock the door and let us in, warmth hitting my face like relief.

I lock it behind us.

The quiet of the bakery settles around my shoulders.

Sam takes off his coat. Hangs it neatly. The routine of him here makes my chest ache in a way I don’t want to interrogate.

I clear my throat. “Tea.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I glare. “You’re enjoying that word too much.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Yes.”

I make tea because it gives my hands something to do besides shake.

We end up in the back again, mugs steaming, the world outside muffled.

I stare at my cup for a long time, then finally mutter, “I didn’t mean to.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “You didn’t mean to hold my hand.”

“I meant to,” I correct immediately, because I’m not a liar. “I didn’t mean to… do it where it mattered.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “It mattered because you chose it.”

My throat tightens. I look away, annoyed at the sting behind my eyes.

“I hate that it mattered,” I mutter.

Sam’s voice stays steady. “Why.”

“Because,” I say, rough, “if it matters, then the next part matters. And then the part after that. And suddenly I’m… visible.”

My stomach drops.

I swallow hard. “No.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

My chest tightens. “But we have to.”

Sam’s gaze is calm. “We do. When you’re ready.”

I hate that he gives me time. Time makes me responsible for my own courage.

I take a slow breath.

“Tomorrow,” I say. “We deal with it tomorrow.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

I sip tea and stare at nothing for a minute, then hear myself say, “I didn’t hate tonight.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Good.”

I swallow. “I also didn’t hate… the hand.”

Sam goes still, careful. “Okay.”

I glare reflexively. “Don’t you dare make a face.”

Sam’s mouth tips, faint. “I’m not.”

He is. The liar.

I exhale. “Still okay.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly, warmed. “Yes.”

And in that stupid moment, with tea and warm light and the ovens humming like they’re eavesdropping, I realize something awful:

I’m starting to trust that “yes.”

Which is, frankly, terrible for my brand.

Because there’s a fourth step that scares me more than Grant.

The town.

Their curiosity. Their whispers. Their “just asking.”

The way attention can turn into ownership if you let it.

I exhale slowly. “If someone brings it up… we redirect. We keep it boring.”

Sam nods. “Neutral.”

Noel makes a strangled noise. “But we could also bury it with a better story.”

I stiffen. “Noel.”

Noel raises both hands. “Not about you. Not about Sam. About the festival. About the charities. About the community. I can flood the internet with cinnamon roll content.”

I stare at him.

Noel’s eyes are wide and earnest. “Let him write his weird little article. We drown it in wholesome.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “That’s… actually neutral.”

Noel beams, vindicated. “THANK YOU.”

I stare at Sam. “Is it neutral.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “It’s not a reaction. It’s a replacement.”

My chest tightens.

I hate that it sounds smart.

I exhale. “Fine. Flood the internet with cinnamon roll content. But if you mention me, I will end you.”

Noel nods fast. “No names. No hints. Just buns.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “That sentence shouldn’t exist.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

---

The bakery opens.

Customers come.

And the miracle continues: most people act normal.

A few linger too long. A few eyes flick to Sam, then to me, then away. But no one says anything outright.

Until, of course, someone does.

A middle-aged guy in a puffy coat steps up to the counter, smirking. “So, Wes. The article, huh.”

My stomach drops.

Old Wes rises like a demon.

But Sam’s presence is at my side, steady and quiet. A reminder: neutral doesn’t mean helpless.

I take a slow breath.

“I don’t discuss my private life at work,” I say flatly.

The guy blinks, surprised by the firmness.

Then Sam adds, calm and polite, “What can we get you.”

The guy flushes, mutters, “Uh. Two cinnamon rolls.”

I ring him up. Hand him the bag. End of story.

My hands shake under the counter, but my face stays still.

The guy leaves.

No spectacle.

No spiral.

Sam glances at me, quick check. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

And it’s true.

Because I’m holding the line.

## Chapter 17: Grant Holloway Gets Bored

At 11:40 a.m., the bell chimes.

Grant Holloway strolls in like he owns the air.

He’s wearing that expensive coat again, hair perfect, smile sharp.

My stomach drops so hard I feel it in my knees.

Noel is in the corner frosting something aggressively, jaw set.

Sam is by the door immediately, posture calm but unmistakably blocking.

Grant’s gaze flicks to Sam, then to me, then back, like he’s assessing where the leverage is.

“Officer,” Grant says smoothly. “Didn’t expect you here.”

Sam’s voice is flat. “Leave.”

Grant laughs softly. “This again.”

Sam doesn’t move. “This again.”

Grant’s eyes narrow. “I’m here to speak with Wes.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “He didn’t consent.”

Grant’s smile tightens. “Consent. That’s adorable.”

Something cold settles in my chest.

Noel makes a low sound in his throat, like a dog about to bite.

I step forward before Noel commits a felony in my bakery.

My voice comes out steady in a way that surprises me. “Grant.”

Grant’s smile widens. “Wes. There he is.”

I keep my face flat. “You wrote about me.”

Grant spreads his hands. “I wrote about a charming town and its charming characters.”

I feel my teeth want to show. I clamp down on it. Neutral.

“You implied things,” I say. “You invited speculation.”

Grant shrugs. “People speculate. It drives clicks.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Leave.”

Grant ignores him, eyes on me. “I could also write a follow-up. A correction. If you’d like. A nice quote from you, perhaps.”

My stomach turns.

He wants me to dance.

He wants me to validate the story he stole.

I breathe in, slow.

“No,” I say.

Grant blinks. “No?”

“No,” I repeat. “You don’t get my words.”

Grant’s smile falters for half a second.

Sam’s posture doesn’t change, but the air shifts. Like a door closing.

Grant’s eyes flick to Sam, irritated. “You’re very protective.”

Sam’s voice is flat. “Leave.”

Grant’s jaw tightens. “You can’t stop the internet.”

I stare at him. “No. But I can stop you from being in my bakery.”

Grant looks offended, like I’ve broken the script.

Then, because he can’t resist being cruel, he adds lightly, “People love a mystery. Especially when it involves small-town romance.”

My chest tightens, but I don’t flinch.

I just say, calm as ice, “Get out.”

Noel steps up behind me, voice sweet and lethal. “Grant, darling. Go away.”

Grant looks between us, realizes the room has turned against him, and his smile goes brittle.

He lifts his hands. “Fine. Keep your secrets. But don’t be surprised when the town fills in the blanks.”

He pivots toward the door.

Sam doesn’t move until Grant is right in front of him, then says quietly, “If you contact Wes again, it won’t be friendly.”

Grant pauses, eyes narrowing. “Is that a threat, Officer.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “It’s a boundary.”

Grant huffs a laugh and leaves.

The bell chimes.

The door shuts.

And the bakery doesn’t collapse.

Noel exhales shakily. “I hate him.”

I swallow. “Me too.”

Sam turns to me, gaze steady. “Still okay.”

My hands are shaking, but my chest isn’t on fire the way it used to be.

Because this time, I didn’t freeze.

I didn’t disappear.

I held the line.

“Yes,” I say, rough. “I’m okay.”

Sam nods once like he’s proud without making it a performance.

Noel points at me, eyes bright. “You kicked him out.”

I glare. “Don’t.”

Noel clamps his mouth shut and does a tiny silent dance anyway.

Sam’s mouth tips slightly.

I hate that my chest warms.

I hate more that it feels… earned.

Not because I earned being treated well.

Because I earned my own control back.

And for the first time, that feels like something I can build a life on.

Not a headline.

Not a rumor.

A choice.

A line.

A hand I can take when I decide.

So, naturally, I’m terrified.

But I stay.

And that’s new.

**[STOP WRITING]**




## Chapter 15: Handprint

I let go of Sam’s hand and keep walking like I didn’t just do something that would’ve made Old Me spontaneously combust.

The candlelight river keeps moving. People murmur softly. Someone laughs up ahead. The world pretends it’s gentle and harmless, like it hasn’t spent my whole life proving otherwise.

My palm still remembers his.

Sam stays close, not touching, not pressing, just… there. Like he understands the rule: if you make it a thing, it becomes a thing. And then the town owns it.

We finish the walk. People blow out candles. Noel cries a little because Noel treats shared oxygen like a spiritual experience.

Eben stands in the snow looking like he wants to arrest sentimentality.

The crowd disperses.

And somehow, no one stops me.

No one corners me with a question. No one asks if the baker and the officer are “together” like it’s their business. No one reaches for their phone like I’m content.

My nervous system doesn’t know what to do with that.

I walk back toward the bakery, boots crunching, shoulders tight, heart still hammering.

Sam keeps pace beside me, still not touching.

Halfway there, he says quietly, “You did that.”

I stare straight ahead. “Did what.”

Sam’s voice stays low. “Chose it.”

My throat tightens, hot and stupid. “It was one second.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “One second is still a choice.”

I hate him for saying it like it’s not terrifying.

I mutter, “Don’t make it inspirational.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Okay.”

I point at him without looking. “Stop.”

“No.”

We reach Candle & Crumb. I unlock the door and let us in, warmth hitting my face like relief.

I lock it behind us.

The quiet of the bakery settles around my shoulders.

Sam takes off his coat. Hangs it neatly. The routine of him here makes my chest ache in a way I don’t want to interrogate.

I clear my throat. “Tea.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I glare. “You’re enjoying that word too much.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Yes.”

I make tea because it gives my hands something to do besides shake.

We end up in the back again, mugs steaming, the world outside muffled.

I stare at my cup for a long time, then finally mutter, “I didn’t mean to.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “You didn’t mean to hold my hand.”

“I meant to,” I correct immediately, because I’m not a liar. “I didn’t mean to… do it where it mattered.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “It mattered because you chose it.”

My throat tightens. I look away, annoyed at the sting behind my eyes.

“I hate that it mattered,” I mutter.

Sam’s voice stays steady. “Why.”

“Because,” I say, rough, “if it matters, then the next part matters. And then the part after that. And suddenly I’m… visible.”

Sam nods once, like he’s heard this a thousand times already from the way my body flinches. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

Silence stretches.

Then Sam says quietly, “Do you want to talk about the article.”

My stomach drops.

I swallow hard. “No.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

My chest tightens. “But we have to.”

Sam’s gaze is calm. “We do. When you’re ready.”

I hate that he gives me time. Time makes me responsible for my own courage.

I take a slow breath.

“Tomorrow,” I say. “We deal with it tomorrow.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

I sip tea and stare at nothing for a minute, then hear myself say, “I didn’t hate tonight.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Good.”

I swallow. “I also didn’t hate… the hand.”

Sam goes still, careful. “Okay.”

I glare reflexively. “Don’t you dare make a face.”

Sam’s mouth tips, faint. “I’m not.”

He is. The liar.

I exhale. “Still okay.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly, warmed. “Yes.”

And in that stupid moment, with tea and warm light and the ovens humming like they’re eavesdropping, I realize something awful:

I’m starting to trust that “yes.”

Which is, frankly, terrible for my brand.

---

## Chapter 16: The Plan

Morning comes with snow and consequences.

Noel arrives at 6:30 a.m. like a man who has not slept and has instead been possessed by civic rage.

He slams his phone on the counter. “We are not letting this stand.”

I don’t look at it. “Noel.”

Noel points at the screen anyway. “He updated it! He added a line about ‘holiday romance blooming under twinkle lights’!”

I go cold.

Sam steps in from the doorway, on duty, calm but sharp. “What’s the plan.”

Noel blinks at him like he’s never seen an adult in the room before. “Plan?”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “We said neutral. No fuel. But neutral doesn’t mean passive.”

Noel inhales. “Yes. Correct. I am being neutral.”

Noel is not being neutral. Noel is vibrating.

Sam turns to me. “You want control.”

I swallow hard. “Yes.”

Sam nods. “Okay. Then you decide what we do today.”

My chest tightens. The urge to run is immediate. Because deciding means committing. Committing means being seen.

But I also feel last night in my palm, like proof I can survive a choice.

I breathe in, slow.

“We don’t talk about it,” I say. “Not with customers. Not with the town. We keep the bakery normal.”

Noel looks personally offended. “But—”

Sam’s voice cuts in, calm. “Okay. That’s step one.”

I continue, because if I stop, I’ll fall apart. “Step two: we document everything. Screenshots. Dates. Whatever.”

Sam nods. “Already started.”

Noel’s eyes widen. “Oh.”

I swallow. “Step three…”

My throat tightens, because step three is the part that feels like swallowing glass.

“If Grant shows up,” I say, voice rough, “I want him out. Quietly.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

Noel opens his mouth, probably to offer violence.

I look at him. “Noel.”

Noel clamps his lips shut.

Progress. Barely.

Sam’s gaze stays on mine. “Anything else.”

I hesitate.

Because there’s a fourth step that scares me more than Grant.

The town.

Their curiosity. Their whispers. Their “just asking.”

The way attention can turn into ownership if you let it.

I exhale slowly. “If someone brings it up… we redirect. We keep it boring.”

Sam nods. “Neutral.”

Noel makes a strangled noise. “But we could also bury it with a better story.”

I stiffen. “Noel.”

Noel raises both hands. “Not about you. Not about Sam. About the festival. About the charities. About the community. I can flood the internet with cinnamon roll content.”

I stare at him.

Noel’s eyes are wide and earnest. “Let him write his weird little article. We drown it in wholesome.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “That’s… actually neutral.”

Noel beams, vindicated. “THANK YOU.”

I stare at Sam. “Is it neutral.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “It’s not a reaction. It’s a replacement.”

My chest tightens.

I hate that it sounds smart.

I exhale. “Fine. Flood the internet with cinnamon roll content. But if you mention me, I will end you.”

Noel nods fast. “No names. No hints. Just buns.”

I pinch the bridge of my nose. “That sentence shouldn’t exist.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

---

The bakery opens.

Customers come.

And the miracle continues: most people act normal.

A few linger too long. A few eyes flick to Sam, then to me, then away. But no one says anything outright.

Until, of course, someone does.

A middle-aged guy in a puffy coat steps up to the counter, smirking. “So, Wes. The article, huh.”

My stomach drops.

Old Wes rises like a demon.

But Sam’s presence is at my side, steady and quiet. A reminder: neutral doesn’t mean helpless.

I take a slow breath.

“I don’t discuss my private life at work,” I say flatly.

The guy blinks, surprised by the firmness.

Then Sam adds, calm and polite, “What can we get you.”

The guy flushes, mutters, “Uh. Two cinnamon rolls.”

I ring him up. Hand him the bag. End of story.

My hands shake under the counter, but my face stays still.

The guy leaves.

No spectacle.

No spiral.

Sam glances at me, quick check. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

And it’s true.

Because I’m holding the line.

## Chapter 17: Grant Holloway Gets Bored

At 11:40 a.m., the bell chimes.

Grant Holloway strolls in like he owns the air.

He’s wearing that expensive coat again, hair perfect, smile sharp.

My stomach drops so hard I feel it in my knees.

Noel is in the corner frosting something aggressively, jaw set.

Sam is by the door immediately, posture calm but unmistakably blocking.

Grant’s gaze flicks to Sam, then to me, then back, like he’s assessing where the leverage is.

“Officer,” Grant says smoothly. “Didn’t expect you here.”

Sam’s voice is flat. “Leave.”

Grant laughs softly. “This again.”

Sam doesn’t move. “This again.”

Grant’s eyes narrow. “I’m here to speak with Wes.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “He didn’t consent.”

Grant’s smile tightens. “Consent. That’s adorable.”

Something cold settles in my chest.

Noel makes a low sound in his throat, like a dog about to bite.

I step forward before Noel commits a felony in my bakery.

My voice comes out steady in a way that surprises me. “Grant.”

Grant’s smile widens. “Wes. There he is.”

I keep my face flat. “You wrote about me.”

Grant spreads his hands. “I wrote about a charming town and its charming characters.”

I feel my teeth want to show. I clamp down on it. Neutral.

“You implied things,” I say. “You invited speculation.”

Grant shrugs. “People speculate. It drives clicks.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Leave.”

Grant ignores him, eyes on me. “I could also write a follow-up. A correction. If you’d like. A nice quote from you, perhaps.”

My stomach turns.

He wants me to dance.

He wants me to validate the story he stole.

I breathe in, slow.

“No,” I say.

Grant blinks. “No?”

“No,” I repeat. “You don’t get my words.”

Grant’s smile falters for half a second.

Sam’s posture doesn’t change, but the air shifts. Like a door closing.

Grant’s eyes flick to Sam, irritated. “You’re very protective.”

Sam’s voice is flat. “Leave.”

Grant’s jaw tightens. “You can’t stop the internet.”

I stare at him. “No. But I can stop you from being in my bakery.”

Grant looks offended, like I’ve broken the script.

Then, because he can’t resist being cruel, he adds lightly, “People love a mystery. Especially when it involves small-town romance.”

My chest tightens, but I don’t flinch.

I just say, calm as ice, “Get out.”

Noel steps up behind me, voice sweet and lethal. “Grant, darling. Go away.”

Grant looks between us, realizes the room has turned against him, and his smile goes brittle.

He lifts his hands. “Fine. Keep your secrets. But don’t be surprised when the town fills in the blanks.”

He pivots toward the door.

Sam doesn’t move until Grant is right in front of him, then says quietly, “If you contact Wes again, it won’t be friendly.”

Grant pauses, eyes narrowing. “Is that a threat, Officer.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “It’s a boundary.”

Grant huffs a laugh and leaves.

The bell chimes.

The door shuts.

And the bakery doesn’t collapse.

Noel exhales shakily. “I hate him.”

I swallow. “Me too.”

Sam turns to me, gaze steady. “Still okay.”

My hands are shaking, but my chest isn’t on fire the way it used to be.

Because this time, I didn’t freeze.

I didn’t disappear.

I held the line.

“Yes,” I say, rough. “I’m okay.”

Sam nods once like he’s proud without making it a performance.

Noel points at me, eyes bright. “You kicked him out.”

I glare. “Don’t.”

Noel clamps his mouth shut and does a tiny silent dance anyway.

Sam’s mouth tips slightly.

I hate that my chest warms.

I hate more that it feels… earned.

Not because I earned being treated well.

Because I earned my own control back.

And for the first time, that feels like something I can build a life on.

Not a headline.

Not a rumor.

A choice.

A line.

A hand I can take when I decide.

So, naturally, I’m terrified.

But I stay.

And that’s new.

**[STOP WRITING]**




## Chapter 18: Aftershock

For a full minute after Grant leaves, the bakery is too quiet.

Not peaceful quiet. The kind of quiet where your body is waiting for the second hit.

Noel is still behind me, breathing like he just ran a marathon fueled by rage and peppermint.

Sam stands by the door, shoulders squared, calm like the world didn’t just try to take something from me again.

My hands are shaking, but my voice is steady, which feels like witchcraft.

I clear my throat. “Okay. Back to work.”

Noel stares at me like I just levitated. “Wes.”

I shoot him a warning look. “Noel.”

Noel clamps his mouth shut so hard I can see the restraint vibrating in his cheeks.

Sam’s gaze flicks to me. Quick check. No pressure. Just presence.

“Still okay,” he murmurs.

I swallow. “Yes.”

And I mean it.

Because Grant walked in expecting to own the narrative, and I told him no. Out loud. In my own bakery.

That should feel like a tiny victory. It feels like a tectonic plate shifting.

The bell chimes again.

A customer walks in, stamps snow off their boots, and says, “Morning! Smells amazing.”

Normal.

I cling to normal like it’s a railing on an ice rink.

I greet customers. I ring up cinnamon rolls. I keep my face neutral and my voice flat and my boundaries sharp.

Noel stays in the corner, aggressively posting photos of baked goods. I can see him typing with fury.

**NOEL’S PHONE (visible from across the room):**
“Just buns. Just buns. JUST BUNS.”

Sam stays nearby, “on patrol,” which is code for “I’m not leaving you alone with your nervous system today.”

I hate that it helps.

By noon, the town has done what towns do: decided Grant Holloway is trash.

Not loudly. Not with a mob. With the kind of passive, relentless social correction only a small town can deliver.

Mrs. Alden comes in and places her order like always, then pauses and says, very calmly, “That man was rude.”

I blink. “Yes.”

Mrs. Alden nods once, satisfied. “Good.”

Then she adds, voice dropping like she’s sharing state secrets, “If he returns, I will bite him.”

I stare. “Mrs. Alden.”

She smiles sweetly. “I’m old. What are they going to do.”

She leaves with her pastries and her implied violence.

Noel watches her go, eyes shining. “The elders have spoken.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Okay.”

I glare at him on reflex. “Stop.”

“No.”

The day keeps moving. The line comes and goes. The gossip tries to poke its head up and we keep it boring until it dies.

Neutral. Redirect. Cinnamon rolls.

And somehow, by closing time, the headline feels… smaller.

Still there. Still annoying. Still a violation.

But not a trap.

I lock the door, flip the sign, and exhale like I’ve been holding my breath since dawn.

Noel slides off his stool and says, reverent, “You were terrifying today.”

I mutter, “Good.”

Noel points at me. “Like… hot terrifying.”

I go still.

Sam’s voice cuts in, calm and deadly. “Noel.”

Noel claps a hand over his mouth. “Sorry. Boundaries. I’m learning. I’m leaving.”

He grabs his coat and bolts before I can throw a whisk at him.

Now it’s just me and Sam in the warm bakery light again.

The quiet returns.

But this time it doesn’t feel like a second hit.

It feels like space.

Sam takes off his gloves. “You held the line.”

I stare at the counter, throat tight. “I didn’t fall apart.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “No.”

I swallow. “That’s new.”

Sam nods. “Yeah.”

My chest aches. “I don’t know what to do with it.”

Sam’s voice stays low. “Keep it.”

I laugh once, sharp and disbelieving. “Keep it.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

And the ridiculous thing is: my face wants to soften at that.

Which means I need to change the subject before I become a Hallmark movie.

“Soup,” I mutter.

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I point at him. “You are insufferable.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I groan and head upstairs.

---

## Chapter 19: The Quiet Choice

My apartment smells like onions within ten minutes because soup is what I do when I don’t know what else to do.

Sam sits at the table while I chop, calm and present, like he belongs in the background of my life now.

Which is a problem.

I throw carrots into the pot with more force than necessary.

Sam watches me for a beat. “You’re angry.”

“I’m always angry,” I mutter.

Sam’s voice stays neutral. “Different angry.”

I exhale hard and admit it because lying would make this worse. “I hate that he tried to turn me into a story.”

Sam nods once. “I know.”

“I hate that people want to consume it,” I add, voice rough. “Like… like my life is entertainment.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “It’s not.”

I swallow. “But it feels like it is.”

Sam doesn’t rush in. Doesn’t talk over me. He just waits, like he always does, for the point under the point.

I keep chopping because my hands need violence.

Then I say it, low. “I hate that it makes me want to hide.”

Sam’s voice is steady. “Wanting to hide doesn’t mean you’re weak.”

My throat tightens.

I stare at the knife, then set it down carefully because my hands are shaking again.

Sam doesn’t move closer yet. He asks, “Still okay.”

I swallow. “No.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I glare with no bite. “Stop.”

“No.”

The soup simmers.

Silence stretches.

Then Sam says softly, “We can make a new plan.”

My chest tightens. “What kind.”

Sam’s gaze stays calm. “For the town. For Christmas. For… us.”

The last word lands like a heavy ornament.

I swallow hard. “That’s too big.”

Sam nods once. “Okay. Then small.”

I exhale, shaky. “Small.”

Sam leans forward a fraction. “You tell me what you want the town to see.”

I stare at him.

Because the answer isn’t “nothing,” not anymore.

I’ve learned that “nothing” is a cage. It’s safe, sure. It’s also lonely.

And I’m tired of lonely.

I swallow, throat tight. “I want… normal.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “Normal.”

“Not rumors,” I say. “Not headlines. Not Noel’s mouth. Just… normal.”

Sam nods. “Okay. What does normal look like.”

My chest aches. “You being around. People seeing you in the bakery. You walking me home sometimes. You existing in my space without it becoming… a spectacle.”

Sam’s gaze warms, careful. “And if they speculate.”

I swallow. “We don’t feed it.”

Sam nods. “Neutral.”

I exhale. “Neutral.”

Sam’s voice goes softer. “And what do you want me to do when someone pushes.”

I stare at him. “The same thing you did today.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

The soup is done. I ladle it into bowls and sit across from him, hands wrapped around warm ceramic like I’m trying to borrow steadiness.

We eat quietly.

Then, because I’m apparently incapable of letting peace exist without testing it, I say, low, “Christmas Eve is in two days.”

Sam’s gaze flicks up. “Yeah.”

The fear spikes in my chest, immediate. “Noel will plan something.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Yes.”

“And the town will be… out,” I say, voice tight. “Candles. Tree. Photos. All of it.”

Sam nods, steady. “Yes.”

I swallow hard. “I don’t want to spend it bracing.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Then we choose one thing. One small thing. On your terms.”

My throat tightens.

I hate how much I want that.

I whisper, “Like what.”

Sam pauses, then says carefully, “You decide. But… maybe we walk to the tree together. No hiding. No performance. Just walking.”

My chest tightens painfully.

That’s visible. That’s the town.

That’s the exact thing my body has always treated like danger.

But I think of the rink. Two fingers. Not dying.

I think of the candle walk. One full hand for one beat. Still not dying.

I think of today. Grant leaving. Me holding the line. Still not dying.

I exhale, shaky. “Walking.”

Sam nods. “Just walking.”

I swallow hard, then nod once. “Okay.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “That okay counts.”

I roll my eyes because it’s safer than crying. “Stop.”

“No.”

## Chapter 20: Christmas Eve

Christmas Eve hits Tinsel Town like a glitter bomb.

The square is packed. The big tree is lit. The air smells like cocoa and pine and money people spend on nostalgia.

Noel is everywhere at once, wearing a scarf that could double as a flag, rallying volunteers and directing traffic like he’s running a small nation.

Eben stands near the tree, arms crossed, radiating a silent threat to anyone attempting joy incorrectly.

Hugh is in a coat that looks like it was made from velvet curtains and self-regard.

And me?

I’m at the bakery until seven, doing what I do best: feeding people so they’ll stop talking for two seconds.

Sam is “on patrol” again, drifting in and out, steadying the edges of the night without making it obvious.

At 7:15, I lock the door, flip the sign, and just… stand there for a moment with my hand on the key.

The square is loud outside. Full of light. Full of eyes.

My stomach tightens.

Sam appears at the bottom of the stairs, calm as ever. He doesn’t rush me. He just looks up and waits.

Choice.

I swallow hard and walk down.

When I reach him, he says quietly, “Still okay.”

My chest is tight, but my feet are moving, which is new.

“Yes,” I say.

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

We start walking toward Evergreen Square.

Not touching.

Not yet.

Just side by side, matching pace, like it’s normal. Like I’m not about to bolt.

People pass us. A few nod at Sam. A few glance at me.

No one stops us.

Noel sees us from across the street, eyes going wide like he’s about to scream.

Eben barks, “NOEL.”

Noel clamps his mouth shut so fast I’m surprised he doesn’t sprain something.

We reach the edge of the square.

The tree lights glitter.

Phones are out, but they’re aimed at the tree, at the performers, at the snow machine spraying fake flakes like the sky wasn’t already doing that.

Sam leans slightly closer, voice low. “Do you want the tether.”

My heart pounds.

I stare at his hand, gloved, offered without demand.

My whole body wants to run.

My whole body also remembers how it felt not to fall.

I inhale.

“Two fingers,” I whisper.

Sam’s mouth tips, barely. “Okay.”

I slide two fingers into his palm.

He closes his hand gently around them, careful, like this is fragile and sacred and entirely mine to revoke.

We walk into the square like that.

Two fingers.

Not a declaration. Not a headline.

Just a choice.

A couple people glance over. A couple smile. No one says anything.

The world doesn’t end.

My chest unlocks a fraction.

Sam murmurs, “Still okay.”

I swallow hard, eyes stinging for no good reason I’m willing to admit.

“Yes,” I whisper. “I’m okay.”

Sam’s grip stays light. Respectful. Steady.

We stop near the tree, listening to someone singing carols on a little stage. Noel is wiping his eyes dramatically. Eben looks like he’s considering violence against the concept of harmony.

I stand there with two fingers in Sam’s hand, and the town is bright and loud and full of eyes, and somehow it doesn’t feel like a cage.

It feels like air.

And for the first time, I understand something I didn’t want to understand:

Being seen doesn’t have to mean being taken.

Not if you choose what you give.

Not if you keep your hand on the line.

Sam leans in slightly, voice low. “Merry Christmas, Wes.”

My throat tightens.

I hate that my voice breaks when I answer.

“Merry Christmas,” I manage.

Sam’s hand squeezes once, gentle, not claiming.

Then he lets go like he’s honoring the moment for what it is: mine.

We stand under the lights.

And I don’t run.

I just… stay.

**[STOP WRITING]**



## Chapter 21: The Tree Doesn’t Bite

We stand under the lights for a long minute, listening to carolers who are trying their best and succeeding about half the time.

My breath fogs. The air smells like pine and cocoa and other people’s optimism.

Sam doesn’t touch me again. He doesn’t even angle his body like he’s trying to claim space. He just stays near, steady, like a wall I can lean on without anyone noticing.

Which is the point.

Which is why my chest still feels too tight.

Noel spots us again and does a full-body tremor of excitement. His eyes are wet. He’s going to make this weird.

Eben appears beside him like a shadow made of disapproval.

“Noel,” Eben says flatly.

Noel clamps his mouth shut and nods so hard his scarf flutters. He does not approach. He does not speak.

I’m genuinely impressed.

Sam leans in slightly, voice low. “You want to leave now or stay.”

Choice.

My stomach flips.

I look at the tree. The lights. The crowd. The fact that I’m here and I’m not dying.

I exhale slowly. “Stay. Five minutes.”

Sam nods. “Okay. Five.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he says, and it’s warm enough to make my throat tighten again.

We stay.

And the miracle is: nothing happens.

No one corners me. No one asks questions. No one drags my life into their mouth like it’s candy.

A few people smile when they see Sam near me. A few glance at me like I’m part of the town instead of a rumor in an article.

It’s… fine.

It’s more than fine.

It’s survivable.

Then a little girl with a pink hat and a candle cup trips near us and almost spills wax on her mitten.

I react before I can think, steadying the cup with a light touch.

She looks up at me, bright-eyed. “Thanks!”

Her dad nods at me. “Appreciate it.”

No subtext. No commentary. Just… normal.

My chest loosens another fraction.

Sam’s voice is low. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yeah.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Okay.”

I glare weakly. “Stop.”

“No.”

Five minutes become ten without me noticing.

That’s the scariest part.

---

## Chapter 22: Noel Tries Not to Be Noel

Eventually, Noel can’t take it anymore.

He approaches like someone trying not to spook a wild animal.

“I’m being normal,” Noel whispers.

Eben appears behind him like a warning label.

Noel holds up his hands. “I’m not saying anything. I’m just… here. Casually.”

I stare at him. “Noel.”

Noel nods fast. “Yes. Boundaries. I have them. I’m learning them. I’m respecting them.”

Eben’s gaze flicks to me, then back to Noel. “Speak less.”

Noel presses a hand to his heart. “This is oppression.”

I exhale through my nose, but it almost turns into a laugh, and that’s unacceptable.

Noel’s eyes flick between me and Sam, soft for once. “I’m glad you came.”

My chest tightens, suspicious. “Don’t.”

Noel nods. “Okay. I won’t make it a thing.”

He pauses, then adds very carefully, “If anyone gives you trouble because of that stupid article… they answer to me.”

I blink.

Noel, the chaos gremlin, looks genuinely angry on my behalf.

My throat tightens.

I force out, rough, “Thanks.”

Noel’s eyes go shiny again, immediately. “Okay, I’m leaving before I cry.”

He turns and flees into the crowd.

Eben watches him go, then looks at me.

Eben’s face is still blank, but his voice is quieter. “You did good.”

I freeze.

Eben does not do praise. Eben does not do warmth. Eben barely does oxygen.

I swallow hard. “It was ten minutes.”

Eben nods once. “Still good.”

Then he walks away like he didn’t just drop a brick of validation on my nervous system.

Sam glances at me, the faintest curve in his mouth. “Eben approved.”

I stare at him. “Don’t you dare.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I point at him. “Stop.”

“No.”

---

## Chapter 23: Upstairs

We leave the square when my body finally starts to shake from cold and adrenaline.

No drama. No big exit.

Just two people walking away from the lights.

Halfway down the street, Sam says quietly, “You chose it.”

I grit my teeth. “You’re going to say that every time.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “Yes.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

We get back to Candle & Crumb. I unlock the door. We step into warmth.

And the second the lock clicks behind us, the last of the public tension snaps.

Not in a panic way.

In a release.

My shoulders drop. My breath comes easier. My skin feels like it’s been buzzing for hours and is finally allowed to land.

Sam stays still, watching me like he’s waiting for me to set the pace.

Choice again.

I hate how much I’m starting to need that.

I swallow hard and say it, low. “Upstairs.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

We go up.

My apartment is dim, warm, quiet. A little string of lights Noel insisted I hang in the window twinkles like it’s trying to be smug.

I take off my coat and toss it over a chair. Sam does the same, neat and controlled.

I turn to face him and realize my hands are trembling.

Sam notices immediately. He doesn’t move closer. He just asks, soft, “Still okay.”

I exhale, shaky. “Yes. I’m just… full.”

Sam nods, understanding without making it poetry. “Yeah.”

I stare at him for a beat, then whisper, “I held your hand.”

Sam’s eyes soften. “You did.”

I swallow hard. “In public.”

Sam’s voice is low. “Yeah.”

My throat tightens. “And you didn’t… squeeze. You didn’t… make it into anything.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “It was yours.”

My chest aches in a way that hurts.

I step closer, slow. He doesn’t move. He waits.

I stop just inside his space and whisper, “I want you to kiss me.”

Sam’s eyes flicker, careful. “Okay. Where.”

I blink. “Where?”

Sam’s voice is steady. “Do you want it gentle. Do you want it hungry. Do you want it quick.”

My throat tightens, heat pooling low in my belly. The fact that he asks makes my whole body unclench.

I swallow. “Hungry. But… slow.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

He kisses me like a promise he’s still checking in on. Warm, firm, unhurried. His hands hover at my waist, waiting.

I nod slightly.

He touches me, light at first, then steadier when I lean into it.

My whole body feels like it’s been braced for years and is finally allowed to soften.

I pull back just enough to breathe and mutter, “This is… stupid.”

Sam’s brows lift. “What is.”

“Feeling good,” I snap quietly. “It’s suspicious.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

He kisses me again, and the sarcasm drains out of me like it never stood a chance.

We make it to the couch. Then the floor. Then the bed, because gravity is rude.

It’s not frantic. It’s not performative.

It’s just… chosen.

Every time he checks, I answer.

Every time I tense, he slows.

When I finally break, it’s into his shoulder, quiet and shaking, like my body doesn’t know how to accept warmth without apology.

Sam’s hand rubs slow circles along my back, grounding. “Still okay,” he murmurs.

I swallow hard, voice wrecked. “Yes.”

And for once, the yes doesn’t feel like bravery.

It feels like truth.

---

## Chapter 24: Christmas Morning

I wake up to sunlight and silence.

For one horrifying second, my brain doesn’t know why there’s a body beside me.

Then I remember.

Sam is asleep on his back, hair mussed, expression peaceful in a way that looks wrong on him because he’s usually so controlled.

My chest tightens.

I stare at him like he might vanish if I blink.

He doesn’t.

He shifts slightly, eyes opening, locking on mine immediately like he’s been trained to wake up alert.

Then his gaze softens when he recognizes me.

“Merry Christmas,” he says, voice rough with sleep.

My throat tightens so hard it hurts.

I stare at him, then mutter, “Don’t.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I exhale. “Stop.”

“No.”

I roll onto my back and stare at the ceiling like it’s safer than looking at the man I just let into my bed and my life.

Silence stretches.

Then Sam says quietly, “Do you regret it.”

I swallow.

My instincts want to say yes, because yes is armor. Yes is control. Yes means I don’t have to risk wanting again.

But my body is warm. My apartment is quiet. My palm still remembers his.

I breathe in.

“No,” I whisper. “I don’t.”

Sam’s voice is low. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

I stare at the ceiling, then finally turn my head and look at him again.

He’s watching me like I’m something fragile he refuses to treat as fragile.

I whisper, “I don’t know how to do this.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “We do it your way.”

My chest tightens. “My way is… terrible.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

I exhale, then say the thing that scares me most because it’s simple and it’s honest.

“Stay,” I whisper.

Sam doesn’t hesitate. Doesn’t make it a win. Doesn’t make it a vow he’ll weaponize later.

He just nods once. “Okay.”

And the okay lands like an anchor.

---

Downstairs, the bakery is still asleep. The ovens are cold. The world is quiet for once.

We make coffee together in my tiny kitchen like it’s normal.

Sam stands close, not touching, then brushes his fingers against mine when he reaches for a mug.

Not asking now. Just… domestic accident.

My chest tightens anyway.

I glance up at him.

He pauses, catches himself, and asks softly, “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I roll my eyes and sip coffee to hide the fact that I’m smiling.

Outside, the town is still glowing under snow.

Inside, I’m not bracing.

Not fully.

Not today.

And that’s enough.

For now.

**[STOP WRITING]**



## Chapter 25: Open Sign

Christmas morning is supposed to be sacred and quiet and full of family traditions.

In Tinsel Town, it’s also apparently a contact sport.

My phone buzzes at 8:07 a.m.

**NOEL:** ARE YOU ALIVE
**NOEL:** I AM BRINGING MUFFINS
**NOEL:** DO NOT PRETEND YOU’RE NOT HOME
**NOEL:** I CAN SEE YOUR WINDOW LIGHTS FROM THE SQUARE

I stare at the screen like it’s a threat.

Sam sips coffee across from me, watching my face. “Noel.”

“Yes,” I mutter.

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

“Stop.”

“No.”

The buzzer downstairs goes off five minutes later.

Noel doesn’t use doors. Noel announces himself.

I exhale and stand. “Do not let him upstairs.”

Sam’s brows lift. “He’s your friend.”

“He’s a hazard,” I snap.

Sam’s eyes warm. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

I go downstairs and unlock the bakery door.

Noel barrels in with a giant box and cheeks pink from cold, wearing a Santa hat like it’s welded to his personality.

“MERRY CHRISTMAS,” Noel stage-whispers, because he’s incapable of a normal volume.

“Quiet,” I hiss.

Noel freezes, then whispers even louder, “SORRY.”

He holds up the box. “Muffins.”

I stare. “Why.”

Noel looks offended. “Because it’s Christmas. And because I assumed you’d be open anyway because you’re allergic to rest.”

I open my mouth to argue.

Then I realize he’s right and it makes me furious.

Noel’s eyes flick past me, up the stairs. “Is he here.”

“Noel.”

Noel presses a hand to his chest. “Boundaries. I’m not asking about your private life. I’m asking about… his physical location.”

I narrow my eyes. “He’s upstairs.”

Noel’s whole face lights up like a child who’s been told Santa is real.

I point at him. “You will not go upstairs.”

Noel nods rapidly. “I will not go upstairs. I am a normal person. I respect privacy.”

Eben’s voice behind him says, “Liar.”

Noel whips around. “EBEN.”

Eben steps in from the cold, scarf tight, expression grim as ever, holding a small paper bag like it contains contraband.

I blink. “Why are you here.”

Eben shrugs once. “Noel said muffins.”

Noel lifts the box proudly. “Muffins.”

Eben holds up the bag. “I brought coffee.”

I stare at him like he’s committed an act of kindness in public and might be arrested.

Eben’s eyes narrow. “Do not react.”

I swallow. “Okay.”

Eben nods once like that’s acceptable.

Noel leans in, whispering, “We are having a *friend Christmas*. In your bakery. This is not negotiable.”

“I didn’t agree,” I mutter.

Noel smiles brightly. “Yes you did.”

I hate him.

I also… don’t.

Because the bakery is warm. The lights are soft. The world outside is loud. And somehow, these idiots have decided this is where they want to be.

I exhale through my nose. “Fine. But quiet.”

Noel grins. “Quiet.”

He immediately fails at being quiet.

---

## Chapter 26: Friend Christmas

Sam comes downstairs a few minutes later, hair still slightly damp from a quick shower, hoodie under his coat, looking like he slept in my bed and is trying not to make it a thing.

Noel sees him and makes a sound like a kettle.

Eben’s head snaps toward Noel.

“Noel,” Eben warns.

Noel clamps his mouth shut so hard it’s impressive, then whispers, “Hi.”

Sam nods politely. “Hi.”

Noel trembles with restraint.

Eben sets the coffee on the counter and looks at Sam, then at me, then away like eye contact might cause feelings.

“I’m here for food,” Eben says flatly. “Not… whatever this is.”

Noel whispers, “Love.”

Eben’s stare could curdle milk. “Stop.”

Noel stops.

We end up at the little table in the back with muffins and coffee and the kind of quiet that feels earned.

Noel tells a story about accidentally volunteering himself to dress up as Santa for the kids’ breakfast at the inn.

“I did not realize the suit would be… sweaty,” Noel says, solemn.

Eben says, “It’s a suit.”

Noel nods gravely. “It’s a swamp.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly.

I catch it, and my chest tightens because it’s stupidly domestic to be sitting here with Sam while Noel talks nonsense and Eben looks like he’s suffering through community.

Noel pulls out his phone and shoves it toward me. “Okay. Important. The cinnamon roll content strategy is working.”

I narrow my eyes. “What did you post.”

Noel beams. “Only buns. No names. No hints. Just buns.”

He scrolls. It’s photos of pastries. Festive behind-the-scenes shots. The bakery oven. The town tree in the background.

A caption reads: **“CANDLE & CRUMB: BAKING THROUGH THE SEASON.”**

Noel looks up, proud. “See? Harmless.”

I squint. “That’s dangerously competent.”

Noel gasps. “I can be competent.”

Eben mutters, “Rare.”

Noel ignores him and scrolls again. “Also, people are roasting Grant.”

I tense.

Noel quickly adds, “Not because of you. Mostly because he’s annoying and nobody likes being marketed at.”

Eben nods once. “He’s a parasite.”

Noel whispers, delighted, “Eben said parasite.”

Eben’s eyes narrow. “Stop being happy.”

Noel tries. Fails.

Sam looks at me, quiet check. “Still okay.”

I swallow. The headline still exists. The violation still happened. But the bakery is warm. The room is small. The people are… on my side.

“Yes,” I say. “I’m okay.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

Noel presses his hands together like a little villain. “Now. Gifts.”

I go cold. “No.”

Noel’s eyes widen. “Yes.”

Eben says, “No.”

Noel looks at Eben. “Yes.”

Eben’s face stays blank. “I will leave.”

Noel slams a small gift bag down on the table. “No one leaves.”

Eben stares at the bag like it’s a bomb.

Sam’s mouth tips. “Noel.”

Noel lifts both hands. “Small gifts. Tiny. Symbolic. Not emotional. I am normal.”

He pushes the gift bag toward me.

I stare at it, suspicious. “What is it.”

Noel whispers, “Open it.”

I don’t like being told what to do.

Which means I open it immediately.

Inside is a small enamel pin: a tiny cinnamon roll with a little crown on it.

I blink.

Noel says softly, “For your apron. Because you are the king of stubborn.”

My throat tightens.

I hate it.

I also… really don’t hate it.

I force out, rough, “Thanks.”

Noel’s eyes shine. “Okay.”

Eben makes a sound and slides a small box toward me without looking at me. “Here.”

I blink at him. “Eben.”

Eben’s jaw tightens. “Open it.”

I open it.

Inside: a simple keychain, heavy metal, engraved with the bakery logo Noel must’ve designed. Under it: **CANDLE & CRUMB.**

No flourish. No joke. Just… solid.

Eben’s voice is flat. “So you stop losing your keys.”

My chest tightens.

I swallow. “I don’t lose my keys.”

Eben stares. “You do.”

Noel whispers, “He noticed.”

Eben says, “Stop talking.”

I close the box carefully. “Thank you.”

Eben nods once like he’s accepted the transaction and is now emotionally bankrupt again.

Noel turns to Sam, shoving another bag at him. “Open.”

Sam opens it.

It’s a knitted scarf. Dark green. Simple. Actually nice.

Noel beams. “I made it.”

Eben mutters, “Lies.”

Noel points at Eben. “My aunt made it. But I *commissioned* it with love.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Thank you.”

Noel trembles with happiness, then turns to me with another bag.

I stare. “No.”

Noel whispers, “Yes.”

I take it reluctantly.

Inside is a small notebook, leather-bound, with a simple pressed-foil design of pine branches.

On the first page, Noel has written: **“PLANS THAT AREN’T PRISONS.”**

My throat tightens so hard it hurts.

Noel says quietly, “So you can write the things you want. The boundaries. The plans. The… whatever.”

I stare at the notebook like it might explode.

Then I force out, low, “That’s… actually useful.”

Noel grins, relieved. “Yes. Usefulness. I can do it.”

Sam looks at me, eyes steady.

I can feel it in the air: the possibility of gratitude turning into something worse, something softer.

So I do what I always do when I’m close to being emotionally honest.

I get up. “I’m making more coffee.”

Noel whispers, reverent, “He is overwhelmed.”

Eben says, “Stop narrating.”

Noel whispers, “Never.”

---

## Chapter 27: The Smallest Future

Later, Noel and Eben leave. Noel hugs me without asking, which earns him a sharp look and a quick step back, and he immediately apologizes with frantic sincerity.

“Sorry,” Noel blurts. “Habit. I’m learning.”

I nod once. “Okay.”

Noel smiles weakly. “That okay counts?”

I glare. “Don’t start.”

Noel laughs, then flees into the snow.

Eben pauses at the door and looks at me like he’s deciding whether to speak.

Then he says, low and blunt, “You handled it.”

I swallow. “Thanks.”

Eben nods once and leaves, coat snapping behind him.

The bakery quiets again.

Sam and I stand near the counter, the ovens cold, the lights soft.

I run my thumb over the notebook’s cover like I’m grounding myself.

Sam watches me for a beat. “You want to write the plan.”

I swallow. “Not today.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

I exhale, then admit, low, “I didn’t think Christmas could feel… like that.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Like what.”

“Not like a test,” I mutter.

Sam nods once. “Good.”

I swallow, throat tight. “Grant didn’t win.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “No.”

“He didn’t get to make it mine,” I say.

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “You didn’t let him.”

My chest aches.

I whisper, “I held your hand.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Yeah.”

I swallow. “And no one died.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “No.”

I stare at him, then finally say the thing I’ve been circling for days like it’s a trap.

“I want this,” I whisper. “But I want it… my way.”

Sam’s expression softens, serious and steady. “Okay. Tell me what your way is.”

Choice again.

I inhale.

“My way is slow,” I say. “My way is consent. My way is boring in public. My way is no photos. My way is… you don’t get to surprise me.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I swallow. “And my way is… if I say stop, you stop.”

Sam’s voice is immediate. “Always.”

My chest tightens, warm and terrified.

I whisper, “Okay.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “That okay counts.”

I roll my eyes because I refuse to cry in my bakery. “You’re ruining the word.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Okay.”

“Stop.”

“No.”

We stand there in the soft Christmas light, the town quiet outside for once, and the future doesn’t feel like a cliff.

It feels like a line I can draw and keep.

And for the first time in my life, the idea of being seen doesn’t feel like a sentence.

It feels like a choice.

**[STOP WRITING]**



## Chapter 28: The Notebook Lies in Wait

Christmas afternoon is the kind of quiet that feels illegal in this town.

No festival announcements. No carolers ambushing strangers. No Noel sprinting past my window like a glitter-coated cryptid.

Just snow, soft light, and the bakery downstairs sitting dark and still.

I sit at my kitchen table with the notebook Noel gave me.

I glare at it like it personally offended me.

Sam sits across from me, mug in hand, watching without hovering. He’s learned the difference between “support” and “pressure,” which is both rare and annoyingly attractive.

I tap the notebook. “I hate this.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “Writing.”

“Planning,” I correct. “Putting things into words makes them real.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

I exhale, then flip it open.

The first page stares back at me:

**PLANS THAT AREN’T PRISONS.**

Noel’s handwriting is dramatic, which is on-brand and unforgivable.

I pick up a pen.

My hand shakes slightly.

Sam doesn’t speak.

So I write anyway.

### RULES (WES)

1. No photos. Not of me. Not of us.
2. No public labels. Not yet.
3. No surprises. Ask first.
4. If I say stop, you stop. Immediately.
5. Neutral response to gossip. No feeding.
6. Public touch: my choice. Always.
7. Home is safe. Bakery is safe.

I stare at the list, throat tight, like I’ve just written a spell.

Sam’s voice is low. “Can I add one.”

My pulse spikes.

Choice again.

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam leans forward slightly, careful. “Add: ‘If you panic, you don’t have to explain. You just say it. And we leave.’”

My throat tightens.

I write it down before I can overthink it.

8. If I panic, I don’t have to explain. I say it. We leave.

I set the pen down.

My chest aches, warm and horrible.

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

And then, because the universe hates peace, my phone buzzes again.

This time it’s not Grant.

It’s Noel.

**NOEL:** DAY NINE EVENT HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED
**NOEL:** BECAUSE I AM A RESPONSIBLE ADULT
**NOEL:** IT IS NOW “COZY MOVIE NIGHT” AT THE INN
**NOEL:** YOU CAN COME AND SIT IN THE DARK AND NO ONE WILL LOOK AT YOU
**NOEL:** I HAVE CONTROLLED THE LIGHTING

I stare at the messages, deadpan.

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Controlled the lighting.”

“He thinks he’s a stage director,” I mutter.

Sam’s gaze stays warm. “Do you want to go.”

My stomach flips.

Movie night. Dark. Quiet. Public, but not bright. That’s… almost tolerable.

I exhale. “For one hour.”

Sam nods. “Okay. One.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

I glare at him. “Stop.”

“No.”

---

## Chapter 29: Movie Night and the Art of Not Being Perceived

The inn’s lounge looks like Noel broke in after hours and turned it into a winter-themed nest.

Blankets stacked like offerings. Candles everywhere, but the electric kind, because Eben apparently threatened arson if Noel used real flame again. A projector aimed at a white sheet hung across the far wall.

It’s cozy in a way that makes me suspicious.

Noel greets us at the door wearing glasses he does not need, holding a clipboard he definitely does not need.

“Welcome,” Noel whispers, like we’re in a library.

Eben stands behind him like a bouncer in a holiday sweater, arms crossed.

Noel points at the room. “Low light. Back row seating. Minimal eye contact. I have done everything you asked.”

I blink. “I asked for none of this.”

Noel nods solemnly. “And yet.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly.

I glare at him. “Don’t.”

Noel ushers us toward the back, where he has arranged two chairs slightly tucked behind a decorative plant.

A plant.

Noel has hidden me behind foliage.

I hate that it works.

We sit.

The movie starts, some cheesy Christmas romance with bad acting and fake snow. Everyone laughs at the corny parts, sighs at the dramatic parts, and shushes Hugh when he starts narrating.

Hugh gets shushed by Eben. Hugh lives.

Miracles happen daily here.

Sam sits beside me, close but not touching. Present without pressure. I can feel the warmth of him through fabric and it makes my skin prickle.

Halfway through, Noel brings cocoa around like a waiter in a fever dream.

He sets a mug in my hand and whispers, “No marshmallows. Too messy.”

“Thank you,” I whisper back, and immediately regret it because I’ve just rewarded him.

Noel’s eyes shine. He retreats before he cries.

Sam leans in slightly, voice low. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

And it’s true.

Because it’s dark. Because no one is staring. Because I’m not bracing for a camera flash.

And because, for once, I’m just… in a room with people without feeling like prey.

Toward the end of the movie, something quietly changes.

Not with the town.

With me.

Because my hand, resting on my leg, creeps closer to Sam’s.

I don’t even realize I’m doing it until my knuckles brush his.

Sam goes still.

He doesn’t move.

He waits.

Asks without words.

Choice.

My heart pounds.

Then I do the small thing, the safe thing.

I hook my pinky around his.

Just a pinky.

Not a declaration. Not a headline.

Sam’s pinky curls around mine, gentle and steady.

My chest tightens, warm and terrifying.

He doesn’t squeeze. Doesn’t tug. Doesn’t turn it into anything.

He just… holds.

And the stupid part is: nobody notices.

The movie ends. People clap ironically. Noel leaps up and announces, “WAS THAT NOT A MASTERPIECE OF EMOTIONAL TRUTH.”

Eben says, “No.”

Noel beams anyway.

We leave with the crowd, blending into winter coats and muffled laughter.

Outside, under the inn’s porch lights, Sam says quietly, “Pinky.”

I stare straight ahead. “Don’t.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I exhale. “Stop.”

“No.”

We walk back through the snow, and my pinky still feels like it has a pulse of its own.

Which is absurd.

But so am I, apparently.

---

## Chapter 30: Day Ten

Day Ten is “Snowed-In Market Day.”

Meaning the town has collectively decided to set up little booths in the square and sell crafts, cocoa, homemade candles, and other things people buy when they need to feel like life has meaning.

I am not selling anything.

I am not speaking to anyone.

I am not participating.

Noel texts at 9:02 a.m.

**NOEL:** YOU ARE PARTICIPATING
**NOEL:** YOUR BOOTH IS “BAKERY BOXES FOR CHARITY”
**NOEL:** PEOPLE BUY A BOX OF PASTRIES AND IT FUNDS THE FOOD BANK
**NOEL:** YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SPEAK
**NOEL:** I HAVE PRE-PRINTED SIGNS

I stare at the message.

Sam, sipping coffee, watches my face. “He’s doing it again.”

I mutter, “He’s doing it in a way that’s hard to argue with.”

Sam’s eyes warm. “Do you want to do it.”

My stomach flips.

Public. But controlled. For charity. No talking. Signs.

And the truth is: I like feeding people. It’s the one way I can be in the world without feeling exposed.

I exhale. “Yes. But… no photos.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

We set up the booth.

Noel has gone full production mode: warm lights, tasteful signage, a cash box, a little chalkboard that says **“PAY WHAT YOU WANT. FEED SOMEONE ELSE TOO.”**

I don’t have to talk much. People come up, smile, pay, leave with pastry boxes like they’re holding tiny miracles.

A few try to ask about the article.

I keep it boring.

“I don’t discuss my private life,” I say, and hand them a box.

Sam, nearby, redirects with calm efficiency.

Noel floats around managing everything like a glittery logistics demon.

Eben appears once, buys two boxes, and disappears again like a social ghost leaving evidence.

And then something happens I didn’t plan for.

A teen steps up, hands shoved in his pockets, face red from cold.

He points at the sign. “This really goes to the food bank.”

I nod. “Yes.”

He hesitates, then quietly says, “My mom uses it sometimes.”

My throat tightens.

He fumbles cash onto the table, too much, then tries to pull away like he’s embarrassed.

I stop him gently. “That’s too much.”

He shrugs, eyes down. “It’s fine.”

I swallow hard.

Then I do the only thing I know how to do when words are dangerous.

I slide the biggest box toward him. Extra pastries. No announcement. No pity. Just… more.

He looks up, startled.

I keep my voice flat. “Merry Christmas.”

His face changes. Softens.

“Thanks,” he mutters, and leaves fast.

My chest aches.

Sam’s voice is low beside me. “That was good.”

I swallow. “It was nothing.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “It was something.”

I exhale, shaky. “Stop making it meaningful.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

## Chapter 31: Day Eleven

Day Eleven is supposed to be “Midnight Sleigh Ride.”

Noel is obsessed with it. Something about “old-fashioned romance” and “twinkle-light intimacy.”

I hate sleighs. I hate horses. I hate being trapped in a moving vehicle with other humans.

Noel knows this.

So Noel texts me:

**NOEL:** YOUR SLEIGH IS PRIVATE
**NOEL:** IT IS JUST YOU AND SAM
**NOEL:** I HAVE MADE THIS A BOUNDARY-COMPLIANT EVENT
**NOEL:** YOU’RE WELCOME

I stare at the message, deadpan.

Sam reads over my shoulder and says, calm, “Private sleigh.”

I mutter, “He is unwell.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

And the worst part is… I want it.

Not because I’m suddenly a romantic.

Because it’s contained. Dark. Quiet. Cold air. No crowd.

And because it’s with Sam, and I’m starting to understand that being with him doesn’t make me smaller.

It makes me steadier.

So I say it, low. “We can do it.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

---

## Chapter 32: Sleigh

The sleigh is parked at the edge of town near the tree farm, lanterns glowing softly, snow blanketing the ground like the world’s quietest threat.

The driver is an older man with a beard like a snowdrift who looks like he’s seen everything.

He looks at us, then pointedly looks away like he doesn’t care.

I love him.

We climb in. Blankets. Warmth. The horse snorts like it’s judging us.

The sleigh starts moving, bells ringing softly.

The town lights fade behind us. The trees close in. The night goes quiet in the way that makes my whole body loosen.

Sam sits close, not touching at first.

Then, after a minute, he asks quietly, “Tether.”

My heart pounds.

I stare at his gloved hand.

Choice.

I exhale slowly, then slip two fingers into his palm.

Sam’s hand closes gently, warm and steady even through leather.

We ride like that under the stars, the sleigh gliding, the world quiet.

Sam leans in slightly, voice low. “You did something tonight.”

I stare straight ahead. “What.”

Sam’s gaze stays steady. “You chose comfort.”

My throat tightens.

I mutter, “Don’t make it inspirational.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

The horse snorts again, like it approves.

The driver hums an off-key carol under his breath.

The sleigh keeps moving through the dark.

And for the first time in my life, Christmas feels less like a spotlight and more like a blanket.

When we return to town, the square is quiet, most people asleep, lights still twinkling like the town refuses to stop performing even when no one is watching.

Sam walks me back to the bakery.

At the door, he pauses, gaze steady. “Still okay.”

My chest is tight in a different way now. Warm. Full.

“Yes,” I say. “I’m okay.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

Then he kisses me, brief and careful in the snow, like a promise that doesn’t demand anything.

I kiss him back, then pull away first, because control still matters.

Sam doesn’t complain.

He just says, low, “Goodnight.”

I whisper, “Goodnight.”

I go inside, lock the door, lean against it, and stare into the quiet.

My fingers still remember his.

And the terrifying part is: I don’t want to forget.

**[STOP WRITING]**



## Chapter 33: Day Twelve, Twelfth Night, and Other Threats

Day Twelve arrives with the kind of crisp, bright cold that makes everything look cleaner than it is.

The town schedule board in Evergreen Square reads:

**TWELFTH NIGHT: THE STARLIGHT SOCIAL**
**Dress warm. Dress festive. Dress like you’re not terrified of feelings.**
(Last line absolutely added by Noel.)

My phone buzzes at 9:11 a.m.

**NOEL:** FINAL EVENT
**NOEL:** LOW LIGHT
**NOEL:** LIVE JAZZ TRIO (THEY ARE TAME)
**NOEL:** NO PHOTOS (I SWEAR ON MY SCARF COLLECTION)
**NOEL:** YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND A PLANT AGAIN IF YOU WANT

I stare at it.

Sam, standing at my sink rinsing mugs like he’s been doing it forever, glances over. “Plant again.”

I mutter, “He thinks foliage is a privacy policy.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

“Stop.”

“No.”

I look at the schedule again.

Twelfth Night means people will be out. The inn will be full. The town will be… itself. Warm and nosy and relentlessly hopeful.

My stomach flips.

Sam turns slightly, voice low. “You don’t have to go.”

I swallow. “I know.”

He waits. Doesn’t fill the space with encouragement. Doesn’t do the “you can do it” speech. Just waits like my choices matter even when they scare me.

I exhale slowly.

“I want to go,” I admit. “But I want… an exit.”

Sam nods once. “Okay. We make an exit plan.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

I glare at him. “Stop.”

“No.”

I grab Noel’s notebook off the table and flip to a fresh page.

### TWELFTH NIGHT PLAN

* Arrive late
* Stay 45 minutes
* Stand near a wall
* No photos
* Two-finger tether allowed
* If panic: leave. No explanation.

I underline **leave** twice, like that’s going to stop my nervous system from being dramatic.

Sam reads it, then adds one line in neat handwriting beneath mine:

* If someone tries to corner you: I intervene. You don’t have to.

My throat tightens.

I stare at his handwriting like it’s evidence of something I’m not ready to name.

I swallow. “Okay.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “That okay counts.”

I roll my eyes hard enough to injure my soul. “You’re going to say it until I die.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

“Stop.”

“No.”

---

## Chapter 34: The Starlight Social

The inn has been transformed into Noel’s idea of elegant.

Which is to say: twinkle lights, pine garlands, candles that are definitely electric because Eben has veto power now, and a small jazz trio tucked in the corner playing something soft and nostalgic.

The whole room smells like mulled cider and expensive perfume and other people’s ability to enjoy life.

Noel sees us enter and does a visible inhale like he’s about to scream.

Eben appears behind him instantly.

“Noel,” Eben says.

Noel clamps his mouth shut, eyes shining, and just gestures wildly toward the back wall where Noel has, no joke, set up “quiet seating.”

There are chairs. In shadow. Next to a large decorative plant.

I stare at it.

Sam’s mouth tips. “He’s consistent.”

I mutter, “He’s insane.”

We take the seats.

It’s dim enough that no one’s really looking at us. People are focused on the music, the drinks, the sparkle of it all. Conversations bubble like soft static.

I can breathe.

For the first ten minutes, I just… exist in a room.

And the room doesn’t eat me.

Sam sits beside me, close but not touching. His knee is near mine, warm through fabric, and my body keeps wanting to lean like it’s learned something it shouldn’t.

He glances at me, low. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he says, and it’s so steady it makes my chest ache again.

I hate how often my chest aches lately. It’s like my body is developing emotions. Disgusting.

---

### The unavoidable part

A woman I vaguely recognize from the gingerbread contest drifts by, drink in hand, eyes scanning.

She spots me. Her face brightens.

“Oh! Wes,” she says, too warmly. “Glad to see you out.”

My stomach tightens.

Neutral, neutral, neutral.

“Hi,” I say, flat and polite.

She leans in slightly, like she’s about to say the thing.

Sam shifts, smooth as a door closing, and says calmly, “Evening.”

The woman’s eyes flick to Sam. Then back to me. She smiles wider like she thinks she’s discovered a secret.

“So,” she says, voice dropping, “the article was…”

I feel my shoulders start to rise.

Sam cuts in, gentle but firm. “We’re not discussing it.”

The woman blinks. “I’m just saying, it was—”

Sam’s voice stays even. “Enjoy the party.”

Not angry. Not threatening. Just… a line.

The woman flushes, mutters, “Right, of course,” and glides away.

My hands are shaking.

Sam doesn’t touch me. He just leans in, low. “You don’t have to fight it.”

I swallow. “I didn’t.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “No. You stayed.”

My throat tightens.

“Stop making it meaningful,” I whisper.

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

“Stop.”

“No.”

---

## Chapter 35: Dance

The jazz trio shifts into something slow.

Couples drift to the small cleared space near the center of the room. Some people sway like they’ve rehearsed being soft.

Noel notices and looks like he’s about to implode.

Eben’s presence clamps down on him like gravity.

Noel doesn’t move. He just watches with the intensity of a man witnessing prophecy.

Sam glances at the dance floor, then back at me.

He doesn’t ask right away. He lets the question exist in the air first, like he’s giving my nerves time to vote.

Then, quietly: “Do you want to dance.”

My stomach flips.

Public. Visible. Not hidden behind a plant.

My first instinct is a clean, immediate no.

But my body also remembers the sleigh. The rink. The candle walk. The market booth.

Small steps.

Chosen.

I swallow hard. “In the dark.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “We can stand near the edge.”

I exhale. “No spinning. No… show.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he says, and his voice is so calm it almost makes me brave.

We stand.

We move to the edge of the dance floor, where the light is lower and people aren’t facing us directly.

Sam holds out his hand, palm up.

He waits.

Choice.

My heart pounds.

I place my hand in his.

Full hand this time. Not two fingers.

Sam’s other hand settles lightly at my side, not pressing, just there. His touch asks permission even when it doesn’t.

I exhale, shaky.

Sam’s voice is low in my ear. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

He starts moving, slow, guiding me into the rhythm.

It’s not performance dancing. It’s barely dancing at all. More like swaying, like we’re trying to convince the world this is casual.

But my body knows the truth.

My chest is tight. Warm. Alive.

I keep my gaze angled down, avoiding faces, but I can feel people around us and none of them are reacting like we’re scandal.

A couple people glance and smile and go back to their drinks.

No one claps. No one points. No one owns it.

And the realization hits hard: the town isn’t the cage.

The cage was always inside me.

Sam murmurs, “You’re doing it.”

I grit my teeth. “Don’t.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Okay.”

We sway through one song.

Then another starts.

Sam leans in. “Do you want to stop.”

Choice.

I swallow.

I should stop. I planned forty-five minutes. I planned a wall. I planned minimal exposure.

But I’m warm and steady and not falling apart.

I whisper, “One more.”

Sam nods. “Okay. One more.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

We sway through the second song.

Near the end, I finally lift my gaze, just enough to meet his eyes.

Sam is watching me like I matter.

Not like a project. Not like a fragile thing. Just… me.

My throat tightens.

I whisper, “Don’t look at me like that.”

Sam’s brows lift slightly. “Like what.”

“Like you’re… staying,” I mutter.

Sam’s voice is steady. “I am.”

My chest aches so sharply I almost pull away.

Instead, I do the most reckless thing I’ve done all week.

I press my forehead briefly to his shoulder.

One second.

Then I pull back like it didn’t happen.

Sam doesn’t comment. Doesn’t trap me with it. He just keeps swaying, steadying the world around my shaking edges.

The song ends.

I exhale hard.

Sam leans in, low. “Do you want to leave.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

We slip out quietly, coats on, no announcements.

Noel spots us leaving and puts both hands over his mouth to prevent a cheer.

Eben nods once at us like an approving bouncer.

We leave.

And the night doesn’t follow us.

---

## Chapter 36: Outside the Inn

Snow falls lightly as we step onto the porch.

The air is cold enough to sting, which helps. Cold is honest. Cold doesn’t pretend to want anything from you.

Sam stands beside me, hands in his coat pockets.

I breathe in, slow.

I made it.

I didn’t run.

I didn’t snap.

I didn’t vanish.

I danced. In public. Like a person.

The realization makes my stomach flip again.

Sam’s voice is quiet. “You did what you planned.”

I huff. “I danced.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Yes.”

I stare at the streetlights. “That was… too much.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

I turn sharply. “But I also… didn’t hate it.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Good.”

I swallow hard. “I don’t know what that means.”

Sam’s expression stays steady. “It means you’re allowed to want.”

My throat tightens.

I look away fast because the word *want* is dangerous.

Then I force it out anyway, low and raw: “I want you.”

Sam doesn’t move. He doesn’t grab. He doesn’t rush.

He just asks, soft: “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

He steps closer, slow, and kisses me under the porch light. Brief. Careful. Warm.

No audience. No spectacle.

Just the kind of touch that doesn’t take anything I didn’t offer.

I kiss him back, then pull away first, because control still matters.

Sam lets me.

Of course he does.

I exhale, shaky laugh. “This is ridiculous.”

Sam’s mouth tips. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

We walk back to the bakery together, snow catching in our hair.

And for once, the future doesn’t look like a trap.

It looks like a line I can keep drawing.

One choice at a time.

One hand at a time.




## Chapter 37: The Morning After the Plant

We get back to Candle & Crumb and the whole building feels like it exhales with me.

Not because it’s magic. Because it’s mine. Because I know every creak in the stairs, every draft around the window frame, every place the floorboards complain.

Sam hangs his coat the same way he always does now. Quiet. Neat. Like he’s not trying to take up space he hasn’t been given.

I set my keys down and stare at them for a second like I’m expecting them to start screaming.

Sam’s voice is low. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he says, like he’s carved the word into his bones.

I go upstairs without saying much because my brain is full of the dance. Full hand. My forehead against his shoulder. Me leaving first because I still need control like oxygen.

Sam follows without pushing, like he’s learned the pace of my fear.

Inside my apartment, the quiet hits again. It should be relief.

Instead, it’s the aftershock.

Because the public part is over, and now my brain wants to replay everything that could’ve gone wrong.

“What if someone saw.”
“What if someone posts.”
“What if Grant writes another update.”
“What if I did too much.”

I pace once, then stop because pacing makes it worse.

Sam watches me, steady.

“You were good,” he says.

I laugh once, sharp. “That’s not helpful.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “Okay.”

I point. “Stop.”

“No.”

I turn away, then blurt, because apparently I’ve decided honesty is my new hobby. “I danced.”

Sam’s gaze warms. “Yes.”

“In public,” I add, like I’m confessing a crime.

Sam nods once. “Yes.”

I swallow hard. “And I didn’t die.”

Sam’s eyes soften. “No.”

My chest tightens. “I don’t know what that means.”

Sam steps closer, slow, like he’s approaching a wild animal that might bolt. “It means you can be seen and still be safe.”

My throat tightens.

I hate that the words land.

I whisper, rough, “I don’t trust it.”

Sam’s voice is steady. “You don’t have to trust the whole world. Just the plan.”

I stare at him.

Then I nod once, because nodding is easier than speaking when my throat feels like it’s full of glass.

Sam’s gaze stays on mine. “Do you want quiet.”

I exhale. “Yes.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

He doesn’t move to touch me. He just sits on the couch, back straight, hands relaxed, waiting like a man who understands that quiet is sometimes intimacy.

I sit too, leaving a careful gap between us that I hate needing.

The gap shrinks on its own. My shoulder brushes his.

He still doesn’t move.

Choice.

I lean in until my head rests against his shoulder.

One second.

Two.

Sam’s hand hovers near my back, then he asks, almost too soft to hear. “Touch.”

My throat tightens.

I whisper, “Yes.”

His hand settles on my shoulder, warm and steady through fabric.

And my body finally stops bracing like it’s waiting for impact.

---

## Chapter 38: The Boring Truth

In the morning, the town wakes up like it always does: hungry, nosy, and convinced it’s entitled to a story.

I wake up like I always do: tense, alert, and ready to fight a headline.

Sam is already awake. Of course he is.

He looks over when I sit up, voice low. “Still okay.”

I blink at him, then exhale. “Yes.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter automatically, then stop.

Because I just said it like it’s mine now.

Sam’s mouth tips slightly, warm. “It counts.”

I groan and roll out of bed.

Downstairs, the bakery smells like cold flour and yesterday’s sugar, which is comforting in the way only routine is.

I unlock the door. Flip the sign.

OPEN.

And the second the bell chimes, the world returns.

The first few customers are regulars. They order normally. They smile normally. They pretend they don’t know anything.

Then, of course, someone tries it.

A tourist in a bright coat steps up, phone already half-raised in that “I’m just casually holding this” way.

I feel the old heat rise in my chest.

Sam is near the front, “on patrol,” calm and sharp.

The tourist smiles. “Hey, you’re the baker from that article.”

I keep my face flat. “I’m the baker.”

The tourist laughs like I’m being cute. “Right, but like… the *story.*”

I feel my teeth sharpen.

Then I remember the notebook. The plan. The line.

I take a slow breath. “There is no story.”

The tourist blinks. “But it said—”

Sam’s voice cuts in, calm and final. “No photos.”

The tourist’s smile wobbles. “I wasn’t—”

Sam doesn’t raise his voice. He doesn’t threaten. He just holds the boundary like it’s weather. “No photos.”

The tourist lowers his phone, flustered. “Okay. Sorry.”

I ring him up. Hand him a bag. End of interaction.

The tourist leaves.

The bakery keeps breathing.

I didn’t explode.

I didn’t collapse.

I stayed boring.

It’s ridiculous how powerful boring can be.

Sam glances at me, quick check. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

And I hate that I’m starting to believe it.

---

## Chapter 39: The Line in the Snow

That evening, after the last tray is cleaned and the door is locked, I sit at the back table with the notebook open.

Sam stands by the sink, rinsing a mug like he’s trying to be useful without being in the way.

I tap the pen against the paper, then write:

### WHAT I WANT (WES)

* A life that isn’t a rumor.
* A relationship that isn’t public property.
* To stop flinching when someone looks at me.
* To choose touch without bracing.

I stare at the last line like it’s too honest.

Sam’s voice comes softly from the sink. “You can.”

I swallow. “I did. Twice.”

Sam’s mouth tips slightly. “More than twice.”

I glare. “Don’t count.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “Okay.”

I exhale, then add another section.

### WHAT I CAN OFFER (WES)

* Slow.
* Honest.
* Private.
* Consistent.
* Trying.

My throat tightens on the last word.

Trying sounds small.

Trying is also everything.

Sam sits across from me without asking, careful about the chair, careful about distance.

He nods toward the notebook. “Can I read.”

Choice again.

I swallow. “Yes.”

He reads quietly. No commentary. No smugness. No “good job.”

When he looks up, his eyes are steady and warm. “This is enough.”

My chest tightens. “It doesn’t feel like enough.”

Sam’s voice is calm. “It is. Because it’s real.”

I stare at him, then whisper the thing that scares me because it’s not clever. It’s not armored. It’s simple.

“What do you want.”

Sam doesn’t hesitate. “You. And your terms. And time.”

My throat tightens.

“And,” he adds, careful, “I want to be allowed to exist in your life without you having to earn it every day.”

My stomach flips.

I whisper, rough, “I don’t know how to stop earning.”

Sam’s gaze holds mine. “Then start by letting yourself keep what you already did. The dance. The hand. The line.”

I swallow hard.

Outside, snow falls quietly.

Inside, the world is warm.

I look down at the notebook and write one last line under everything:

* I don’t have to disappear to be safe.

My hand shakes as I write it.

Then I set the pen down like I’ve finished a battle.

Sam’s voice is low. “Still okay.”

I breathe in.

This time, the answer doesn’t feel like bravery.

It feels like a decision.

“Yes,” I say. “I’m okay.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter, but there’s less bite in it now.

“It counts,” he says, and reaches across the table, palm up.

He waits.

Choice.

I slide my fingers into his, full hand this time, and hold on.

Not because I’m trapped.

Because I want to.

And the line in the snow holds.



## Chapter 40: The Hand That Stays

Sam’s hand in mine makes the bakery feel smaller in the best way. Like the room isn’t full of traps. Like the air isn’t waiting to turn.

I don’t squeeze hard. I don’t cling. I just… hold.

Sam doesn’t move like he’s trying to turn this into a moment. He doesn’t smile like he’s won. He just sits there, steady, letting my choice be what it is.

After a minute, I whisper, rough, “This is new.”

Sam’s thumb brushes once over my knuckles, barely there. “Yeah.”

My chest tightens anyway. I look down at our hands, then mutter, “Don’t get used to me being… like this.”

Sam’s voice stays calm. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

He doesn’t say “I love it.” He doesn’t say “I always knew you’d soften.” He doesn’t say any of the things that would make my skin crawl and my walls slam back up.

He just stays.

Which is, honestly, the most terrifying form of kindness.

I let go first, because I still need to. Because control is part of how I breathe.

Sam doesn’t react. Doesn’t chase the contact. Doesn’t punish me with distance.

He just nods toward the notebook. “Do you want to add anything else.”

I swallow. “Yeah.”

I pick up the pen and write one more line, under the rules.

9. If I let you in, don’t sprint.

My hand shakes as I finish it, like my body doesn’t trust me with my own truth.

Sam reads it and nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he says, and the quiet warmth of it makes me want to throw the notebook out the window.

Instead, I close it gently, like it’s something fragile I’m learning how to keep.

---

## Chapter 41: The Corrective

The next morning, the update hits.

Not from Grant.

From the site that published him.

Noel slams his phone on the counter like he’s presenting evidence in court. “LOOK.”

I stare. “Volume.”

Noel whispers louder. “SORRY. LOOK.”

I take the phone.

At the top of the article, there’s a new editor’s note:

**Editor’s note: We have removed language that speculated on private individuals’ relationships. Our coverage will focus on public events and community programs.**

My stomach drops, but not in the panic way. In the *relief is suspicious* way.

Sam, near the door, watches my face. “They edited it.”

I swallow. “Why.”

Noel grins like a maniac. “Because Eben knows a lawyer.”

Eben’s voice from behind Noel is flat. “I know someone who knows someone.”

I blink. “Eben.”

Eben avoids eye contact. “He crossed a line.”

Noel whispers, reverent, “Eben has a soft core.”

Eben’s stare is lethal. “Stop breathing.”

Noel beams anyway.

I stare at the editor’s note again. My throat tightens.

Sam’s voice goes low. “Still okay.”

I swallow, and it surprises me that my answer comes out steady. “Yes.”

Because it’s not a full win. It doesn’t erase what happened. But it’s the world, for once, admitting that I’m not public property.

That matters.

And I hate how much it matters.

Noel whispers, “Grant is so mad.”

Eben says, “Good.”

I hand the phone back like it burns.

“Okay,” I mutter.

Sam’s mouth tips. “That okay counts.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

---

## Chapter 42: The Town’s Version of Quiet

The rest of the week after Twelfth Night is the town exhaling.

The big events are over. The tourists thin out. The schedule board comes down. The square stays lit anyway because Noel refuses to accept darkness.

Business stays steady, but the edge of gossip dulls. People stop trying to test the boundary.

A couple customers still smile too knowingly at Sam when he steps in to grab coffee.

Sam stays boring. I stay boring.

It works.

One afternoon, Mrs. Alden comes in, orders her usual, then pauses and says, very casually, “I saw you dancing.”

My stomach drops.

I brace.

Mrs. Alden continues, still casual. “You looked happy.”

My chest tightens so hard it hurts.

I keep my face flat. “I was… not unhappy.”

Mrs. Alden nods like that’s the correct amount of honesty for a man like me. “Good.”

Then she adds, like she’s discussing the weather, “And that writer fellow can go chew ice.”

I blink.

Mrs. Alden smiles sweetly, takes her bag, and leaves.

No drama. No lecture. No demand for a story.

Just… a tiny piece of protection from someone who has absolutely decided I’m hers to defend in the way a town defends its own.

My hands shake under the counter anyway.

Sam catches my eye, calm. “Still okay.”

I swallow. “Yes.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he agrees.

And I realize something quietly awful: being cared about by a community doesn’t always feel like a spotlight.

Sometimes it feels like a wall at your back.

---

## Chapter 43: The First Ordinary Night

The first truly ordinary night after the festival feels wrong.

No sleigh. No candle walk. No market booth. No Noel scheduling “emotional milestones” like he’s running a lab.

Just snow outside and the bakery quiet inside.

I lock up, head upstairs, and find Sam already there, sitting on my couch with his boots off, reading a paperback like he lives here.

My chest tightens.

He looks up. “Hey.”

“Hey,” I mutter.

Sam closes the book without snapping it shut like it’s a declaration. “How was today.”

I shrug, then realize that’s not enough anymore. “Quiet. Better.”

Sam nods once. “Good.”

I hover near the doorway like I’m not sure I’m allowed to enter my own room when someone else is in it.

Sam watches me for a beat, then asks softly, “Do you want space.”

Choice.

I exhale. “No.”

Sam nods. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter.

“It counts,” he says.

I step closer, slow, then sit beside him with a careful inch of distance that I hate.

Sam doesn’t close it. He waits.

My shoulder drifts into his. Not on purpose. Not not on purpose either.

He stays still.

I mutter, “I don’t know what we are.”

Sam’s voice is steady. “We’re whatever you can hold.”

My throat tightens.

I hate that answer. I love that answer.

I whisper, “I can hold… this.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

I glare. “Stop.”

“No.”

I lean my head against his shoulder and let my eyes close.

It’s quiet.

It’s safe.

And the most ridiculous part is: nobody had to earn it tonight. Not me. Not him. It’s just… here.

## Chapter 44: New Year’s, Small and Stubborn

New Year’s Eve in Tinsel Town is technically an “event,” but it’s not the festival kind. It’s smaller. Local. People who know each other and don’t need to perform as hard.

Noel still tries, obviously, but Eben keeps him on a short leash.

I stay open late for the “midnight cocoa crowd,” which is mostly parents and night-shift workers and people who don’t drink but still want to mark the year changing.

Sam is there, in plain clothes, sitting at the back table with coffee, reading.

And that’s the thing.

He’s not “on patrol.”

He’s not hovering.

He’s just… there.

A couple people nod at him. A couple nod at me. No one makes it weird. When someone starts to, Sam’s gaze goes flat and it dies in their throat.

At 11:58, Noel bursts in with Hugh and Eben like an invading force.

Noel has a party popper. Hugh has champagne. Eben has the dead-eyed resignation of a man who agreed to this under duress.

Noel stage-whispers, “COUNTDOWN IN THE BAKERY.”

I stare. “No.”

Noel grins. “Yes.”

Eben says, “No.”

Noel grins wider. “Yes.”

The little crowd in the bakery starts counting anyway, because humans love being told what to do in groups.

Ten.

Nine.

Eight.

I stand behind the counter, arms crossed, pretending I’m not participating.

Sam stands a few feet away, watching me like he’s ready to leave if it becomes too much.

Five.

Four.

Three.

My chest tightens because here comes the part where people hug and kiss and get loud and public.

Two.

One.

Cheering.

Noel yells, “HAPPY NEW YEAR,” like he’s trying to summon fireworks indoors.

Hugh kisses the air dramatically. Eben looks like he wants to die.

And Sam?

Sam doesn’t reach for me.

He just looks at me, steady, and asks quietly, “Tether.”

Choice.

In the middle of my bakery. With people around. With noise and light and the year changing.

I swallow hard.

Then, because I’m tired of being ruled by fear, I step out from behind the counter and take his hand.

Full hand.

Not two fingers.

Not pinky.

Full.

The room doesn’t explode.

No one screams.

Noel, of course, sees it and goes rigid with delight, but Eben clamps him down with a hand on his shoulder.

Noel doesn’t say a word.

I’m almost proud of him.

Sam’s thumb brushes my knuckles once, gentle.

He doesn’t kiss me. Doesn’t turn it into a performance.

He just holds my hand while the bakery cheers at midnight.

And for the first time, the new year feels like something I’m walking into instead of surviving.

Sam leans in, low. “Still okay.”

My throat tightens.

“Yeah,” I whisper. “I’m okay.”

Sam nods once. “Okay.”

“That okay counts,” I mutter, but I’m smiling when I say it.

“It counts,” he replies.

And the warmth in my chest doesn’t feel like a trap.

It feels like mine.
