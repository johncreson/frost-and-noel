## Chapter 3: Caroling Prep

The afternoon was cold enough that Noel could see his breath, which felt appropriate given that everything else about today had been aggressively uncomfortable.

Evergreen Square was a hive of activity. Stage setup. Sound system. Volunteers hauling risers and stringing lights. The town's annual caroling night was in three hours, and Noel was determined to make it perfect.

Mostly because if he focused on work, he didn't have to think about the way Eben had looked right through him this morning.

The square was beautiful, at least. Someone had strung fairy lights between the lampposts, creating a canopy of warm gold that would look magical once the sun set. The stage was draped in evergreen garland. The air smelled like pine and cinnamon from the bakery across the street, where Wes was probably already prepping cookies for the post-caroling reception.

It was exactly the kind of cozy, picture-perfect scene that Tinsel Town did best.

Noel felt like he was going to throw up.

"Noel!" One of the volunteers waved him over. "Where do you want the cider station?"

"Near the stage, but not blocking sightlines. Maybe there?" He pointed to a spot that would work. "And make sure there's a clear path for people to refill. We don't want a bottleneck."

"Got it!"

Noel checked his clipboard. Cider station. Check. Risers. Check. Lights—still in progress. Sound system—

He looked across the square. Eben was at the tech table, headphones on, testing levels. Focused. Competent. Completely in his element.

Also still not looking at Noel.

Noel's chest tightened. They'd been in the same space for three hours now, and Eben had managed to avoid direct eye contact the entire time. It was impressive, really. The kind of precision avoidance that required active effort.

Which meant Eben was thinking about him.

Which meant—what? That he regretted last night? That he was embarrassed? That he wanted to pretend it never happened?

Noel didn't know. And he hated not knowing.

"You two are telepathic now. It's creepy."

Noel jumped. Hugh had appeared at his elbow, arms full of garland and somehow already covered in glitter despite the event not starting for hours.

"What?"

"You and Frost. You're working like a machine. It's unnatural." Hugh dumped the garland on a nearby table. "Also, you're both miserable. So that's fun."

"I'm not miserable."

"You're smiling. You're always smiling when you're miserable. It's your tell."

Noel's smile didn't waver. "I'm fine."

"Liar." Hugh leaned against the table, studying him. "What happened?"

"Nothing happened."

"Noel."

"Hugh."

They stared at each other. Hugh caved first, sighing dramatically.

"Fine. Don't tell me. But for the record, whatever's going on between you two is obvious to literally everyone except apparently you two."

Noel's stomach dropped. "There's nothing going on."

"Sure. And I don't have glitter in my hair." Hugh picked a piece of silver glitter off Noel's shoulder. "Mayor Kringle already asked me if you two were dating. I said no, but he didn't believe me."

"We're not dating."

"I know. You're just pining. Separately. While working together. It's very tragic and also very annoying."

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again.

"I'm not pining."

"You're wearing his scarf."

Noel's hand went to his neck. He was, in fact, wearing a scarf. A charcoal gray scarf that he'd grabbed from his apartment this morning because he'd forgotten his own.

Except it wasn't his. It was Eben's. He'd left it in Noel's apartment two days ago, and Noel had—

Oh god. He was wearing Eben's scarf.

In public.

Where everyone could see.

"I—this isn't—"

"It's fine. It looks good on you. Very 'I'm emotionally compromised but make it fashion.'" Hugh patted his shoulder. "Just maybe talk to him? Before the event? Because the tension is so thick I could cut it with a candy cane."

Hugh walked away before Noel could respond.

Noel stood there, hand still on the scarf, feeling like an idiot.

He should take it off. He should absolutely take it off.

He didn't take it off.

The scarf was soft. Warm. It smelled like Eben's cologne—something clean and understated that Noel had noticed the first time they'd worked together and had been trying very hard not to think about ever since.

He was failing spectacularly at not thinking about it.

Across the square, Eben adjusted a microphone stand. His movements were precise. Efficient. He'd taken off his coat, rolled up his sleeves despite the cold. Noel could see the line of his forearms, the careful way he handled the equipment.

Noel looked away before Eben could catch him staring.

This was fine. He was fine. They had a job to do, and Noel was going to do it, and he was not going to think about the way Eben's hands had felt on his skin or the way he'd said "Look at me" like it mattered or the way he'd left without saying goodbye.

He was absolutely not thinking about any of that.

---

An hour later, the square was ready. Lights strung. Stage set. Sound system tested. The crowd was starting to gather, bundled in coats and scarves, breath misting in the cold air.

Noel stood near the stage, checking his notes. Everything was in place. This was going to be fine.

"Noel! Eben!" Mayor Kringle appeared, beaming. "This looks wonderful! You two make quite the team."

"Thank you, Mayor," Noel said automatically.

Eben nodded from across the stage. Still not looking at Noel.

"Great chemistry!" The Mayor clapped Eben on the shoulder. "This will photograph beautifully. The town loves seeing you two work together."

Noel's smile felt like it was going to crack his face.

"We're happy to help," he said.

The Mayor wandered off, already greeting arriving townspeople. Noel risked a glance at Eben.

Eben was staring at his tablet like it held the secrets of the universe.

Noel looked away.

They worked in silence. Noel managed the volunteers. Eben handled the tech. They moved around each other like dancers who'd practiced this routine a hundred times.

It should have felt good. It felt awful.

Because they were good at this. They worked well together. They always had. And now there was this—thing—between them that neither of them was acknowledging, and Noel didn't know how to fix it.

He didn't know if Eben wanted to fix it.

A volunteer approached with a question about the choir risers. Noel answered. Checked his clipboard. Made a note.

Across the stage, Eben was doing the same thing. Answering questions. Solving problems. Being competent and professional and completely unavailable.

Noel wrapped the scarf tighter around his neck.

The sun was setting now, and the fairy lights were starting to glow. The square looked magical. The kind of scene that would photograph beautifully, just like the Mayor said.

Noel wondered if anyone would notice that he and Eben hadn't spoken directly to each other all afternoon.

Probably not. They were too good at this. Too practiced at working together without actually being together.

"Sound check in ten," Eben said, voice carrying across the stage.

"Got it," Noel called back.

Their eyes met for half a second. Eben looked away first.

Noel wrapped the scarf tighter around his neck and got back to work.

If the town thought they had chemistry, fine. Let them think that.

If only the town knew how spectacularly wrong it was going.
