## Chapter 1: The Morning After

Noel woke up alone, which was fine. Normal. The sheets on the other side were cold. Also fine. He was going to be absolutely, aggressively fine about this.

He stared at the ceiling for a solid minute, cataloging the evidence. Empty bed. No note. No text. The apartment was quiet in that specific way that meant he was the only person in it, and had been for a while.

Fine.

He rolled out of bed and padded to the kitchen. The coffee he'd set up last night—optimistic, that—was still waiting. He pressed the button and watched it brew, because apparently his brain had decided that staring at things was today's primary activity.

The coffee finished. He poured a cup. Drank it black because he couldn't be bothered to open the fridge.

It was cold.

Not the coffee. Well, yes, the coffee. But also the apartment. The air. The whole situation.

He was not disappointed. That would require him to have had expectations, and expectations required hope, and hope required—nope. Not going there. Coffee first. Spiral later.

Except his brain had other plans.

*Eben left.*

That was the fact. Eben had left sometime in the night—or early morning, more likely, given the precision with which he did everything—without waking Noel. Without saying anything. Without leaving so much as a Post-it note that said "had to go, talk later."

Which was fine. They were adults. They'd had sex. Good sex. Great sex, if Noel was being honest, which he was trying very hard not to be right now. And then Eben had left, because that's what people did. That's what Noel had expected.

Except he hadn't expected it. Not really. Not after the way Eben had looked at him. Not after "Are you okay?" and "I don't know" and the careful, deliberate way Eben had touched him like he mattered.

Noel set the coffee down before he could throw it.

He was not doing this. He was not spiraling over a guy who'd been clear from the start that this was temporary. That the festival was temporary. That everything about this situation had an expiration date stamped on it in bold red letters.

He took a shower. Got dressed. Chose his clothes with the kind of care that he absolutely was not putting into looking good for someone who'd already seen him naked. The green sweater. The good jeans. The boots that made him feel like he had his life together.

He looked in the mirror. He looked fine.

He felt like shit.

His phone sat on the counter, screen blank. No messages. No missed calls. Nothing.

Noel picked it up, opened his messages, and stared at Eben's name for a full thirty seconds before closing the app without typing anything.

What was he supposed to say? *Hey, thanks for last night, also why did you leave, also are we okay, also what are we?*

No. Absolutely not. That was not how Noel Merrick operated. He didn't chase. He didn't demand answers. He made himself useful and waited for people to come to him, and if they didn't, well. That told him everything he needed to know.

He grabbed his coat and headed out.

Merryweather Hall looked the same as it always did. Warm lights. Evergreen garlands. The faint smell of cinnamon and pine that seemed to live in the walls. Noel pushed through the front doors and immediately got swept into the chaos.

"Noel! Thank god." Hugh appeared at his elbow, glitter already somehow in his hair despite it being nine in the morning. "The caroling stage setup is a disaster. The vendor sent the wrong risers and Eben's about to have an aneurysm."

"Where is he?"

"Loading dock. I'd give him space if I were you. He's in full Frost mode."

Noel's stomach dropped. "Got it."

He didn't give Eben space. He went straight to the loading dock, because apparently self-preservation was not on today's agenda.

Eben was there, clipboard in hand, staring at a stack of metal risers like they'd personally offended him. He looked—fine. Composed. Professional. The same as always.

He also didn't look up when Noel walked in.

"Morning," Noel said, keeping his voice light.

"Morning." Eben's tone was crisp. Efficient. Distant.

Noel waited for more. Eye contact. A smile. Anything.

Eben made a note on his clipboard.

"So," Noel tried again. "Riser situation?"

"Wrong size. I'm handling it."

"Need help?"

"I've got it."

The words were fine. Professional. Exactly what Eben would say on any normal day. But this wasn't a normal day, and the way Eben still wasn't looking at him made Noel's chest tighten in a way that had nothing to do with the cold air coming through the open dock door.

"Eben—"

"I need to call the vendor." Eben turned away, phone already to his ear. "Excuse me."

Noel stood there for a moment, frozen, as Eben walked to the far corner of the dock and started a conversation that very clearly did not include him.

There it was. The familiar sinking feeling. The one that said *you were only worth something when you were useful, and now that the usefulness of last night is over—*

No. He was not going to spiral. Not yet. Not until he knew for certain.

Except he did know. Eben's body language was a neon sign that said *I'm pretending last night didn't happen, and I need you to do the same.*

Noel took a breath. Let it out. Turned and walked back into the Hall.

Hugh was waiting, eyes too knowing. "You okay?"

"Fine," Noel said automatically.

"Liar."

"Yep."

Hugh handed him a clipboard. "Caroling prep. You're on crowd management. Try not to murder anyone."

"No promises."

Noel took the clipboard and got to work, because that's what he did. He was useful. He was competent. He was absolutely, aggressively fine.

Even if Eben Frost was currently acting like last night had never happened.

Even if Noel's chest felt like someone had reached in and squeezed.

Even if he wanted to grab Eben by the shoulders and demand to know what the hell this was, because "I want to" and "Look at me" didn't lead to cold professionalism the next morning. They didn't.

But Noel didn't do that. He smiled at the volunteers. He organized the setup. He made himself useful.

And he tried very, very hard not to think about the way Eben had looked at him last night, like Noel was something worth keeping.

Apparently, he'd been wrong.
