## Chapter 2: The Distance

Eben Frost did not believe in regret. Regret was inefficient. It changed nothing and cost everything.

He was currently experiencing what could only be described as industrial-grade regret, and it was, in fact, changing nothing and costing everything.

He stared at his phone. The vendor was talking. Eben had no idea what they were saying. His entire consciousness was occupied by the fact that Noel had just walked away, and Eben had let him, and this was the right thing to do.

It didn't feel right.

It felt like he'd just taken something fragile and thrown it against a wall to see if it would break.

"Mr. Frost? Are you still there?"

"Yes," Eben said. "Send the correct risers by noon. Bill the error to your account."

He ended the call before they could argue.

The loading dock was empty now. Cold air poured through the open door. Eben should close it. He didn't move.

He'd left Noel's apartment at four in the morning because he couldn't handle waking up next to him. That was the truth. The simple, pathetic truth.

He'd woken up with Noel's head on his chest, one arm thrown across Eben's ribs, breathing slow and even. The apartment had been dark. Quiet. Warm.

Eben had felt—

No. He wasn't doing this.

He'd felt too much. That was the problem. He'd looked at Noel sleeping and thought *I could get used to this*, and that thought had sent him into a full-scale panic spiral that ended with him getting dressed in the dark and leaving like a coward.

Professional distance. That was the plan. Crisp. Efficient. Pretend last night was a one-time thing and move forward with the festival work.

Except Noel had looked at him with those warm eyes and asked if he needed help, and Eben had frozen like a malfunctioning robot and said *I've got it* in a tone that could freeze water.

He was doing a stellar job of pretending last night hadn't fundamentally rearranged his understanding of physical chemistry. Of emotional chemistry. Of chemistry generally.

Noel had looked hurt. Just for a second. Just a flash across his face before he'd smoothed it into something pleasant and professional.

Eben hated that he'd put that look there.

He also wasn't going to do anything about it, because this was the right call. The safe call. Noel didn't need to get tangled up in Eben's—whatever this was. Eben didn't need to get attached to someone he'd have to leave in two weeks.

The problem was that he was already tangled. Already attached. Already everything he'd promised himself he wouldn't be.

"Frost!"

Eben turned. Hugh was in the doorway, glitter catching the light like some kind of chaotic disco ball.

"What."

"Wow. Okay. Someone woke up on the wrong side of emotionally unavailable." Hugh crossed his arms. "Caroling prep. You're needed. Noel's handling the volunteers, but we need your tech brain for the sound system."

"I'll be there in five."

"You'll be there now. Also, whatever you did to Noel, fix it."

Eben's jaw tightened. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"Sure you don't. He's got that smile on. The one that means he's internally screaming. So either you two had a fight, or—" Hugh's eyes went wide. "Oh my god. You slept together."

"That's none of your business."

"You did! And now you're doing the thing where you panic and go all ice king. Eben. Buddy. That is the worst possible move."

"I'm not discussing this with you."

"You're not discussing it with anyone, which is the problem." Hugh stepped closer, voice dropping. "Look. I don't know what happened. But Noel's a good guy. He doesn't deserve to be frozen out."

Eben knew that. He knew that. It didn't change the fact that distance was safer. For both of them.

"I'm handling it," Eben said.

"Are you, though?"

No. He absolutely was not.

"Five minutes," Eben said, and walked past Hugh before he could say anything else.

The main hall was organized chaos. Volunteers everywhere. Boxes of decorations. The faint smell of pine and something baking from the kitchen. Eben scanned the room and found Noel immediately, because apparently his brain had decided that Noel-tracking was now a primary function.

Noel was at the far end, talking to a group of volunteers. Smiling. Gesturing. Looking completely at ease.

Except Eben knew that smile now. Knew the difference between Noel's real smile and the one he used when he was performing. This was performance.

Eben's chest tightened.

He forced himself to look away. Focused on the sound system setup. The equipment was standard. Easy. He could do this in his sleep.

He got to work.

Twenty minutes later, Noel appeared at his elbow.

"Hugh said you needed the stage layout for the speaker placement."

Eben didn't look up. "Yeah. Thanks."

Noel set the paper down. Didn't leave.

Eben kept his eyes on the equipment.

"Eben."

That voice. Quiet. Careful. The one that meant Noel was about to ask a question Eben didn't want to answer.

"I'm busy."

"I know. I just—" Noel stopped. Started again. "Are we okay?"

No. They were not okay. Eben had ruined this before it even started, and he didn't know how to fix it without making it worse.

"We're fine," Eben said.

The lie tasted like ash.

"Okay," Noel said softly. "Good."

He walked away.

Eben watched him go. Watched the careful set of his shoulders. The way he smiled at someone across the room like nothing was wrong.

Eben turned back to the sound system and tried to remember why distance was supposed to be the right choice.

He couldn't.
