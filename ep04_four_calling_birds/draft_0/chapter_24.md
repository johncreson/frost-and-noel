## Chapter 24: Hook Ending

Noel's apartment was too quiet.

He stood in the doorway for a moment, keys in hand, and stared at the space like it belonged to someone else.

The bed was made. He'd done that this morning, in a fit of optimistic denial. The coffee pot was clean. The kitchen was spotless.

Everything was exactly as he'd left it.

Except him. He was different. He'd left this morning hoping for clarity and come home with—

Between us.

Noel closed the door. Locked it. Set his keys on the counter with the kind of careful precision that meant he was holding himself together by sheer force of will.

He should eat. He hadn't eaten since—when? Lunch? Breakfast?

He wasn't hungry.

He should shower. Change. Do something productive.

He walked to the couch and sat down instead.

The scarf was still around his neck.

Noel stared at the ceiling and tried to make sense of the day.

Eben had said it wasn't a mistake. That was—something. That mattered.

Except then he'd said *this should stay between us*, and Noel's brain had immediately translated that to *you're not worth claiming.*

Which wasn't fair. Eben hadn't said that. Eben had said it was complicated. That he was leaving. That he didn't want to make things harder.

All of which were reasonable things to say.

None of which made Noel feel any less like he'd just been told he was good enough for sex but not good enough for—what? Acknowledgment? A relationship? The possibility of something more?

Noel closed his eyes.

This was the pattern, wasn't it? This was always the pattern. He made himself useful. He gave everything he had. And when it was over, people moved on, because Noel was the kind of person you kept around when you needed something, not the kind of person you kept.

Except Eben had looked terrified when he'd said *between us*. Not cold. Not dismissive. Terrified.

Like he was protecting himself from something.

Or protecting Noel.

Or both.

Noel opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling some more.

The problem was that he didn't know which it was. He didn't know if Eben was pulling away because he didn't want this, or because he wanted it too much and didn't know how to handle it.

And Noel didn't know how to ask without sounding desperate.

He wasn't going to push. That wasn't how Noel Merrick operated. He gave people space. He let them come to him. He made himself useful and hoped it was enough.

But he also wasn't going to pretend last night didn't happen.

That wasn't an option anymore.

His phone buzzed. Hugh. *You alive?*

Noel typed back. *Yeah. Home. Fine.*

*Liar. Want company?*

*No. Thanks though.*

*Okay. Call if you need me. Also you're keeping the scarf, right? Because that's a whole symbolic thing and I'm invested now.*

Noel looked down at the scarf. Soft. Charcoal gray. Smelling like Eben's cologne and cold air and the faint scent of pine from the festival.

He should give it back.

He wasn't going to give it back.

*Yeah,* he typed. *I'm keeping it.*

*Good. That's character growth. Proud of you.*

Noel set the phone down and let his head fall back against the couch.

Tomorrow was December 18. Day five of the festival. The sponsor was arriving. There would be meetings. Photos. Public appearances.

Eben wanted to keep this between them. Fine. Noel could do that. He could smile for the cameras and be professional and pretend that his chest didn't ache every time Eben looked at him like he was something dangerous.

He could do temporary. He could do secret. He could do anything except pretend last night didn't matter.

Because it did matter. It mattered to Noel in a way that was probably stupid and definitely inconvenient and absolutely, completely terrifying.

Eben had said *I want to.* He'd said *Look at me.* He'd touched Noel like he was something precious.

And then he'd left.

And then he'd said *between us* like it was a solution instead of a wound.

Noel pulled the scarf off and held it in his hands. The fabric was soft. Well-made. Expensive, probably. The kind of thing Eben would choose because it was practical and well-designed and would last.

The kind of thing Noel had stolen without asking and had no intention of returning.

He should feel guilty about that.

He didn't.

He wrapped the scarf around his neck again and closed his eyes.

If Eben wanted temporary, Noel could do temporary.

If Eben wanted secret, Noel could do secret.

But he wasn't giving back the scarf.

And he wasn't giving up.

Not yet.

Noel stared at the ceiling and thought: *If he wants temporary, I can do temporary. I can do anything except pretend last night didn't matter.*

Because it did.

And maybe—just maybe—Eben would figure that out too.
