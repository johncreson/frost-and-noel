## Chapter 23: The Boundary

The courtyard behind Merryweather Hall was quiet. Empty. Just Noel and Eben and the fairy lights strung between buildings, casting everything in soft gold.

Noel waited.

Eben stood a few feet away, hands in his pockets, jaw tight. He looked like he was bracing for impact.

"Last night wasn't a mistake," Eben said finally. His voice was low. Careful. "But this—us—it's complicated."

"Complicated how?"

"I'm leaving in two weeks. You know that."

"I know."

"And this festival is—there's a lot of pressure. A lot of eyes on us."

"I know that too."

Eben's jaw tightened. "I don't want to make this harder than it needs to be."

"Harder for who?"

"For both of us."

Noel stared at him. "Eben. What are you saying?"

Eben took a breath. Let it out. "This should stay between us. For the festival."

The words hit like a punch to the chest.

"Between us," Noel repeated.

"It's easier," Eben said.

Noel heard the lie. Saw it in the way Eben wouldn't quite meet his eyes. In the tension in his shoulders. In the careful, deliberate way he was holding himself like he might shatter if he moved wrong.

"Easier," Noel said flatly.

"Yes."

"For who?"

Eben didn't answer.

Noel's chest felt tight. His throat felt tight. Everything felt tight.

"So what," he said, voice carefully even. "We pretend last night didn't happen? We go back to being professional colleagues who happen to be running a festival together?"

"We don't have to pretend it didn't happen. We just—keep it private."

"Private." Noel laughed. It sounded bitter. "Right. Because god forbid anyone know that you—what? Slept with me? Wanted me?"

"That's not what I'm saying."

"Then what are you saying?"

Eben's hands clenched. "I'm saying I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to—" He stopped. Started again. "I don't do relationships. I don't do temporary. I don't—"

"I'm not asking you to marry me, Eben. I'm asking you to acknowledge that last night meant something."

"It did."

"Then why does this feel like you're trying to take it back?"

Eben flinched. "I'm not."

"You left. You didn't say anything. You've been acting like I don't exist all day. And now you want to keep this—whatever this is—a secret." Noel's voice cracked. "What am I supposed to think?"

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. And Noel saw it—the fear. The want. The absolute terror of admitting either.

"I'm trying to protect us," Eben said quietly.

"From what?"

"From this getting messy."

"It's already messy."

Eben didn't argue.

Noel took a breath. Let it out. His hands were shaking. He shoved them in his pockets.

"Okay," he said. "Okay. If that's what you want. We'll keep it between us."

Eben's face went carefully blank. "Okay."

"Is that all?"

"Yeah."

Noel nodded. Turned to leave.

"Noel."

He stopped. Didn't turn around.

"I'm sorry," Eben said.

Noel's throat was too tight to answer. He walked away.

Behind him, Eben stood in the courtyard, alone, surrounded by fairy lights that made everything look softer than it was.

Noel made it three blocks before he had to stop. Lean against a building. Breathe.

Between us.

The words echoed in his head.

Between us. Private. Secret. Temporary.

All the words that meant *you're not worth keeping.*

Except—

Except Eben had looked terrified when he'd said it. Not cold. Not dismissive. Terrified.

Like he was protecting himself from something.

Or protecting Noel.

Or both.

Noel pulled the scarf tighter around his neck and started walking again.

He didn't take it off.
