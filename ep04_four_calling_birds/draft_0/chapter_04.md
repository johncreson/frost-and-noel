## Chapter 20: The Crisis

The caroling started beautifully.

The crowd gathered in Evergreen Square, bundled against the cold, faces lit by fairy lights and the warm glow of the stage. The choir took their positions. The first notes of "Deck the Halls" rose into the night air, clear and bright.

Noel stood to the side, watching the crowd sing along. This was what he loved about Tinsel Town. The way people came together. The way music could make a cold December night feel warm.

He caught sight of Eben at the tech table, headphones around his neck, watching the stage with the focused intensity he brought to everything.

Their eyes met across the square.

Eben looked away first.

Noel turned back to the crowd and tried to focus on the music.

The choir moved into "Silent Night." The crowd swayed. Someone started handing out candles. It was perfect.

And then the sound system died.

Not gradually. Not with warning. Just—dead. The microphones cut out mid-verse. The speakers went silent. The choir kept singing, but their voices were swallowed by the open air and the murmur of the confused crowd.

Noel's stomach dropped.

He looked at Eben. Eben was already moving, headphones back on, hands flying over the equipment.

Mayor Kringle appeared at Noel's elbow, face pale. "What happened?"

"Technical issue. We're handling it." Noel's voice was calm. Professional. Completely at odds with the panic trying to claw its way up his throat.

"Can you fix it?"

"Yes." Noel had no idea if that was true. But he said it anyway, because that's what you did in a crisis.

The Mayor nodded and hurried off to reassure the crowd.

Noel turned to the stage. The choir had stopped singing, looking uncertain. The crowd was starting to murmur louder.

Right. Okay. Sound system down. Eben was handling the tech. Noel needed to handle the people.

He climbed onto the stage, smiled at the crowd, and raised his voice.

"Folks! We're having a small technical difficulty. But you know what? We don't need microphones to sing Christmas carols."

A few uncertain laughs.

"Come on. You all know the words to 'Jingle Bells,' right?"

More laughs. A few people called out agreement.

"Then let's hear it!"

Noel started singing. His voice wasn't trained, wasn't perfect, but it was loud and enthusiastic and completely shameless.

The crowd hesitated for maybe three seconds. Then they joined in.

Noel kept singing, kept smiling, kept the energy up. He moved through "Jingle Bells" into "Frosty the Snowman" into "Rudolph." The crowd followed. The choir joined in, voices blending with the audience.

It was chaotic. Unpolished. Absolutely not what they'd planned.

It was also kind of magical.

Noel risked a glance at the tech table. Eben had his coat off, sleeves rolled up, hands working on the equipment with the kind of focused precision that Noel had seen him bring to everything from spreadsheets to—

No. Not thinking about that.

Eben's scarf had fallen off the back of his chair.

Noel kept singing. Kept the crowd engaged. Kept one eye on Eben, because apparently his brain had decided that Eben-watching was a survival skill now.

Three songs later, Eben stood up. Gave a thumbs-up.

The sound system crackled back to life.

The crowd cheered.

Noel grinned, relief flooding through him. "And that's why we always have a backup plan! Let's hear it for our amazing tech team!"

More cheers. Eben didn't acknowledge them, just sat back down and started adjusting levels.

The choir took over, voices amplified now, filling the square with music.

Noel stepped off the stage and headed for the tech table, because he needed to know what had happened and also because he apparently had no self-control when it came to being near Eben.

Eben's scarf was still on the ground.

Noel picked it up without thinking. The fabric was soft. Cold from being outside. It smelled like—

He wrapped it around his own neck.

Eben looked up. Saw the scarf. His expression flickered—something Noel couldn't read—and then went carefully blank.

"What happened?" Noel asked.

"Loose connection. Fixed now."

"Good work."

"You too. The acoustic caroling was a good call."

It was the first real thing Eben had said to him all day. Noel's chest ached.

"We make a good team," Noel said quietly.

Eben's jaw tightened. "Yeah."

He turned back to the equipment.

Noel stood there for a moment, scarf around his neck, watching Eben pretend he didn't exist.

Then he walked away, because apparently that's what they were doing now.

The caroling continued. The crowd sang. The event was a success.

Noel realized he was still wearing Eben's scarf.

He didn't take it off.
