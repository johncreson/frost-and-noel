## Chapter 21: The Save

The event ended an hour later to thunderous applause.

The crowd dispersed slowly, still humming carols, faces bright with the kind of joy that only came from shared music and cold nights and too much hot cider. Volunteers started breaking down the setup. The choir packed up their folders.

Noel stood on the stage, watching the square empty, and felt—

He didn't know what he felt.

Relief that the event had gone well. Exhaustion from holding a smile for three hours straight. And underneath it all, a hollow ache that had nothing to do with the festival and everything to do with the man currently dismantling the sound system like it had personally wronged him.

"Noel!"

He turned. Hugh was waving from the cider station.

"Need help cleaning up?"

"Nope! We've got it. You and Frost did the heavy lifting. Go home. Rest. Stop looking like a sad puppy."

Noel's smile didn't waver. "I don't look like a sad puppy."

"You absolutely do. It's heartbreaking. Also, you're still wearing his scarf."

Noel's hand went to his neck. The scarf was still there. Soft. Warm. Smelling like—

"I'll give it back," Noel said.

"Sure you will." Hugh's expression softened. "Talk to him. Please. Before you both spontaneously combust from unresolved tension."

"There's nothing to talk about."

"Liar."

Hugh walked away before Noel could argue.

Noel stood there for a moment, alone on the stage, and made a decision.

He was going to talk to Eben. He was going to ask, directly, what last night meant. What this was. What they were doing.

And if Eben said it was nothing, that it was a mistake, that they should pretend it never happened—

Well. At least Noel would know.

He climbed down from the stage and headed for the tech table.

Eben was coiling cables with the kind of precision that suggested he was using it as a meditative practice. Or an avoidance tactic.

Probably both.

"Hey," Noel said.

Eben looked up. His eyes went to the scarf around Noel's neck. Something flickered across his face—too fast for Noel to read.

"Hey."

"Good work tonight."

"You too."

They stood there. The square was nearly empty now. Just a few volunteers in the distance, breaking down tables.

Noel took a breath. "We should talk."

Eben's hands stilled on the cable. "About what?"

"You know what."

Eben set the cable down. Carefully. Like it was made of glass.

"Noel—"

"Was last night a mistake?"

The question came out sharper than Noel intended. He watched Eben's face, looking for—something. Anything.

Eben's throat worked. "No."

Relief hit Noel so hard he almost staggered. "No?"

"No. It wasn't a mistake."

"Then what is this?" Noel gestured between them. "Because you've been acting like I don't exist all day, and I don't—I need to know what's happening."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. And for a second, Noel saw everything Eben was trying to hide. The want. The fear. The conflict.

Then Eben's expression shuttered.

"We should go somewhere private," Eben said quietly.

Noel's heart was pounding. "Okay."

They walked in silence to the back of Merryweather Hall, where the loading dock opened onto a small courtyard. Fairy lights strung between the buildings cast everything in soft gold. The air was cold enough to hurt.

Eben stopped. Turned to face him.

Noel waited.

The look they exchanged lasted too long. Said too much. Everything neither of them was willing to say out loud.

It said *last night meant something.* It said *I don't know how to be normal about this.* It said *please don't make me pretend it didn't happen.*

Noel's breath caught.

"Eben—"

"I don't know how to do this," Eben said quietly.

"Do what?"

"This. Us. Any of it."

Noel stepped closer. "You don't have to know. We can figure it out."

Eben's jaw tightened. "Can we?"

"Yes."

"I'm leaving in two weeks."

"I know."

"And this festival—there's a lot of pressure. A lot of eyes on us."

"I know that too."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. And Noel saw it—the fear. The want. The absolute terror of admitting either.

"I need to think," Eben said finally.

It wasn't what Noel wanted to hear. But it wasn't a rejection either.

"Okay," Noel said softly. "Okay."

Eben nodded. Turned to leave.

"Eben."

He stopped. Looked back.

"Last night mattered," Noel said. "To me. I need you to know that."

Something cracked in Eben's expression. "It mattered to me too."

Then he walked away.

Noel stood in the courtyard, alone, surrounded by fairy lights that made everything look softer than it was.

His chest ached.

But Eben had said it mattered.

That was something.

That was enough.

For now.
