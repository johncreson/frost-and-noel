## Chapter 22: The Talk

Noel made it three blocks before he had to stop. Lean against a building. Breathe.

*It mattered to me too.*

The words echoed in his head.

Eben had said it mattered. He'd also said he needed to think. Which meant—what? That he was considering this? That there was a possibility of something more?

Or that he was trying to figure out how to let Noel down gently?

Noel pushed off the building and kept walking.

His apartment was dark when he got home. Cold. He flipped on the lights and stood in the doorway, keys in hand, staring at the space like it belonged to someone else.

The bed was made. The coffee pot was clean. Everything was exactly as he'd left it this morning.

Except him. He was different.

He closed the door. Locked it. Set his keys on the counter.

The scarf was still around his neck.

Noel unwrapped it slowly. Held it in his hands. The fabric was soft. Well-made. The kind of thing Eben would choose because it was practical and well-designed and would last.

The kind of thing Noel had stolen without asking and had no intention of returning.

He should feel guilty about that.

He didn't.

His phone buzzed. Hugh. *You alive?*

*Yeah. Home. Fine.*

*Liar. Want company?*

*No. Thanks though.*

*Okay. Call if you need me. Also you're keeping the scarf, right? Because that's a whole symbolic thing and I'm invested now.*

Noel looked at the scarf in his hands.

*Yeah,* he typed. *I'm keeping it.*

*Good. That's character growth. Proud of you.*

Noel set the phone down and walked to the couch. Sat. Stared at the ceiling.

Eben had said it mattered.

He'd also said he needed to think.

Which meant Noel had to wait. Had to give him space. Had to trust that Eben would figure out what he wanted and come back with an answer.

Noel was good at waiting. He'd spent most of his life waiting for people to decide he was worth keeping.

The problem was that he didn't want to wait this time.

He wanted to march back to Merryweather Hall and demand answers. He wanted to grab Eben by the shoulders and say *what are we doing? Do you want this or not?*

But that wasn't how Noel operated. He gave people space. He let them come to him. He made himself useful and hoped it was enough.

Except—

Except Eben had looked terrified when he'd said he needed to think. Not cold. Not dismissive. Terrified.

Like he wanted this too much and didn't know how to handle it.

Noel closed his eyes.

Tomorrow was December 18. Day five of the festival. The sponsor was arriving. There would be meetings. Photos. Public appearances.

And Eben would either have an answer, or he wouldn't.

Either way, Noel would have to smile and be professional and pretend his chest didn't ache every time Eben looked at him like he was something dangerous.

He could do that. He was good at that.

He wrapped the scarf around his neck again and let his head fall back against the couch.

*It mattered to me too.*

That was something.

That was enough.

For now.
