## Previously in Frost & Noel...

Noel and Eben finally gave in to the tension that's been building since day one. Their first night together was tender, revealing, and complicated. But when Noel woke up the next morning, Eben was already gone.

Now Noel has to face the aftermath—and Eben has to face himself.

---

## Chapter 1: The Morning After

Noel woke up alone, which was fine. Normal. The sheets on the other side were cold. Also fine. He was going to be absolutely, aggressively fine about this.

He stared at the ceiling for a solid minute, cataloging the evidence. Empty bed. No note. No text. The apartment was quiet in that specific way that meant he was the only person in it, and had been for a while.

Fine.

He rolled out of bed and padded to the kitchen. The coffee he'd set up last night—optimistic, that—was still waiting. He pressed the button and watched it brew, because apparently his brain had decided that staring at things was today's primary activity.

The coffee finished. He poured a cup. Drank it black because he couldn't be bothered to open the fridge.

It was cold.

Not the coffee. Well, yes, the coffee. But also the apartment. The air. The whole situation.

He was not disappointed. That would require him to have had expectations, and expectations required hope, and hope required—nope. Not going there. Coffee first. Spiral later.

Except his brain had other plans.

*Eben left.*

That was the fact. Eben had left sometime in the night—or early morning, more likely, given the precision with which he did everything—without waking Noel. Without saying anything. Without leaving so much as a Post-it note that said "had to go, talk later."

Which was fine. They were adults. They'd had sex. Good sex. Great sex, if Noel was being honest, which he was trying very hard not to be right now. And then Eben had left, because that's what people did. That's what Noel had expected.

Except he hadn't expected it. Not really. Not after the way Eben had looked at him. Not after "Are you okay?" and "I don't know" and the careful, deliberate way Eben had touched him like he mattered.

Noel set the coffee down before he could throw it.

He was not doing this. He was not spiraling over a guy who'd been clear from the start that this was temporary. That the festival was temporary. That everything about this situation had an expiration date stamped on it in bold red letters.

He took a shower. Got dressed. Chose his clothes with the kind of care that he absolutely was not putting into looking good for someone who'd already seen him naked. The green sweater. The good jeans. The boots that made him feel like he had his life together.

He looked in the mirror. He looked fine.

He felt like shit.

His phone sat on the counter, screen blank. No messages. No missed calls. Nothing.

Noel picked it up, opened his messages, and stared at Eben's name for a full thirty seconds before closing the app without typing anything.

What was he supposed to say? *Hey, thanks for last night, also why did you leave, also are we okay, also what are we?*

No. Absolutely not. That was not how Noel Merrick operated. He didn't chase. He didn't demand answers. He made himself useful and waited for people to come to him, and if they didn't, well. That told him everything he needed to know.

He grabbed his coat and headed out.

---

Merryweather Hall looked the same as it always did. Warm lights. Evergreen garlands. The faint smell of cinnamon and pine that seemed to live in the walls. Noel pushed through the front doors and immediately got swept into the chaos.

"Noel! Thank god." Hugh appeared at his elbow, glitter already somehow in his hair despite it being nine in the morning. "The caroling stage setup is a disaster. The vendor sent the wrong risers and Eben's about to have an aneurysm."

"Where is he?"

"Loading dock. I'd give him space if I were you. He's in full Frost mode."

Noel's stomach dropped. "Got it."

He didn't give Eben space. He went straight to the loading dock, because apparently self-preservation was not on today's agenda.

Eben was there, clipboard in hand, staring at a stack of metal risers like they'd personally offended him. He looked—fine. Composed. Professional. The same as always.

He also didn't look up when Noel walked in.

"Morning," Noel said, keeping his voice light.

"Morning." Eben's tone was crisp. Efficient. Distant.

Noel waited for more. Eye contact. A smile. Anything.

Eben made a note on his clipboard.

"So," Noel tried again. "Riser situation?"

"Wrong size. I'm handling it."

"Need help?"

"I've got it."

The words were fine. Professional. Exactly what Eben would say on any normal day. But this wasn't a normal day, and the way Eben still wasn't looking at him made Noel's chest tighten in a way that had nothing to do with the cold air coming through the open dock door.

"Eben—"

"I need to call the vendor." Eben turned away, phone already to his ear. "Excuse me."

Noel stood there for a moment, frozen, as Eben walked to the far corner of the dock and started a conversation that very clearly did not include him.

There it was. The familiar sinking feeling. The one that said *you were only worth something when you were useful, and now that the usefulness of last night is over—*

No. He was not going to spiral. Not yet. Not until he knew for certain.

Except he did know. Eben's body language was a neon sign that said *I'm pretending last night didn't happen, and I need you to do the same.*

Noel took a breath. Let it out. Turned and walked back into the Hall.

Hugh was waiting, eyes too knowing. "You okay?"

"Fine," Noel said automatically.

"Liar."

"Yep."

Hugh handed him a clipboard. "Caroling prep. You're on crowd management. Try not to murder anyone."

"No promises."

Noel took the clipboard and got to work, because that's what he did. He was useful. He was competent. He was absolutely, aggressively fine.

Even if Eben Frost was currently acting like last night had never happened.

Even if Noel's chest felt like someone had reached in and squeezed.

Even if he wanted to grab Eben by the shoulders and demand to know what the hell this was, because "I want to" and "Look at me" didn't lead to cold professionalism the next morning. They didn't.

But Noel didn't do that. He smiled at the volunteers. He organized the setup. He made himself useful.

And he tried very, very hard not to think about the way Eben had looked at him last night, like Noel was something worth keeping.

Apparently, he'd been wrong.

---

## Chapter 2: The Distance

Eben Frost did not believe in regret. Regret was inefficient. It changed nothing and cost everything.

He was currently experiencing what could only be described as industrial-grade regret, and it was, in fact, changing nothing and costing everything.

He stared at his phone. The vendor was talking. Eben had no idea what they were saying. His entire consciousness was occupied by the fact that Noel had just walked away, and Eben had let him, and this was the right thing to do.

It didn't feel right.

It felt like he'd just taken something fragile and thrown it against a wall to see if it would break.

"Mr. Frost? Are you still there?"

"Yes," Eben said. "Send the correct risers by noon. Bill the error to your account."

He ended the call before they could argue.

The loading dock was empty now. Cold air poured through the open door. Eben should close it. He didn't move.

He'd left Noel's apartment at four in the morning because he couldn't handle waking up next to him. That was the truth. The simple, pathetic truth.

He'd woken up with Noel's head on his chest, one arm thrown across Eben's ribs, breathing slow and even. The apartment had been dark. Quiet. Warm.

Eben had felt—

No. He wasn't doing this.

He'd felt too much. That was the problem. He'd looked at Noel sleeping and thought *I could get used to this*, and that thought had sent him into a full-scale panic spiral that ended with him getting dressed in the dark and leaving like a coward.

Professional distance. That was the plan. Crisp. Efficient. Pretend last night was a one-time thing and move forward with the festival work.

Except Noel had looked at him with those warm eyes and asked if he needed help, and Eben had frozen like a malfunctioning robot and said *I've got it* in a tone that could freeze water.

He was doing a stellar job of pretending last night hadn't fundamentally rearranged his understanding of physical chemistry. Of emotional chemistry. Of chemistry generally.

Noel had looked hurt. Just for a second. Just a flash across his face before he'd smoothed it into something pleasant and professional.

Eben hated that he'd put that look there.

He also wasn't going to do anything about it, because this was the right call. The safe call. Noel didn't need to get tangled up in Eben's—whatever this was. Eben didn't need to get attached to someone he'd have to leave in two weeks.

The problem was that he was already tangled. Already attached. Already everything he'd promised himself he wouldn't be.

"Frost!"

Eben turned. Hugh was in the doorway, glitter catching the light like some kind of chaotic disco ball.

"What."

"Wow. Okay. Someone woke up on the wrong side of emotionally unavailable." Hugh crossed his arms. "Caroling prep. You're needed. Noel's handling the volunteers, but we need your tech brain for the sound system."

"I'll be there in five."

"You'll be there now. Also, whatever you did to Noel, fix it."

Eben's jaw tightened. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"Sure you don't. He's got that smile on. The one that means he's internally screaming. So either you two had a fight, or—" Hugh's eyes went wide. "Oh my god. You slept together."

"That's none of your business."

"You did! And now you're doing the thing where you panic and go all ice king. Eben. Buddy. That is the worst possible move."

"I'm not discussing this with you."

"You're not discussing it with anyone, which is the problem." Hugh stepped closer, voice dropping. "Look. I don't know what happened. But Noel's a good guy. He doesn't deserve to be frozen out."

Eben knew that. He knew that. It didn't change the fact that distance was safer. For both of them.

"I'm handling it," Eben said.

"Are you, though?"

No. He absolutely was not.

"Five minutes," Eben said, and walked past Hugh before he could say anything else.

---

The main hall was organized chaos. Volunteers everywhere. Boxes of decorations. The faint smell of pine and something baking from the kitchen. Eben scanned the room and found Noel immediately, because apparently his brain had decided that Noel-tracking was now a primary function.

Noel was at the far end, talking to a group of volunteers. Smiling. Gesturing. Looking completely at ease.

Except Eben knew that smile now. Knew the difference between Noel's real smile and the one he used when he was performing. This was performance.

Eben's chest tightened.

He forced himself to look away. Focused on the sound system setup. The equipment was standard. Easy. He could do this in his sleep.

He got to work.

Twenty minutes later, Noel appeared at his elbow.

"Hugh said you needed the stage layout for the speaker placement."

Eben didn't look up. "Yeah. Thanks."

Noel set the paper down. Didn't leave.

Eben kept his eyes on the equipment.

"Eben."

That voice. Quiet. Careful. The one that meant Noel was about to ask a question Eben didn't want to answer.

"I'm busy."

"I know. I just—" Noel stopped. Started again. "Are we okay?"

No. They were not okay. Eben had ruined this before it even started, and he didn't know how to fix it without making it worse.

"We're fine," Eben said.

The lie tasted like ash.

"Okay," Noel said softly. "Good."

He walked away.

Eben watched him go. Watched the careful set of his shoulders. The way he smiled at someone across the room like nothing was wrong.

Eben turned back to the sound system and tried to remember why distance was supposed to be the right choice.

He couldn't.

---

## Chapter 3: Caroling Prep

The afternoon was cold enough that Noel could see his breath, which felt appropriate given that everything else about today had been aggressively uncomfortable.

Evergreen Square was a hive of activity. Stage setup. Sound system. Volunteers hauling risers and stringing lights. The town's annual caroling night was in three hours, and Noel was determined to make it perfect.

Mostly because if he focused on work, he didn't have to think about the way Eben had looked right through him this morning.

The square was beautiful, at least. Someone had strung fairy lights between the lampposts, creating a canopy of warm gold that would look magical once the sun set. The stage was draped in evergreen garland. The air smelled like pine and cinnamon from the bakery across the street, where Wes was probably already prepping cookies for the post-caroling reception.

It was exactly the kind of cozy, picture-perfect scene that Tinsel Town did best.

Noel felt like he was going to throw up.

"Noel!" One of the volunteers waved him over. "Where do you want the cider station?"

"Near the stage, but not blocking sightlines. Maybe there?" He pointed to a spot that would work. "And make sure there's a clear path for people to refill. We don't want a bottleneck."

"Got it!"

Noel checked his clipboard. Cider station. Check. Risers. Check. Lights—still in progress. Sound system—

He looked across the square. Eben was at the tech table, headphones on, testing levels. Focused. Competent. Completely in his element.

Also still not looking at Noel.

Noel's chest tightened. They'd been in the same space for three hours now, and Eben had managed to avoid direct eye contact the entire time. It was impressive, really. The kind of precision avoidance that required active effort.

Which meant Eben was thinking about him.

Which meant—what? That he regretted last night? That he was embarrassed? That he wanted to pretend it never happened?

Noel didn't know. And he hated not knowing.

"You two are telepathic now. It's creepy."

Noel jumped. Hugh had appeared at his elbow, arms full of garland and somehow already covered in glitter despite the event not starting for hours.

"What?"

"You and Frost. You're working like a machine. It's unnatural." Hugh dumped the garland on a nearby table. "Also, you're both miserable. So that's fun."

"I'm not miserable."

"You're smiling. You're always smiling when you're miserable. It's your tell."

Noel's smile didn't waver. "I'm fine."

"Liar." Hugh leaned against the table, studying him. "What happened?"

"Nothing happened."

"Noel."

"Hugh."

They stared at each other. Hugh caved first, sighing dramatically.

"Fine. Don't tell me. But for the record, whatever's going on between you two is obvious to literally everyone except apparently you two."

Noel's stomach dropped. "There's nothing going on."

"Sure. And I don't have glitter in my hair." Hugh picked a piece of silver glitter off Noel's shoulder. "Mayor Kringle already asked me if you two were dating. I said no, but he didn't believe me."

"We're not dating."

"I know. You're just pining. Separately. While working together. It's very tragic and also very annoying."

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again.

"I'm not pining."

"You're wearing his scarf."

Noel's hand went to his neck. He was, in fact, wearing a scarf. A charcoal gray scarf that he'd grabbed from his apartment this morning because he'd forgotten his own.

Except it wasn't his. It was Eben's. He'd left it in Noel's apartment two days ago, and Noel had—

Oh god. He was wearing Eben's scarf.

In public.

Where everyone could see.

"I—this isn't—"

"It's fine. It looks good on you. Very 'I'm emotionally compromised but make it fashion.'" Hugh patted his shoulder. "Just maybe talk to him? Before the event? Because the tension is so thick I could cut it with a candy cane."

Hugh walked away before Noel could respond.

Noel stood there, hand still on the scarf, feeling like an idiot.

He should take it off. He should absolutely take it off.

He didn't take it off.

The scarf was soft. Warm. It smelled like Eben's cologne—something clean and understated that Noel had noticed the first time they'd worked together and had been trying very hard not to think about ever since.

He was failing spectacularly at not thinking about it.

Across the square, Eben adjusted a microphone stand. His movements were precise. Efficient. He'd taken off his coat, rolled up his sleeves despite the cold. Noel could see the line of his forearms, the careful way he handled the equipment.

Noel looked away before Eben could catch him staring.

This was fine. He was fine. They had a job to do, and Noel was going to do it, and he was not going to think about the way Eben's hands had felt on his skin or the way he'd said "Look at me" like it mattered or the way he'd left without saying goodbye.

He was absolutely not thinking about any of that.

---

An hour later, the square was ready. Lights strung. Stage set. Sound system tested. The crowd was starting to gather, bundled in coats and scarves, breath misting in the cold air.

Noel stood near the stage, checking his notes. Everything was in place. This was going to be fine.

"Noel! Eben!" Mayor Kringle appeared, beaming. "This looks wonderful! You two make quite the team."

"Thank you, Mayor," Noel said automatically.

Eben nodded from across the stage. Still not looking at Noel.

"Great chemistry!" The Mayor clapped Eben on the shoulder. "This will photograph beautifully. The town loves seeing you two work together."

Noel's smile felt like it was going to crack his face.

"We're happy to help," he said.

The Mayor wandered off, already greeting arriving townspeople. Noel risked a glance at Eben.

Eben was staring at his tablet like it held the secrets of the universe.

Noel looked away.

They worked in silence. Noel managed the volunteers. Eben handled the tech. They moved around each other like dancers who'd practiced this routine a hundred times.

It should have felt good. It felt awful.

Because they were good at this. They worked well together. They always had. And now there was this—thing—between them that neither of them was acknowledging, and Noel didn't know how to fix it.

He didn't know if Eben wanted to fix it.

A volunteer approached with a question about the choir risers. Noel answered. Checked his clipboard. Made a note.

Across the stage, Eben was doing the same thing. Answering questions. Solving problems. Being competent and professional and completely unavailable.

Noel wrapped the scarf tighter around his neck.

The sun was setting now, and the fairy lights were starting to glow. The square looked magical. The kind of scene that would photograph beautifully, just like the Mayor said.

Noel wondered if anyone would notice that he and Eben hadn't spoken directly to each other all afternoon.

Probably not. They were too good at this. Too practiced at working together without actually being together.

"Sound check in ten," Eben said, voice carrying across the stage.

"Got it," Noel called back.

Their eyes met for half a second. Eben looked away first.

Noel wrapped the scarf tighter around his neck and got back to work.

If the town thought they had chemistry, fine. Let them think that.

If only the town knew how spectacularly wrong it was going.

---

## Chapter 4: The Crisis

The caroling started beautifully.

The crowd gathered in Evergreen Square, bundled against the cold, faces lit by fairy lights and the warm glow of the stage. The choir took their positions. The first notes of "Deck the Halls" rose into the night air, clear and bright.

Noel stood to the side, watching the crowd sing along. This was what he loved about Tinsel Town. The way people came together. The way music could make a cold December night feel warm.

He caught sight of Eben at the tech table, headphones around his neck, watching the stage with the focused intensity he brought to everything.

Their eyes met across the square.

Eben looked away first.

Noel turned back to the crowd and tried to focus on the music.

The choir moved into "Silent Night." The crowd swayed. Someone started handing out candles. It was perfect.

And then the sound system died.

Not gradually. Not with warning. Just—dead. The microphones cut out mid-verse. The speakers went silent. The choir kept singing, but their voices were swallowed by the open air and the murmur of the confused crowd.

Noel's stomach dropped.

He looked at Eben. Eben was already moving, headphones back on, hands flying over the equipment.

Mayor Kringle appeared at Noel's elbow, face pale. "What happened?"

"Technical issue. We're handling it." Noel's voice was calm. Professional. Completely at odds with the panic trying to claw its way up his throat.

"Can you fix it?"

"Yes." Noel had no idea if that was true. But he said it anyway, because that's what you did in a crisis.

The Mayor nodded and hurried off to reassure the crowd.

Noel turned to the stage. The choir had stopped singing, looking uncertain. The crowd was starting to murmur louder.

Right. Okay. Sound system down. Eben was handling the tech. Noel needed to handle the people.

He climbed onto the stage, smiled at the crowd, and raised his voice.

"Folks! We're having a small technical difficulty. But you know what? We don't need microphones to sing Christmas carols."

A few uncertain laughs.

"Come on. You all know the words to 'Jingle Bells,' right?"

More laughs. A few people called out agreement.

"Then let's hear it!"

Noel started singing. His voice wasn't trained, wasn't perfect, but it was loud and enthusiastic and completely shameless.

The crowd hesitated for maybe three seconds. Then they joined in.

Noel kept singing, kept smiling, kept the energy up. He moved through "Jingle Bells" into "Frosty the Snowman" into "Rudolph." The crowd followed. The choir joined in, voices blending with the audience.

It was chaotic. Unpolished. Absolutely not what they'd planned.

It was also kind of magical.

Noel risked a glance at the tech table. Eben had his coat off, sleeves rolled up, hands working on the equipment with the kind of focused precision that Noel had seen him bring to everything from spreadsheets to—

No. Not thinking about that.

Noel kept singing. Kept the crowd engaged. Kept one eye on Eben, because apparently his brain had decided that Eben-watching was a survival skill now.

Three songs later, Eben stood up. Gave a thumbs-up.

The sound system crackled back to life.

The crowd cheered.

Noel grinned, relief flooding through him. "And that's why we always have a backup plan! Let's hear it for our amazing tech team!"

More cheers. Eben didn't acknowledge them, just sat back down and started adjusting levels.

The choir took over, voices amplified now, filling the square with music.

Noel stepped off the stage and headed for the tech table, because he needed to know what had happened and also because he apparently had no self-control when it came to being near Eben.

The scarf around his neck—Eben's scarf, the one he'd been wearing all day like an idiot—felt suddenly obvious.

Eben looked up. His eyes went straight to the scarf. Stayed there for a beat too long.

His expression flickered—recognition, something raw, something that looked almost like want—and then went carefully blank.

"What happened?" Noel asked.

"Loose connection. Fixed now."

"Good work."

"You too. The acoustic caroling was a good call."

It was the first real thing Eben had said to him all day. Noel's chest ached.

"We make a good team," Noel said quietly.

Eben's jaw tightened. "Yeah."

He turned back to the equipment.

Noel stood there for a moment, scarf around his neck, watching Eben pretend he didn't exist.

Then he walked away, because apparently that's what they were doing now.

The caroling continued. The crowd sang. The event was a success.

Noel realized he was still wearing Eben's scarf.

He didn't take it off.

---

## Chapter 5: The Save

The event ended an hour later to thunderous applause.

The crowd dispersed slowly, still humming carols, faces bright with the kind of joy that only came from shared music and cold nights and too much hot cider. Volunteers started breaking down the setup. The choir packed up their folders.

Noel stood on the stage, watching the square empty, and felt—

He didn't know what he felt.

Relief that the event had gone well. Exhaustion from holding a smile for three hours straight. And underneath it all, a hollow ache that had nothing to do with the festival and everything to do with the man currently dismantling the sound system like it had personally wronged him.

"Noel!"

He turned. Hugh was waving from the cider station.

"Need help cleaning up?"

"Nope! We've got it. You and Frost did the heavy lifting. Go home. Rest. Stop looking like a sad puppy."

Noel's smile didn't waver. "I don't look like a sad puppy."

"You absolutely do. It's heartbreaking. Also, you're still wearing his scarf."

Noel's hand went to his neck. The scarf was still there. Soft. Warm. Smelling like—

"I'll give it back," Noel said.

"Sure you will." Hugh's expression softened. "Talk to him. Please. Before you both spontaneously combust from unresolved tension."

"There's nothing to talk about."

"Liar."

Hugh walked away before Noel could argue.

Noel stood there for a moment, alone on the stage, and made a decision.

He was going to talk to Eben. He was going to ask, directly, what last night meant. What this was. What they were doing.

And if Eben said it was nothing, that it was a mistake, that they should pretend it never happened—

Well. At least Noel would know.

He climbed down from the stage and headed for the tech table.

Eben was coiling cables with the kind of precision that suggested he was using it as a meditative practice. Or an avoidance tactic.

Probably both.

"Hey," Noel said.

Eben looked up. His eyes went to the scarf around Noel's neck. Something flickered across his face—too fast for Noel to read.

"Hey."

"Good work tonight."

"You too."

They stood there. The square was nearly empty now. Just a few volunteers in the distance, breaking down tables.

Noel took a breath. "We should talk."

Eben's hands stilled on the cable. "About what?"

"You know what."

Eben set the cable down. Carefully. Like it was made of glass.

"Noel—"

"Was last night a mistake?"

The question came out sharper than Noel intended. He watched Eben's face, looking for—something. Anything.

Eben's throat worked. "No."

Relief hit Noel so hard he almost staggered. "No?"

"No. It wasn't a mistake."

"Then what is this?" Noel gestured between them. "Because you've been acting like I don't exist all day, and I don't—I need to know what's happening."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. And for a second, Noel saw everything Eben was trying to hide. The want. The fear. The conflict.

Then Eben's expression shuttered.

"We should go somewhere private," Eben said quietly.

Noel's heart was pounding. "Okay."

They walked in silence to the back of Merryweather Hall, where the loading dock opened onto a small courtyard. Fairy lights strung between the buildings cast everything in soft gold. The air was cold enough to hurt.

Eben stopped. Turned to face him.

Noel waited.

The look they exchanged lasted too long. Said too much. Everything neither of them was willing to say out loud.

Eben's jaw worked. "I need to think."

Then he walked away.

Noel stood in the courtyard, alone, surrounded by fairy lights that made everything look softer than it was.

It wasn't an answer.

It wasn't a rejection either.

But it wasn't enough.
