## BLURB

The whole town is talking.

Noel Merrick knew people would notice eventually. Tinsel Town is too small for secrets, and he's been walking a little too close to Eben Frost for a little too long.

But "talking" is one thing. "Opinions" are another.

The mayor is delighted. Hugh is insufferably smug. Wes looks like he's been waiting for this since day one. And Noel? Noel is trying very hard not to panic about the fact that whatever this is with Eben is now *public*.

Eben doesn't do public.

At least, that's what he told himself. But when a photographer catches them together—and Noel's face does that thing it does when he's expecting rejection—Eben makes a choice.

He reaches for Noel's hand.

In front of everyone.

**Day four of twelve. No more hiding.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring grumpy-sunshine dynamics, going public, small-town scrutiny, explicit heat, and a guaranteed HEA.*
