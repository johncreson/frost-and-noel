## Chapter 1: Morning After Rupture

**NOEL**

The bed was cold.

This was not news. Noel had been sleeping alone for years before Eben. He knew how to do this. He was very good at being alone.

He was handling it fine.

This was a lie, but it was a devastated lie, which was less festive than usual but still counted.

---

Noel stared at the ceiling and cataloged the situation.

One: He was awake. Technically. His eyes were open. That was close enough.

Two: It was morning. Probably. The light coming through the window suggested daylight, though it could also be the apocalypse. Hard to tell.

Three: Eben was gone.

Not gone as in *left the bed to make coffee*. Gone as in *never coming back because he'd said "this was never supposed to last" and Noel had said "okay" like a functioning person who definitely wasn't dying inside.*

So. Fine.

Everything was fine.

---

Shower. Hot enough to hurt.

Noel stood under the spray and tried to feel something. Anything. The water was scalding. His skin turned red. He registered this information the way someone might register the weather in a country they'd never visit.

Distantly.

Academically.

Not at all.

---

Clothes next.

The nice ones. The ones that said *I'm a professional adult human doing professional adult human things.*

Noel pulled on pants. Buttoned a shirt. Located socks that matched. This was called *functioning*. He was very good at it.

His hands only shook a little.

That was probably the cold.

December in Tinsel Town didn't mess around, and neither did Noel's central heating, which had the reliability of a coin flip and the temperament of a feral cat.

He left the ribbon on his wrist.

Didn't look at it.

Couldn't take it off.

The bright red silk sat against his skin like evidence. Like a scar. Like the only proof that any of it had been real.

---

Coffee.

Black. Because adding milk required decision-making, and Noel's brain had approximately three functional neurons left, all of which were currently occupied with the critical task of *not screaming.*

He sat at his kitchen table.

Drank the coffee.

Didn't taste it.

The apartment was quiet. Too quiet.

He'd always liked the quiet before. The space. The sense of having something that was his.

Now it just feltâ€”empty. Wrong. Like someone had scooped out the good parts and left the shell.

---

*This is fine,* Noel thought.

*I've done this before.*

He had. He'd performed fine-ness through breakups and disappointments and heartbreaks that felt world-ending at the time but turned out to be survivable.

This was just another one.

Except it wasn't.

Because this was Eben.

And Eben had beenâ€”

Eben had been everything.

For a moment.

For a brief, perfect, devastating moment.

Noel's chest did something complicated. Tight and sharp and wrong.

He took another sip of coffee.

Still didn't taste it.

---

His phone buzzed.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Morning! Big day today! Charity tree haul at Evergreen Square! See you at 9!*

Noel stared at the message.

Right.

The event.

The one he'd been coordinating for weeks. The one that involved vendors and volunteers and approximately ninety-seven moving parts, all of which required his attention.

The one that would also involve Eben.

Same space. Same town. Same man who'd destroyed him less than twenty-four hours ago.

His stomach dropped.

---

*Useful = worthy.*

That was the equation. The only equation that worked.

So he would be useful.

He would work. He would coordinate. He would smile and fix problems and make himself indispensable.

And he would not think about last night.

Would not think about Eben's face when he said *this was never supposed to last.*

Would not think about the way his own voice had sounded when he said *okay.*

Flat. Accepting. The sound of someone who'd expected this all along.

Because he had.

Hadn't he?

He'd known it was temporary. Eben had said so from the beginning. Noel had justâ€”

He'd just forgotten.

Forgotten that temporary meant *ending*. That borrowed time ran out. That people left.

They always left.

---

Noel stood.

Rinsed his mug. Put it in the dishwasher.

Grabbed his coat. His keys. His phone.

Checked his reflection in the hallway mirror.

The face staring back lookedâ€”normal. Functional. Fine.

The smile was practiced. Easy. The kind of smile that said *I'm okay, don't worry about me, I'm always okay.*

Nobody would see through it.

Nobody ever did.

That was the trick, wasn't it?

If you performed fine-ness well enough, people believed you.

They wanted to believe you.

Because if you were fine, they didn't have to worry. Didn't have to ask hard questions. Didn't have to see the parts of you that were breaking.

And Noel had been performing fine-ness his entire life.

He was very good at it.

---

He left the apartment.

Locked the door behind him.

Walked to his car through the cold December morning.

The sky was grey. Heavy. Storm clouds building on the horizon like the universe had decided to provide visual metaphors for his emotional state.

*Perfect,* Noel thought. *Even the weather's dramatic.*

He got in the car.

Started the engine.

Sat there for a moment, hands on the wheel, and thought: *I can do this.*

*I can get through one day.*

*I can smile and work and pretend.*

*I've done it before.*

*I can do it again.*

The lie settled in his chest like lead.

But he put the car in drive anyway.

---

The drive to Evergreen Square was short.

Too short.

Noel pulled into the parking area and saw the setup already underway.

Vendors. Volunteers. The usual organized chaos of a Tinsel Town event.

And thereâ€”

There, near the main staging areaâ€”

Eben.

Noel's heart stuttered.

Eben was talking to someone. Gesturing at a clipboard. Looking calm and collected and completely unaffected.

Like nothing had happened.

Like he hadn't destroyed Noel less than twenty-four hours ago.

Like this was just another day.

Noel's hands tightened on the steering wheel.

*This is fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*Mask on. Smile ready.*

*Nobody gets to see you break.*

He took a breath.

Got out of the car.

And walked toward the event.

Toward Eben.

Toward the performance of a lifetime.

---

The first person to notice him was Wes.

Of course it was Wes.

Wes had the uncanny ability to materialize exactly when you least wanted him to, bearing coffee and concern in equal measure.

"Morning," Wes said, appearing at his elbow with a to-go cup. Because of course he did. Wes always had coffee.

"Morning," Noel said.

His voice sounded normal.

Good.

"You okay?" Wes asked.

The question was gentle. Careful. The kind of careful that meant Wes already knew the answer.

"Yeah," Noel said. "Why?"

Wes gave him a look.

The look said: *I know you're lying but I'm not going to push.*

The look also said: *I'm here when you're ready.*

The look was kind, which made it worse.

"No reason," Wes said. "Coffee?"

"Thanks."

Noel took the cup. Sipped it.

Still didn't taste it.

His taste buds had apparently gone on strike along with the rest of his functional systems.

"Big day today," Wes said.

"Yeah."

"Storm's coming in later. Might have to move things indoors."

"We'll figure it out."

"Yeah." Wes paused. "You sure you're okay?"

"I'm fine."

The lie came easily.

It always did.

Wes studied him for a moment longer. Then nodded. "Okay. Let me know if you need anything."

"Will do."

Wes walked away.

And Noel stood there, holding his coffee, staring at the event setup.

At Eben.

Who still hadn't looked at him.

---

*This is fine,* Noel thought.

*This is normal.*

*I've done this before.*

And he had.

He'd performed fine-ness through breakups and disappointments and heartbreaks before.

This was justâ€”

This was just another one.

Except it wasn't.

Because this was Eben.

And Eben had beenâ€”

Eben had been everything.

For a moment.

For a brief, perfect, devastating moment.

And now he was gone.

And Noel was alone.

Again.

The way he'd always been.

The way he'd always known he would be.

---

Noel took a breath.

Put on his smile.

And walked toward the staging area.

Toward the work.

Toward the performance.

Nobody was going to see him break.

Not today.

Not ever.

He was fine.

He was always fine.

Even when he wasn't.

Especially when he wasn't.
## Chapter 2: Same Space, Different World

**NOEL**

They saw each other at the same time.

Noel was crossing the square, coffee in hand, smile fixed in place like armor.

Eben was near the staging area, clipboard in hand, looking like he'd slept fine and felt fine and was generally having a fine morning.

Their eyes met.

And for a momentâ€”just a momentâ€”everything stopped.

---

The world narrowed to a single point.

Eben.

Standing twenty feet away. Looking at him with an expression Noel couldn't read.

Noel's heart stuttered. His breath caught. His entire body went very still.

*Say something,* he thought. *Do something.*

But he didn't know what to say.

Didn't know what to do.

Didn't know how to be in the same space as Eben withoutâ€”

Without everything.

So he did what he always did when he didn't know what else to do.

He smiled.

Nodded.

And kept walking.

---

Eben nodded back.

That was it.

No words. No acknowledgment. Just a professional nod between two people who were definitely not dying inside.

Noel made it three more steps before his hands started shaking.

He gripped his coffee tighter.

*This is fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*Just get through today.*

*One day. You can do one day.*

The lie tasted like ash, but he swallowed it anyway.

---

The event setup continued around them.

Volunteers hauling equipment. Vendors setting up booths. The usual organized chaos of a Tinsel Town event.

Noel threw himself into it.

Coordinating. Organizing. Fixing problems before they became disasters.

Moving constantly. Smiling constantly. Being useful constantly.

Because useful people didn't break down.

Useful people showed up. Did their jobs. Smiled through the pain.

And Noel was nothing if not useful.

---

They didn't talk.

Not directly.

They communicated through other people.

"Can you tell Eben we need more tables on the east side?"

"Let Noel know the sound system is set up."

"Ask Eben if the donation bins are ready."

"Tell Noel the schedule's been updated."

Working in the same space had never felt so far apart.

---

Noel could feel Eben watching him.

Could track his position without looking.

Could sense exactly where he was at any given moment.

It was torture.

Because his body remembered.

Remembered what it felt like to be close to Eben. To touch him. To be touched by him.

Remembered the weight of Eben's hand on his back. The warmth of his presence. The way he'd looked at Noel like he was something precious.

And nowâ€”

Now there was just distance.

Cold. Deliberate. Unbridgeable.

Noel kept moving. Kept smiling. Kept working.

And tried not to think about how much it hurt.

---

"You okay?"

Wes appeared at his elbow again.

Noel was starting to suspect Wes had some kind of distress-sensing radar. Or possibly just very good timing and a concerning level of observation skills.

"Yeah," Noel said automatically. "Just busy."

"You and Ebenâ€”"

"We're fine."

"Noelâ€”"

"We're fine, Wes. Justâ€”busy. With the event."

Wes studied him for a long moment.

Noel kept his smile in place.

It was a good smile. One of his best. The smile that said *nothing to see here, move along, I'm totally fine and definitely not falling apart.*

"What happened?" Wes asked quietly.

"Nothing."

"That's notâ€”"

"Nothing happened. We're fine. Everything's fine."

The lie tasted like ash.

Wes didn't believe him. Noel could see it in his eyes.

But Wes didn't push.

Just squeezed his shoulder. "If you need anythingâ€”"

"I know. Thanks."

Wes walked away.

And Noel stood there, holding his clipboard, trying to remember how to breathe.

---

The morning passed in a blur of coordinated avoidance.

They orbited each other.

Never touching. Never speaking directly.

But alwaysâ€”alwaysâ€”aware of exactly where the other was.

It was exhausting.

---

At one point, they ended up on opposite sides of the same table.

Noel was adjusting a display. Eben was checking inventory.

Three feet apart.

Might as well have been miles.

Neither spoke.

Neither looked up.

But the air between them felt electric. Charged. Impossible to ignore.

Noel's hands shook slightly as he straightened a sign.

He could smell Eben's cologne.

Could hear his breathing.

Could feel the space between them like a physical thing.

Someone called Noel's name.

He left.

Walked away without looking back.

Because if he looked back, he mightâ€”

He might what?

Ask Eben to take it back? To say he didn't mean it? To choose them?

Noel had never been good at asking for things he couldn't have.

---

The town was watching.

Noel could feel it.

The whispers. The glances. The knowing looks.

Everyone had seen the photos. Had seen them together. Had assumedâ€”

Had assumed they were together.

And nowâ€”

Now they were very clearly not together.

And everyone noticed.

Mrs. Chen from the bookshop gave him a sympathetic look.

The Hendersons whispered to each other when he passed.

Even Mayor Kringle looked concerned.

"Everything alright, Noel?" he asked, hovering anxiously.

"Fine," Noel said. Smiled. "Just focused on the event."

"You and Ebenâ€”"

"Are working very well together. As always."

The lie was getting easier.

That was the problem.

The lie was always easier than the truth.

---

The sky was darkening.

Storm clouds rolling in from the north. Heavy. Ominous.

The temperature dropped.

Wind picked up.

Someone called out: "Storm's coming in fast!"

Mayor Kringle looked panicked. "We need to move everything indoors!"

"Where?" someone asked.

Everyone looked around.

The community center was booked. The church was too small. The school was closed for the holidays.

Noel heard Eben's voice: "Frost Line Logistics."

Everyone turned to look at him.

"My warehouse," Eben said. "It's big enough. We can move everything there."

Mayor Kringle looked relieved. "Are you sure?"

"Yeah. It's fine."

Noel's stomach dropped.

Frost Line Logistics.

Eben's warehouse.

Noel had never been there.

Had never seen Eben's space. His work. The place he'd built.

And nowâ€”

Now he was going to spend the afternoon there.

Trapped.

With Eben.

During a storm.

The universe had a terrible sense of humor.

---

They moved the event.

Quickly. Efficiently.

Volunteers hauling equipment. Vendors packing up. Everyone following Eben's truck to the warehouse on the edge of town.

Noel drove in silence.

Hands tight on the wheel.

Trying not to think about what this meant.

Trying not to hope.

Because hope was dangerous.

Hope had teeth.

And Noel had learnedâ€”painfully, devastatinglyâ€”not to hope for things he couldn't have.

---

The warehouse loomed ahead.

Large. Industrial. Impersonal.

Exactly what Noel would have expected from Eben.

Also, apparently, the perfect setting for an emotional reckoning.

Because the universe had a flair for dramatic irony and zero chill.

They pulled into the parking lot.

The first drops of rain started to fall.

And Noel sat in his car, staring at the building, and thought: *I can do this.*

*I can get through one afternoon.*

*I can be in the same space as Eben without falling apart.*

The lie felt thin.

Fragile.

But it was all he had.

So he got out of the car.

And walked toward the warehouse.

Toward Eben's space.

Toward whatever came next.
## Chapter 3: The Storm Arrives

**EBEN**

Frost Line Logistics was not designed for emotional confrontations.

It was designed for pallets and shipping manifests and the kind of organized efficiency that made Eben's brain happy.

Clean lines. Clear systems. Everything in its place.

No mess. No chaos. No feelings.

And yet.

---

The warehouse was massive.

High ceilings. Industrial lighting. Rows of shelving stretching toward the back.

It smelled like cardboard and metal and cold air.

Impersonal. Functional. Empty.

Exactly like Eben.

Or at leastâ€”exactly like Eben pretended to be.

---

People flooded in as the rain started in earnest.

Volunteers. Vendors. Equipment. Donations.

The organized chaos of the charity event transplanted into Eben's carefully controlled space.

He directed traffic. Pointed people toward open areas. Helped unload.

And tried very hard not to watch Noel.

Failed.

Because Noel was here.

In his space.

The place Eben had built specifically to keep the world out.

And now the world was here.

And Noel was here.

And Eben didn't know how to handle it.

---

Noel stood near the entrance, looking around.

Taking in the space. The organization. The complete lack of personal touches.

No photos. No decorations. No evidence that a human being actually worked here.

Justâ€”systems. Efficiency. Control.

Eben watched him look and thought: *This is who I am.*

*This is what I built.*

*Empty. Organized. Alone.*

And for the first time, it feltâ€”

Wrong.

---

The event setup continued.

Tables arranged. Donation bins organized. The charity tree haul transformed into an indoor operation.

Mayor Kringle was relieved. The vendors were adaptable. The volunteers were cheerful.

Everyone seemed fine with the change.

Except Eben.

Who stood in the middle of his warehouse, surrounded by people, and felt more alone than he had in years.

---

"Eben."

Sam's voice. Quiet. Deliberate.

Eben turned.

Sam was standing near the back shelving, arms crossed, expression unreadable.

"Can I talk to you for a minute?"

It wasn't really a question.

"Yeah," Eben said. "Sure."

They walked toward the back of the warehouse. Away from the crowd. Into the quiet space between the shelves.

Sam didn't waste time.

"You're doing that thing you do," he said.

Eben's stomach dropped. "What thing."

"The thing where you ruin everything before it can ruin you."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Had no idea what to say.

Sam waited.

Patient. Implacable. The way he always was when he'd decided to say something that needed saying.

"I don'tâ€”" Eben started.

"Yes, you do." Sam's voice was calm. Matter-of-fact. "I've known you for five years, Eben. I've watched you do this with jobs. With friendships. With anything that gets too close."

"That's notâ€”"

"It is." Sam's eyes were steady. Unflinching. "You find something good. Something that matters. And the second it starts to feel realâ€”the second you start to need itâ€”you destroy it."

Eben's throat closed.

Because Sam was right.

Sam was always right.

That was the problem with Sam. He saw things. Understood things. And he didn't let you hide from them.

"I didn't mean toâ€”" Eben said quietly.

"I know you didn't mean to." Sam's voice softened slightly. "That's the worst part. You don't even realize you're doing it. It's justâ€”automatic. Self-protection. The pattern you learned a long time ago."

"I was scared," Eben admitted.

"I know."

"I didn't know what to do."

"So you ran."

"Yes."

"While standing still."

Eben looked away. "Yes."

---

Sam was quiet for a moment.

Then: "Wes told me you were good for Noel."

Eben's head snapped up.

"He said Noel was different with you," Sam continued. "Lighter. Happier. Like he'd finally found someone who saw him. Really saw him. Not just what he could do for them."

Eben's chest tightened.

"I believed him," Sam said. "I thoughtâ€”finally. Someone who gets it. Someone who understands that Noel's worth more than just being useful."

He paused.

"Was he wrong?"

The question hung in the air.

Simple. Devastating.

*Was he wrong?*

Had Eben ever been good for Noel?

Or had he just been another person who took what Noel offered and then left when it got too hard?

---

"I don't know," Eben said quietly.

"That's not good enough."

"I know."

"You hurt him."

"I know."

"He's out there right now, pretending he's fine. Smiling at everyone. Being useful. Making sure nobody worries about him." Sam's voice was hard. "And he's breaking. Can you see that? He's breaking, and he's doing it alone, because you made him think he wasn't enough."

The words hit like a gut punch.

"I didn't meanâ€”"

"It doesn't matter what you meant. It matters what you said. And what you said was: 'This was never supposed to last.'"

Eben flinched.

"Did you mean it?" Sam asked.

"No."

"Then why did you say it?"

"Because I was terrified." The admission came out raw. Honest. "Because it was real. Because I needed him. Because Iâ€”" His voice broke. "Because I didn't know how to be that vulnerable."

"So you destroyed it."

"Yes."

"Before it could destroy you."

"Yes."

Sam nodded slowly. "That's what I thought."

---

They stood there in silence.

The warehouse hummed around them. Voices. Movement. The sound of the storm outside.

But hereâ€”in this quiet space between the shelvesâ€”it was just them.

Just Sam, looking at Eben with something that might have been disappointment.

And Eben, realizing exactly what he'd done.

"I have to fix this," Eben said quietly.

"Yes. You do."

"I don't know how."

"You'll figure it out." Sam's voice was firm. "Because the alternative is losing him. And I don't think you can live with that."

Eben looked toward the front of the warehouse.

Toward where Noel was. Somewhere in the crowd. Smiling. Working. Pretending.

"No," Eben said quietly. "I can't."

---

Sam studied him for a long moment.

Then: "Good. Because Noel deserves someone who fights for him. Someone who chooses him. Even when it's scary. Even when it's hard."

"I know."

"Do you?" Sam's eyes were sharp. "Because from where I'm standing, you chose fear. You chose your walls. You chose to run."

"I know."

"So the question isâ€”" Sam's voice was quiet. Deliberate. "What are you going to choose now?"

---

Eben didn't have an answer.

Not yet.

But he knewâ€”absolutely knewâ€”that he couldn't keep choosing fear.

Couldn't keep choosing his walls.

Couldn't keep running from the one thing that actually mattered.

"I'm going to fix this," he said again.

Sam nodded. "When?"

"Tomorrow. Christmas Eve."

"Why not now?"

"Becauseâ€”" Eben gestured toward the warehouse. The crowd. The event. "Because he's not ready. He told meâ€”he said 'not today.'"

Sam's expression shifted. Something softer. "He said that?"

"Yes. When I tried to talk to him earlier. He said 'not today. Please.'" Eben's throat tightened. "His voice cracked on 'please.'"

"Jesus," Sam said quietly.

"I know."

"You really did a number on him."

"I know."

Sam sighed. "Okay. Tomorrow. Christmas Eve. You apologize. You explain. You tell him the truth."

"What if he doesn't believe me?"

"Then you keep trying. You keep showing up. You keep choosing him. Until he does."

"And if he doesn't want me back?"

Sam looked at him steadily. "Then you live with it. Because that's the consequence of what you did. And you don't get to run from consequences."

Eben nodded slowly.

Sam was right.

He was always right.

That was the problem.

---

They walked back toward the front of the warehouse.

The event was in full swing. People browsing donation items. Volunteers organizing. The charity tree haul happening despite the storm.

Eben scanned the crowd.

Found Noel.

He was near the far wall, talking to a vendor. Smiling. Gesturing. Looking perfectly fine.

Exceptâ€”

Except Eben knew that smile.

Knew what it meant.

Knew that underneath it, Noel was breaking.

And it was Eben's fault.

---

As if sensing his gaze, Noel looked up.

Their eyes met across the warehouse.

For a moment, everything stopped.

Noel's smile faltered. Just slightly. Just enough for Eben to see the hurt underneath.

Then someone called Noel's name.

He turned away.

And Eben stood there, in the middle of his empty warehouse, surrounded by people, and thought: *I did this.*

*I broke him.*

*And I have to fix it.*

---

Sam's words echoed in his head.

*You're destroying something before it can hurt you.*

*What are you going to choose now?*

Eben looked around the warehouse.

At the space he'd built. The systems he'd created. The walls he'd constructed.

All of it designed to keep people out.

To keep himself safe.

To keep from needing anyone.

And it had worked.

For years, it had worked.

He'd been safe. Protected. Invulnerable.

And completely, utterly alone.

Until Noel.

---

Noel, who'd slipped past every defense Eben had.

Who'd made him laugh. Made him care. Made him want to stay.

Who'd looked at all of Eben's sharp edges and careful distance and said: *I see you. And I'm not going anywhere.*

Who'd trusted Eben with his wounds. His fears. His carefully hidden vulnerabilities.

Who'd said *I love you* first.

And Eben had destroyed it.

Had taken that trust and broken it.

Had said the worst possible thing and watched Noel's face go blank.

Had chosen fear over love.

Walls over connection.

Safety over everything that mattered.

---

The storm raged outside.

Rain pounding against the roof. Wind howling. Thunder in the distance.

Inside, the warehouse was warm. Bright. Full of people.

But Eben felt cold.

Empty.

Alone.

Even with Noel twenty feet away.

Especially with Noel twenty feet away.

Because the distance between them wasn't physical.

It was the distance Eben had created.

The wall he'd built.

The choice he'd made.

And he didn't know how to tear it down.

---

But he had to try.

Tomorrow.

Christmas Eve.

He'd apologize. Explain. Tell Noel the truth.

*I was scared. I didn't mean it. I love you. I'm choosing you.*

*Please give me another chance.*

And if Noel said noâ€”

If Noel couldn't forgive himâ€”

Then Eben would live with it.

Would accept the consequence of what he'd done.

Would spend the rest of his life knowing he'd destroyed the best thing that ever happened to him.

Because he'd been too scared to keep it.

---

The storm continued.

The event continued.

And Eben stood in his warehouse, watching Noel across the room, and thought: *Tomorrow.*

*I'll fix this tomorrow.*

*I have to.*

Because the alternativeâ€”

The alternative was unacceptable.
## Chapter 4: The Yearning

**NOEL**

Noel had never been to Frost Line Logistics before.

Had never seen Eben's space. His work. The place he'd built.

And now he was here.

Standing in the middle of it.

Surrounded by Eben's careful organization. His systems. His control.

It feltâ€”

Wrong.

And right.

And devastating.

---

The warehouse was exactly what Noel would have expected.

Clean. Organized. Efficient.

Everything labeled. Everything in its place. Everything controlled.

No personal touches. No photos. No evidence that a human being actually worked here.

Justâ€”systems.

Like Eben had built a space that perfectly reflected who he pretended to be.

Cold. Distant. Untouchable.

Except Noel knew better.

Knew that underneath all that control was someone who felt everything.

Who was terrified of feeling everything.

Who'd rather destroy something beautiful than risk being hurt by it.

---

The event had settled into the space.

Tables set up. Donation bins organized. People browsing. Volunteers helping.

The charity tree haul, transplanted indoors.

It was working.

Everyone seemed fine with it.

Except Noel.

Who stood near the far wall, holding a clipboard he wasn't reading, and tried not to think about where he was.

Tried not to think about what it meant.

Tried not to think about Eben.

Failed.

---

*Don't miss him.*

*Don't miss him.*

*He made his choice.*

The mantra repeated in Noel's head like a prayer.

Like if he said it enough times, it might become true.

But it didn't work.

Because Eben was across the room.

And Noel's whole body knew exactly where he was.

Could track his position without looking.

Could sense his presence like a magnetic pull.

That was the cruelest part.

He couldn't stop feeling him.

Couldn't turn off the awareness.

Couldn't make his body forget what it had learned.

What it felt like to be close to Eben. To touch him. To be touched by him.

To feel safe. Wanted. Seen.

---

Someone called his name.

Noel turned. Smiled. Answered a question about donation sorting.

Went back to his clipboard.

His hands were shaking slightly.

He pressed them flat against the paper.

*Get it together,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*You've done this before.*

*You can get through one afternoon.*

The lie tasted familiar.

Comfortable, even.

Like an old friend he'd known his entire life.

---

The warehouse was cold.

Industrial. Impersonal.

So empty.

Noel looked around at the shelving. The organization. The complete lack of anything personal.

And thought: *This is where Eben feels safe.*

*This is what he built when he decided not to need anyone.*

*This is what I was competing with.*

The realization settled in his chest like lead.

Because how could Noel compete with this?

With walls this high. Systems this perfect. Control this complete.

He couldn't.

He'd never stood a chance.

---

The storm raged outside.

Rain pounding against the roof. Wind howling. Thunder rolling in the distance.

Inside, the warehouse was warm. Bright. Full of people.

But Noel felt cold.

Alone.

Even surrounded by the town. Even in the middle of the event.

Especially here.

In Eben's space.

Where everything was organized and nothing was personal and Noel could seeâ€”so clearlyâ€”exactly what Eben had chosen.

This.

Empty efficiency.

Safe distance.

Walls.

Instead of Noel.

---

He moved through the afternoon on autopilot.

Helping vendors. Organizing donations. Answering questions.

Smiling. Always smiling.

The performance of fine-ness.

He was very good at it.

Had been practicing his entire life.

---

At one point, he ended up near the coffee station.

Someone had set up a makeshift break area. Thermoses. Cups. Cookies from the Candle & Crumb.

Noel poured himself coffee he didn't want.

Stood there, holding the cup, staring at nothing.

"You okay?"

Hugh. Appearing beside him with his usual quiet concern.

"Yeah," Noel said automatically. "Justâ€”taking a break."

"You sure?"

"I'm fine."

Hugh studied him for a moment. "You don't look fine."

"I'm fine."

"Noelâ€”"

"I'm fine, Hugh. Really. Justâ€”tired."

The lie came easily.

It always did.

Hugh didn't believe him. Noel could see it in his eyes.

But Hugh didn't push.

Just squeezed his shoulder. "If you need anythingâ€”"

"I know. Thanks."

Hugh walked away.

And Noel stood there, holding his coffee, and thought: *I'm not fine.*

*I'm breaking.*

*And nobody can see it.*

*Nobody ever sees it.*

---

He looked across the warehouse.

Found Eben without meaning to.

Eben was near the main staging area, talking to Mayor Kringle. Gesturing at something. Looking calm and collected and completely in control.

Like he belonged here.

In this empty, organized space.

Like this was where he was meant to be.

And maybe it was.

Maybe Noel had been the anomaly. The disruption. The thing that didn't fit into Eben's carefully controlled world.

Maybe "temporary" had always been the only option.

---

As if sensing his gaze, Eben looked up.

Their eyes met across the warehouse.

Everything stopped.

Noel's breath caught. His heart stuttered. His entire body went very still.

Eben's expression shifted. Something raw flickering in his eyes.

Want. Regret. Pain.

For a momentâ€”just a momentâ€”Noel saw it.

Saw past the control. Past the walls. Past the careful distance.

Saw Eben.

The real Eben.

The one who felt everything and was terrified of it.

The one who'd said *I love you* and meant it.

The one who'd destroyed them because he was too scared to keep them.

---

Noel wanted to look away.

Couldn't.

Wanted to move.

Couldn't.

Wanted to stop feeling this.

Couldn't.

The distance between them felt infinite.

Unbridgeable.

A chasm Noel didn't know how to cross.

Didn't know if he should cross.

Didn't know if Eben wanted him to cross.

---

Someone called Noel's name.

The moment broke.

Noel turned away.

Forced himself to focus on the vendor who needed help.

Forced himself to smile.

Forced himself to breathe.

But his hands were shaking.

And his chest felt too tight.

And he couldn't stop thinking about the way Eben had looked at him.

Like he was drowning.

Like he wanted to reach out.

Like he didn't know how.

---

*Don't hope,* Noel told himself. *Don't you dare hope.*

Because hope was dangerous.

Hope had teeth.

Hope would destroy him faster than anything else.

He'd learned that lesson. Painfully. Devastatingly.

He wouldn't make that mistake again.

---

The afternoon dragged on.

The event continued. People browsed. Donations were sorted. The charity tree haul was a success despite the storm.

Everyone seemed happy.

Except Noel.

Who moved through the warehouse like a ghost.

Present but not present.

Smiling but not smiling.

Fine but not fine.

---

He found himself near the back shelving at one point.

Away from the crowd. Away from the noise.

Justâ€”standing there.

In the quiet space between the rows.

Surrounded by Eben's organization. His systems. His control.

And Noel thought: *This is what he chose.*

*This empty, organized space.*

*This is what he wanted more than me.*

The thought hurt.

More than it should.

More than Noel wanted to admit.

Because he'd knownâ€”hadn't he?â€”that this was how it would end.

He'd known from the beginning that he wasn't enough.

That "useful" was all he'd ever be.

That temporary was the only thing he'd ever get.

He'd justâ€”

He'd just forgotten.

For a moment.

For a brief, perfect, devastating moment.

He'd let himself believe.

---

"Noel."

Eben's voice.

Quiet. Careful.

Noel's entire body went rigid.

He turned.

Eben was standing a few feet away. Hands in his pockets. Expression unreadable.

They were alone.

Hidden by the shelving. Away from the crowd.

Just them.

In Eben's space.

In the quiet.

---

Noel's heart was pounding so hard it hurt.

"Eben," he said. His voice sounded normal. Good.

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Seemed to be struggling with something.

"Iâ€”" he started.

Noel's chest tightened.

*Don't,* he thought. *Please don't.*

*I can't do this.*

*Not today.*

*Not here.*

"Don't," Noel said quietly.

Eben stopped.

"I need toâ€”" Eben tried again.

"Not today." Noel's voice cracked. "Please."

The word came out broken.

Raw.

Honest in a way Noel hadn't meant it to be.

---

Eben went very still.

Something shifted in his expression. Pain. Understanding. Regret.

"Okay," he said quietly.

He didn't move.

Didn't leave.

Just stood there, looking at Noel like he was something precious and broken and Eben didn't know how to fix it.

Noel couldn't handle it.

Couldn't handle the way Eben was looking at him.

Couldn't handle being this close.

Couldn't handle the way his body wanted to reach out.

Wanted to close the distance.

Wanted to believe that maybeâ€”

No.

No.

He couldn't do this.

---

"I have to go," Noel said.

He walked away.

Didn't look back.

Didn't let himself look back.

Because if he looked backâ€”

If he saw Eben's faceâ€”

He might break.

And he couldn't break.

Not here.

Not in front of everyone.

Not when he'd worked so hard to hold it together.

---

Noel made it to the front of the warehouse.

Found a quiet corner.

Pressed his back against the wall.

And tried to breathe.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*Just get through the rest of the day.*

*Just get through this.*

But his hands were shaking.

And his chest was too tight.

And he could still feel Eben's presence.

Could still see the way he'd looked at Noel.

Like he wanted to say something.

Like he wanted to fix this.

Like he didn't know how.

---

*Don't hope,* Noel thought again. *Don't you dare hope.*

Because hope would destroy him.

Hope would make him believe that maybe Eben regretted it.

Maybe Eben wanted him back.

Maybe "this was never supposed to last" wasn't the truth.

And Noel couldn't afford to believe that.

Couldn't afford to hope.

Couldn't afford to be wrong again.

---

The storm continued outside.

The event continued inside.

And Noel stood in the corner of Eben's warehouse, surrounded by people, and felt more alone than he'd ever felt in his life.

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a lie.

A reminder of everything he'd lost.

Everything he'd never really had.

Noel stared at it and thought: *I should take it off.*

*I should let go.*

*I should accept that it's over.*

But he couldn't.

Not yet.

Not when it was the only proof that any of it had been real.

Even if only for a moment.

Even if only temporarily.

Even if it had all been a mistake.

---

Someone called his name.

Noel took a breath.

Put on his smile.

And went back to work.

Back to being useful.

Back to pretending he was fine.

Because that's what he did.

That's what he'd always done.

And he was very, very good at it.
## Chapter 5: The Storm Clears

**EBEN**

The storm passed as quickly as it had arrived.

One moment, rain pounding against the roof. Thunder rolling. Wind howling.

The nextâ€”

Silence.

The kind of heavy, expectant silence that came after chaos.

---

People started gathering their things.

The event was winding down. Donations sorted. Trees distributed. The charity haul a success.

Mayor Kringle was beaming. The vendors were satisfied. The volunteers were cheerful.

Everyone seemed pleased with how it had turned out.

Everyone except the two people who'd made it happen.

---

Eben stood near the loading dock, watching people leave.

Thanking them. Helping load vehicles. Being professional.

Being empty.

Because Noel's words kept echoing in his head.

*"Not today. Please."*

The way his voice had cracked on "please."

The way he'd looked at Ebenâ€”raw and hurt and barely holding it together.

The way he'd walked away without looking back.

Eben had wanted to follow.

Had wanted to push.

Had wanted to say: *I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I love you.*

But he hadn't.

Because Noel had asked him not to.

Had said "please" in that broken voice.

And Eben couldn'tâ€”

He couldn't ignore that.

Couldn't push when Noel was barely holding on.

So he'd let him go.

Again.

---

The warehouse was emptying.

People trickling out. Calling goodbyes. Thanking Eben for the space.

He nodded. Smiled. Said the right things.

And felt nothing.

Justâ€”hollow.

Like he'd scooped out everything that mattered and left only the shell.

---

He saw Noel near the exit.

Talking to Wes. Smiling. Looking perfectly fine.

That bright, practiced smile that meant absolutely nothing.

Eben's chest tightened.

Because he knew that smile.

Knew what it cost.

Knew that underneath it, Noel was breaking.

And it was Eben's fault.

---

Noel left without saying goodbye.

Justâ€”walked out.

Got in his car.

Drove away.

Efficient. Mechanical. No hesitation.

Like he couldn't get out of there fast enough.

Eben stood in the doorway and watched him go.

And thought: *I'm losing him.*

*I've already lost him.*

*And I don't know how to get him back.*

---

**NOEL**

Noel made it to his car before his hands started shaking.

Made it out of the parking lot before his vision blurred.

Made it three blocks before he had to pull over.

He sat there, engine running, hands gripping the steering wheel, and tried to breathe.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*You got through it.*

*You didn't break.*

But the lie felt thin.

Fragile.

Like one more thingâ€”one more look, one more word, one more momentâ€”would shatter it completely.

---

Being in Eben's space had beenâ€”

Unbearable.

Seeing where he worked. Where he'd built his walls. Where he felt safe.

Seeing how empty it was.

How controlled.

How perfectly designed to keep people out.

And Noel had thoughtâ€”stupidly, naivelyâ€”that he'd been different.

That he'd gotten past those walls.

That Eben had let him in.

But he hadn't.

Not really.

Because the second it got realâ€”the second Eben had to chooseâ€”he'd chosen the walls.

Chosen the empty warehouse.

Chosen safety over Noel.

---

And that almost-conversation.

That moment in the back shelving.

Just them.

Alone.

Eben trying to say something.

Noel stopping him.

*"Not today. Please."*

His voice had cracked.

He'd heard it crack.

Had felt the mask slip.

Had been so close to breaking right there in front of Eben.

So he'd walked away.

Because what else could he do?

He wasn't ready.

Wasn't ready to hear whatever Eben wanted to say.

Wasn't ready to hope.

Wasn't ready to be hurt again.

---

Noel sat in his car and stared at the ribbon on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a scar.

His fingers moved to untie it.

Stopped.

*Not yet,* he thought. *Not yet.*

Because taking it off would mean accepting that it was over.

Would mean letting go.

Would mean admitting that "temporary" had always been the truth.

And he wasn't ready for that.

Not yet.

Maybe not ever.

---

He took a breath.

Put the car in drive.

And headed home.

To his empty apartment.

To his cold bed.

To the silence that used to feel comfortable and now just feltâ€”

Lonely.

---

**EBEN**

The warehouse was empty.

Everyone gone. Event over. Just Eben and the space he'd built.

The space that had always feltâ€”right.

Organized. Controlled. Safe.

But nowâ€”

Now it just felt wrong.

Too quiet.

Too empty.

Too much like exactly what it was.

A place designed to keep people out.

---

Eben walked through the warehouse.

Past the shelving. Past the staging area. Past the spot where he'd stood with Sam.

Past the place where Noel had said "please" in that broken voice.

And he thought: *This is what I chose.*

*This is what I protected.*

*This empty space.*

*These walls.*

*This loneliness.*

---

He'd built this.

All of it.

The systems. The organization. The careful distance.

Had spent years perfecting it.

Making it efficient. Making it safe. Making it impossible for anyone to get close enough to hurt him.

And it had worked.

For years, it had worked.

He'd been safe. Protected. Invulnerable.

And completely, utterly alone.

---

Until Noel.

Noel, who'd walked into his life and made him want things he'd spent years avoiding.

Connection. Vulnerability. Trust.

Love.

Noel, who'd looked at all of Eben's walls and said: *I see you anyway.*

Noel, who'd been patient. Kind. Willing to wait while Eben figured out how to let him in.

Noel, who'd said *I love you* first.

And Eben had destroyed it.

Had taken that gift and thrown it away.

Had chosen fear over love.

Walls over connection.

Safety over everything that mattered.

---

Eben stood in the middle of his empty warehouse and thought: *I can't do this anymore.*

*I can't keep choosing this.*

*I can't keep choosing to be alone.*

Because the alternativeâ€”

The alternative was losing Noel.

Was spending the rest of his life in this empty space.

Was never knowing what it felt like to be brave enough to keep something good.

And thatâ€”

That was unacceptable.

---

Tomorrow.

Christmas Eve.

He'd fix this.

He'd apologize. Explain. Tell Noel the truth.

*I was scared. I didn't mean it. I love you. I'm choosing you.*

And if Noel said noâ€”

If Noel couldn't forgive himâ€”

Then Eben would live with it.

Would accept the consequence.

Would know that he'd tried.

But he had to try.

Had to fight.

Had to choose Noel over his fear.

Even if it terrified him.

Even if he didn't know how.

Even if he failed.

---

Eben locked up the warehouse.

Got in his truck.

Drove home through the dark streets.

The storm had passed. The sky was clearing. Stars visible through the breaking clouds.

Tomorrow would be Christmas Eve.

The last day of the festival.

The last chance.

And Eben was going to take it.

Was going to choose differently.

Was going to be brave.

Even if it killed him.

---

**NOEL**

Noel's apartment was dark.

Cold.

Empty.

He stood in the doorway and thought: *This is my life.*

*This is what I go back to.*

*This is what I've always had.*

And it had been enough.

Before.

Before Eben.

Before he'd learned what it felt like to not be alone.

Before he'd let himself hope.

Nowâ€”

Now it just feltâ€”

Unbearable.

---

He went through the motions.

Shower. Pajamas. Tea he didn't drink.

Sat on the couch. Stared at nothing.

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

He couldn't take it off.

Couldn't let go.

Couldn't accept that it was over.

Even though it was.

Even though Eben had made that clear.

Even though "this was never supposed to last" was the truth.

---

Tomorrow was Christmas Eve.

The last day of the festival.

One more day of pretending.

One more day of smiling.

One more day of being useful.

And thenâ€”

And then it would be over.

The festival would end.

The town would go back to normal.

And Noel would go back toâ€”

This.

Empty apartment. Cold bed. Silence.

The way it had always been.

The way it would always be.

---

He looked at the ribbon.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a lie.

And thought: *Maybe I should have known better than to hope.*

*Maybe temporary was always the only thing I was ever going to get.*

*Maybe that's all I'm worth.*

The thought settled in his chest like lead.

Heavy. Suffocating. True.

Because if he'd been worth moreâ€”

If he'd been enoughâ€”

Eben would have chosen him.

Would have fought for him.

Would have said "I want this to last" instead of "this was never supposed to last."

But he hadn't.

And Noel knew what that meant.

---

He went to bed.

Lay there in the dark.

Stared at the empty side of the bed.

The side where Eben had slept.

Where he'd woken up that one perfect morning and looked at Noel like he was everything.

Before the fear won.

Before the walls went back up.

Before everything broke.

---

Noel closed his eyes.

And thought: *One more day.*

*Just get through one more day.*

*And then it's over.*

The thought should have been comforting.

Should have felt like relief.

Should have felt like the end of something painful.

But it didn't.

It just feltâ€”

Empty.

Like everything else.
## Chapter 6: The Realization

**EBEN**

Eben didn't sleep.

Couldn't sleep.

Just lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying everything.

Sam's words.

Noel's "please."

The empty warehouse.

The choice he had to make.

---

*"You're destroying something before it can hurt you."*

Sam had said it like it was obvious.

Like it was a pattern Eben had been running his entire life.

And he had been.

Eben could see it now.

Every time something got too closeâ€”too realâ€”he'd found a way to end it.

Jobs. Friendships. Anything that started to matter.

He'd destroy it first.

Before it could destroy him.

It was automatic. Instinctive. The survival pattern he'd learned so long ago he didn't even remember learning it.

*If you don't need anyone, no one can leave you.*

*If you don't attach, you can't be hurt.*

*If you destroy it first, you stay in control.*

It had worked.

For years, it had worked.

He'd been safe.

Protected.

Alone.

---

And then Noel.

Noel, who'd slipped past every defense without even trying.

Who'd made Eben laugh. Made him care. Made him want to stay.

Who'd looked at Eben's walls and said: *I see you anyway.*

And Eben hadâ€”

He'd fallen.

Completely. Devastatingly. Irreversibly.

Had fallen so hard he didn't know how to function without Noel anymore.

And that had terrified him.

Because needing someone that much meant they could hurt you.

Meant they could leave.

Meant you were vulnerable in a way you couldn't control.

So Eben had done what he always did.

He'd destroyed it.

Had said the worst possible thing.

Had watched Noel's face go blank.

Had chosen fear over love.

---

Exceptâ€”

Except he hadn't stayed safe.

Hadn't protected himself.

Hadn't avoided the pain.

He'd justâ€”

He'd just made it worse.

Because now he was alone.

And Noel was gone.

And Eben had to live with the knowledge that he'd done this.

That he'd destroyed the best thing that ever happened to him.

On purpose.

Because he'd been too scared to keep it.

---

Eben got out of bed.

Couldn't lie there anymore.

Couldn't keep replaying the same thoughts over and over.

He went to the kitchen. Made coffee. Didn't drink it.

Stood at the window, watching the dark street, and thought: *What am I going to say?*

Tomorrow.

Christmas Eve was coming.

He'd apologize.

But how?

What words could possibly fix what he'd broken?

---

*I'm sorry.*

Too simple. Too easy. Not enough.

*I didn't mean it.*

True. But not the whole truth.

*I was scared.*

Also true. But not an excuse.

*I love you.*

The truest thing.

But would Noel believe him?

Would Noel even want to hear it?

---

Eben thought about Noel's face when he'd said "please."

The way his voice had cracked.

The way he'd lookedâ€”raw and hurt and barely holding on.

The way he'd walked away without looking back.

And Eben thought: *He's not ready.*

*He's not ready to hear this.*

*He's not ready to trust me again.*

But Eben had to try anyway.

Had to show up.

Had to choose Noel.

Even if Noel chose not to choose him back.

---

The sky was starting to lighten.

Dawn coming.

Two more days until Christmas.

Two more days of the festival.

Two more chances.

Eben stood at the window and thought: *I have to get this right.*

*I have to find the words.*

*I have to make him understand.*

But what if there were no right words?

What if nothing he said could fix this?

What if he'd broken it too badly?

---

*Then you live with it,* Sam's voice echoed in his head. *Because that's the consequence of what you did. And you don't get to run from consequences.*

Eben took a breath.

Sam was right.

He was always right.

If Noel said noâ€”

If Noel couldn't forgive himâ€”

Then Eben would accept it.

Would live with the consequence.

Would know that he'd tried.

But he had to try.

Had to fight.

Had to be brave enough to risk being hurt.

Because the alternativeâ€”

The alternative was spending the rest of his life wondering.

Regretting.

Knowing he'd been too much of a coward to fight for what mattered.

And thatâ€”

That was worse than any rejection.

---

Eben finished his coffee.

Showered. Dressed. Tried to prepare himself.

For what, he didn't know.

For Noel's anger. His hurt. His blank acceptance.

For the possibility that it was too late.

For the possibility that Noel had already let go.

For the possibility that "temporary" was all they'd ever have.

---

But he had to try.

Had to show up.

Had to choose Noel.

Even if it terrified him.

Even if he failed.

Even if it broke him.

Because Noel was worth it.

Was worth the risk.

Was worth being brave for.

And Eben was done choosing fear.

Done choosing walls.

Done choosing to be alone.

---

His phone was on the counter.

The email was still there. The January contract. The job that would take him out of state for three months. The exit he'd been keeping in his back pocket.

Just in case.

Just in case it got too hard. Just in case he needed to run. Just in case staying meant risking everything.

Eben picked up the phone.

Opened the email.

His thumb hovered over the reply button.

He could still take it. Could still leave. Could still protect himself the way he always had.

But that was the old pattern.

And the old pattern had cost him Noel.

He typed: *Thank you for the opportunity. I'm no longer available for January. I've decided to stay local.*

Read it twice.

Hit send.

The message disappeared. Gone. Irreversible.

Eben put the phone down.

Stood there for a moment.

He'd just closed the exit. Burned the escape route. Committed to being hereâ€”in Tinsel Town, in January, in whatever came nextâ€”without any guarantee that Noel would want him.

It felt terrifying.

It felt right.

---

He grabbed his keys.

Headed for the door.

Stopped.

Went back to his bedroom.

Opened the drawer where he'd put it.

The small box. The thing he'd bought weeks ago, before everything fell apart.

Before he'd destroyed it.

He'd been planningâ€”

He'd been planning to give it to Noel on Christmas.

Had been planning to say: *I want this to last. I want you to stay.*

But then he'd panicked.

Had said the opposite.

Had destroyed everything.

---

Eben picked up the box.

Opened it.

Inside: a key.

To the warehouse.

To Frost Line Logistics.

To the space Eben had built to keep people out.

He'd had it made for Noel.

Had been planning to give it to him and say: *You're welcome here. Always. This is your space too.*

It had feltâ€”significant.

Terrifying.

Right.

And then he'd ruined it.

---

Eben closed the box.

Put it in his pocket.

He didn't know if he'd give it to Noel today.

Didn't know if Noel would want it.

Didn't know if it would mean anything anymore.

But he brought it anyway.

Just in case.

Justâ€”

Just in case.

---

He left the apartment.

Got in his truck.

Drove toward Evergreen Square.

Toward the festival.

Toward Noel.

Toward whatever came next.

The sun was rising.

Two more days.

Two more chances.

And Eben was going to take it.

Was going to be brave.

Was going to choose Noel.

Even if it killed him.

Especially if it killed him.

Because some things were worth dying for.

And Noel was one of them.
## Chapter 7: The Precipice

**NOEL**

Two more days.

Two more days until Christmas. Two more days of the Twelve Days of Tinsel Town.

Tomorrow was Christmas Eve. Tomorrow was the real last chance.

But todayâ€”

Today, he still had to see Eben.

Noel lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, and thought: *One more day.*

*Just get through one more day.*

*And then you can fall apart.*

The thought should have been comforting.

It wasn't.

---

He got up.

Went through the motions.

Shower. Coffee. The nice clothes that said *I'm fine.*

The mask.

Always the mask.

He was so tired of the mask.

But what choice did he have?

If he let it slipâ€”

If he let people seeâ€”

They'd ask questions. Offer sympathy. Try to help.

And Noel didn't want help.

Didn't want pity.

Didn't want anyone to see how completely he'd fallen apart.

So he put on the mask.

Smiled at his reflection.

And prepared for one more performance.

---

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

He'd tried to take it off last night.

Had sat there, fingers on the knot, ready to untie it.

Couldn't.

Because taking it off would mean accepting that it was over.

Would mean letting go of the last piece of evidence that any of it had been real.

And he wasn't ready.

Might never be ready.

So he left it.

Left the ribbon on his wrist like a scar.

Like a reminder.

Like proof that he'd been stupid enough to hope.

---

His phone buzzed.

A text from Mayor Kringle: *Big day! Charity cleanup at the rink! Let's make it happen!*

Too many exclamation points.

Too much enthusiasm.

Noel stared at the message and thought: *I can't do this.*

*I can't smile through one more day.*

*I can't pretend I'm fine when I'm breaking.*

But he would.

Because that's what he did.

That's what he'd always done.

Useful. Reliable. Fine.

Even when he wasn't.

Especially when he wasn't.

---

He grabbed his keys.

Headed for the door.

Stopped.

Looked back at his apartment.

At the empty space. The cold bed. The silence.

This was his life.

This was what he had.

This was what he'd go back to after today.

After the festival ended.

After Ebenâ€”

After Eben was gone.

Really gone.

Not just distant.

Not just avoiding him.

Actually gone.

Because there'd be no more events. No more excuses to be in the same space.

No more accidental eye contact across crowded squares.

No more almost-conversations.

Justâ€”

Nothing.

---

Noel's chest tightened.

He couldn't breathe.

Couldn't think.

Couldn'tâ€”

He pressed his hand against the wall.

Tried to ground himself.

Tried to remember how to function.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*Just one more day.*

*Just get through one more day.*

The lie felt thinner than ever.

But it was all he had.

---

**EBEN**

Eben arrived at Evergreen Square early.

Before the crowds. Before the chaos. Before Noel.

He neededâ€”

He needed a moment.

Needed to prepare himself.

Needed to figure out what he was going to say.

---

The square was quiet.

Peaceful.

The calm before the storm.

Decorations everywhere. Lights twinkling. The festival in its final glory.

Tomorrow, it would all come down.

Tomorrow, the town would go back to normal.

Tomorrow, this would all be over.

And Eben would either have Noel back.

Or he wouldn't.

---

He sat on a bench.

Pulled out the small box.

Opened it.

The key gleamed in the morning light.

Simple. Practical. Significant.

A key to his space.

To the place he'd built to keep people out.

He'd been planning to give it to Noel on Christmas.

Had been planning to say: *I want you here. I want this to last. I want you.*

And then he'd panicked.

Had destroyed it.

Had said the opposite.

---

Could he give it to Noel now?

Would it mean anything?

Or would it just beâ€”

Too little, too late.

A gesture that couldn't fix what he'd broken.

Eben didn't know.

But he had to try.

Had to show Noel that he meant it.

That he was choosing differently.

That he was choosing Noel.

---

"You're here early."

Wes's voice.

Eben looked up.

Wes was standing there, holding two coffees, looking at Eben with something that might have been sympathy.

"Yeah," Eben said. "Couldn't sleep."

"I can imagine." Wes handed him a coffee. Sat down beside him. "You look like hell."

"Thanks."

"You're welcome." Wes sipped his coffee. "You going to fix this?"

"I'm going to try."

"Good." Wes was quiet for a moment. Then: "He's breaking, you know."

Eben's chest tightened. "I know."

"He's pretending he's fine. Smiling at everyone. Being useful. But he's breaking."

"I know."

"Do you?" Wes's voice was sharp. "Because from where I'm sitting, you broke him. And I'm not sure you understand what that means."

Eben looked away. "I understand."

"Do you? Because Noel doesn't let people in. Ever. He smiles and helps and makes himself indispensable, but he doesn'tâ€”he doesn't trust people with the real parts of himself."

"I know."

"He trusted you." Wes's voice was quiet. Hard. "He let you in. Really in. And youâ€”"

"I destroyed it. I know."

"So what are you going to do about it?"

"I'm going to apologize. I'm going to tell him the truth. I'm going toâ€”" Eben stopped. "I'm going to choose him. Even if he doesn't choose me back."

Wes studied him for a long moment.

Then nodded. "Good. Because he deserves that. Deserves someone who fights for him. Who chooses him. Who doesn't run when it gets hard."

"I know."

"Then don't screw it up."

Wes stood. Walked away.

And Eben sat there, holding his coffee, and thought: *Don't screw it up.*

*Right.*

*No pressure.*

**NOEL**

Noel arrived at the square and immediately saw Eben.

Sitting on a bench. Alone. Lookingâ€”

Tired.

Sad.

Lost.

Noel's heart stuttered.

He wanted to go to him.

Wanted to sit beside him.

Wanted to ask if he was okay.

But he couldn't.

Because they weren'tâ€”

They weren't that anymore.

Weren't anything.

Just two people who used toâ€”

Who used to be everything.

And now were nothing.

---

Eben looked up.

Their eyes met.

And for a momentâ€”just a momentâ€”Noel saw it.

Saw the regret. The pain. The desperate want.

Saw Eben.

The real Eben.

The one who felt everything and was terrified of it.

The one who'd said *I love you* and meant it.

The one who'd destroyed them because he didn't know how to keep them.

---

Noel looked away first.

Couldn't handle it.

Couldn't handle the way Eben was looking at him.

Like he wanted to say something.

Like he wanted to fix this.

Like he thought there was anything left to fix.

---

The day began.

The charity cleanup. Day ten of the festival.

Dec 23 in Tinsel Town.

People arrived. Vendors set up. The square filled with life and laughter and holiday cheer.

And Noel moved through it like a ghost.

Smiling. Helping. Being useful.

Dying inside.

---

They orbited each other all day.

Never touching. Never speaking directly.

But alwaysâ€”alwaysâ€”aware.

Noel felt Eben's presence like a physical thing.

Could track his position without looking.

Could sense when he was near.

Could feel the weight of his gaze.

It was torture.

---

Eben watched Noel smile at strangers.

Watched him help vendors.

Watched him be everything to everyone.

Except himself.

And Eben thought: *I did this.*

*I made him retreat.*

*I made him put the mask back on.*

*I made him believe he wasn't enough.*

---

The day wore on.

Events. Activities. The final celebration.

Everyone seemed happy.

Everyone except the two people who'd made it all possible.

Who stood in the same space.

And felt miles apart.

---

**NOEL**

As the sun started to set, Noel found himself alone for a moment.

Standing near the edge of the square. Away from the crowd.

Justâ€”breathing.

Trying to hold it together for a few more hours.

Tomorrow, it would be over.

Tomorrow, he could fall apart.

Tomorrowâ€”

"Noel."

Eben's voice.

Quiet. Careful. Close.

Noel's entire body went rigid.

He didn't turn around.

Couldn't turn around.

Because if he looked at Ebenâ€”

If he saw his faceâ€”

He might break.

And he couldn't break.

Not here.

Not now.

Not when he'd made it this far.

"Not now," Noel said quietly. "Please."

His voice didn't crack this time.

He was proud of that.

"Noel, I need toâ€”"

"Not now, Eben." Noel's hands clenched. "I can'tâ€”I can't do this right now."

Silence.

Then: "Okay."

Eben's voice was soft. Broken.

"Tomorrow," Eben said. "Can weâ€”can we talk tomorrow?"

Noel closed his eyes.

Tomorrow.

After the festival.

After it was all over.

After there was no reason to see each other anymore.

"Maybe," Noel said.

It was the best he could offer.

The most honest thing he could say.

Because he didn't know.

Didn't know if he could handle talking to Eben.

Didn't know if he could hear whatever Eben wanted to say.

Didn't know if he could survive it.

---

Eben didn't push.

Just said: "Okay."

And walked away.

And Noel stood there, alone, and thought: *One more day.*

*Just one more day.*

*And then it's over.*

The thought felt like a death sentence.
## Chapter 8: Hook Ending

**NOEL**

The day ended at sunset.

Another event finished. Ten down, two to go.

People headed home, tired but cheerful. Vendors packed up. Volunteers waved goodbye until tomorrow.

Noel stood in the square and feltâ€”

Nothing.

Empty.

Like heâ€™d used up everything he had just getting through the day.

And now there was nothing left.

---

The crowd thinned.

People heading home. Getting ready for the final stretch.

Two more days of festival. Then it would really be over.

And Noelâ€”

Noel didn't know what to do.

Didn't know where to go.

Didn't know how to exist in a world where he didn't have an excuse to see Eben anymore.

---

He helped with cleanup.

Because that's what he did.

Made himself useful. Stayed busy. Didn't think.

Packed boxes. Folded tables. Organized donations.

Moved on autopilot.

Smiled when people thanked him.

Said "you're welcome" and "happy holidays" and "see you next year."

Lied.

Over and over.

Until the lies felt like the only truth he had left.

---

The square emptied.

Just a few stragglers left. The cleanup crew. The people who stayed until the end.

Noel was one of them.

Always one of them.

The person who stayed. Who helped. Who made sure everything was taken care of.

Even when he was breaking.

Especially when he was breaking.

---

"Noel."

Hugh's voice. Quiet. Concerned.

Noel turned.

Hugh was standing there, holding a box of decorations, looking at Noel with something that might have been worry.

"You okay?" Hugh asked.

"Yeah," Noel said automatically. "Justâ€”tired."

"That's not what I meant."

"I'm fine, Hugh."

"You're not fine." Hugh set down the box. "You haven't been fine for days. And Iâ€”" He paused. "I'm worried about you."

Noel's throat tightened.

"I'm fine," he said again.

But his voice cracked.

Just slightly.

Just enough.

---

Hugh stepped closer.

"What happened?" he asked quietly. "With you and Eben?"

"Nothing."

"Noelâ€”"

"Nothing happened. We're fine. Everything's fine."

"You're lying."

"I'm notâ€”"

"You are." Hugh's voice was gentle. Kind. "And I get it. I get that you don't want to talk about it. Butâ€”" He paused. "You don't have to pretend with me. You don't have to be fine."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Because Noel did have to be fine.

Had to pretend.

Had to keep the mask on.

Because if he let it slipâ€”

If he let people seeâ€”

They'd know.

They'd know how completely he'd fallen apart.

How much he'd let himself hope.

How devastatingly wrong he'd been.

---

"I'm fine," Noel said one more time.

Hugh looked at him for a long moment.

Then sighed. "Okay. But if you need anythingâ€”"

"I know. Thanks."

Hugh walked away.

And Noel stood there, alone in the emptying square, and thought: *I'm not fine.*

*I'm breaking.*

*And I don't know how to stop.*

---

He finished cleanup.

Packed the last box. Folded the last table. Turned off the last string of lights.

The square was dark now.

Empty.

Silent.

The festival was over.

And Noelâ€”

Noel had nothing left.

No more events. No more excuses. No more reasons to smile.

Justâ€”

Nothing.

---

He walked to his car.

Got in.

Sat there, hands on the wheel, and stared at the empty square.

Tomorrow was Christmas Eve.

The day after that, Christmas.

And Noel would go back toâ€”

What?

His empty apartment? His cold bed? His silent life?

The thought made him want to scream.

---

He looked at the ribbon on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a scar.

His fingers moved to untie it.

Stopped.

*Not yet,* he thought. *Not yet.*

Because taking it off would mean accepting that it was over.

Would mean letting go.

Would mean admitting that "temporary" had always been the truth.

And he wasn't ready.

Might never be ready.

---

Noel started the car.

Drove home through the dark streets.

The town was quiet. Peaceful. Everyone resting up for Christmas Eve tomorrow.

And Noel was alone.

The way he'd always been.

The way he'd always known he would be.

---

His apartment was dark.

Cold.

Empty.

He stood in the doorway and thought: *This is my life.*

*This is what I have.*

*This is all I've ever had.*

And it had been enough.

Before.

Before Eben.

Before he'd learned what it felt like to not be alone.

Before he'd let himself believe.

Nowâ€”

Now it feltâ€”

Unbearable.

---

He went to bed.

Lay there in the dark.

Stared at the empty side of the bed.

The side where Eben had slept.

Where he'd woken up that one perfect morning and looked at Noel like he was everything.

Before the fear won.

Before the walls went back up.

Before Eben said "this was never supposed to last."

---

Noel closed his eyes.

And thought: *Maybe he was right.*

*Maybe it was never supposed to last.*

*Maybe temporary was always the only thing I was ever going to get.*

The thought settled in his chest like lead.

Heavy. Suffocating. True.

Because if he'd been worth moreâ€”

If he'd been enoughâ€”

Eben would have chosen him.

Would have fought for him.

Would have said "I want this to last" instead of "this was never supposed to last."

But he hadn't.

And Noel knew what that meant.

---

He stared at the ribbon on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a lie.

And thought: *Maybe I should have known better than to hope.*

*Maybe useful was always the only thing I was ever going to be.*

*Maybe that's all I'm worth.*

---

The apartment was silent.

Dark.

Empty.

Just like Noel.

He lay there, staring at the ceiling, and thought: *Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.*

*And I'm alone.*

*The way I've always been.*

*The way I'll always be.*

The thought didn't hurt anymore.

It justâ€”

It just was.

A fact. A truth. A reality he'd been avoiding.

But nowâ€”

Now he had to accept it.

Had to let go.

Had to move on.

---

Except he couldn't.

Couldn't take off the ribbon.

Couldn't let go of the hope.

Couldn't accept that it was over.

Even though it was.

Even though Eben had made that clear.

Even though "this was never supposed to last" was the truth.

---

Noel stared at the ribbon.

And thought: *Maybe I should have known better than to hope.*

*Maybe temporary was always the only thing I was ever going to get.*

*Maybeâ€”*

*Maybe that's all I deserve.*

The thought broke something inside him.

Something fundamental.

Something he didn't know how to fix.

---

He closed his eyes.

And let the darkness take him.

Tomorrow was Christmas Eve.

Tomorrow, he'd have to figure out how to exist in a world where Eben wasn't his.

Where Eben had never been his.

Where "temporary" was all he'd ever had.

But tonightâ€”

Tonight, he could lie here.

In the dark.

With the ribbon still on his wrist.

And pretendâ€”just for a momentâ€”that it had been real.

That he'd been enough.

That "this was never supposed to last" had been a lie.

Even though it wasn't.

Even though it never had been.

Even though Noel should have known better than to hope.

---

The ribbon gleamed in the darkness.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a scar.

A reminder of everything he'd lost.

Everything he'd never really had.

Noel stared at it and thought: *Maybe I should have known better than to hope.*

And finallyâ€”finallyâ€”let himself break.

In the dark.

Alone.

The way he'd always been.

The way he'd always known he would be.

The ribbon still on his wrist.

The only proof that any of it had been real.

Even if only for a moment.

Even if only temporarily.

Even if it had all been a beautiful, devastating mistake.
