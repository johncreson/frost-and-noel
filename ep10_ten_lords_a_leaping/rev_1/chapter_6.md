## Chapter 6: The Realization

**EBEN**

Eben didn't sleep.

Couldn't sleep.

Just lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying everything.

Sam's words.

Noel's "please."

The empty warehouse.

The choice he had to make.

---

*"You're destroying something before it can hurt you."*

Sam had said it like it was obvious.

Like it was a pattern Eben had been running his entire life.

And he had been.

Eben could see it now.

Every time something got too close—too real—he'd found a way to end it.

Jobs. Friendships. Anything that started to matter.

He'd destroy it first.

Before it could destroy him.

It was automatic. Instinctive. The survival pattern he'd learned so long ago he didn't even remember learning it.

*If you don't need anyone, no one can leave you.*

*If you don't attach, you can't be hurt.*

*If you destroy it first, you stay in control.*

It had worked.

For years, it had worked.

He'd been safe.

Protected.

Alone.

---

And then Noel.

Noel, who'd slipped past every defense without even trying.

Who'd made Eben laugh. Made him care. Made him want to stay.

Who'd looked at Eben's walls and said: *I see you anyway.*

And Eben had—

He'd fallen.

Completely. Devastatingly. Irreversibly.

Had fallen so hard he didn't know how to function without Noel anymore.

And that had terrified him.

Because needing someone that much meant they could hurt you.

Meant they could leave.

Meant you were vulnerable in a way you couldn't control.

So Eben had done what he always did.

He'd destroyed it.

Had said the worst possible thing.

Had watched Noel's face go blank.

Had chosen fear over love.

---

Except—

Except he hadn't stayed safe.

Hadn't protected himself.

Hadn't avoided the pain.

He'd just—

He'd just made it worse.

Because now he was alone.

And Noel was gone.

And Eben had to live with the knowledge that he'd done this.

That he'd destroyed the best thing that ever happened to him.

On purpose.

Because he'd been too scared to keep it.

---

Eben got out of bed.

Couldn't lie there anymore.

Couldn't keep replaying the same thoughts over and over.

He went to the kitchen. Made coffee. Didn't drink it.

Stood at the window, watching the dark street, and thought: *What am I going to say?*

Tomorrow.

Christmas Eve was coming.

He'd apologize.

But how?

What words could possibly fix what he'd broken?

---

*I'm sorry.*

Too simple. Too easy. Not enough.

*I didn't mean it.*

True. But not the whole truth.

*I was scared.*

Also true. But not an excuse.

*I love you.*

The truest thing.

But would Noel believe him?

Would Noel even want to hear it?

---

Eben thought about Noel's face when he'd said "please."

The way his voice had cracked.

The way he'd looked—raw and hurt and barely holding on.

The way he'd walked away without looking back.

And Eben thought: *He's not ready.*

*He's not ready to hear this.*

*He's not ready to trust me again.*

But Eben had to try anyway.

Had to show up.

Had to choose Noel.

Even if Noel chose not to choose him back.

---

The sky was starting to lighten.

Dawn coming.

Two more days until Christmas.

Two more days of the festival.

Two more chances.

Eben stood at the window and thought: *I have to get this right.*

*I have to find the words.*

*I have to make him understand.*

But what if there were no right words?

What if nothing he said could fix this?

What if he'd broken it too badly?

---

*Then you live with it,* Sam's voice echoed in his head. *Because that's the consequence of what you did. And you don't get to run from consequences.*

Eben took a breath.

Sam was right.

He was always right.

If Noel said no—

If Noel couldn't forgive him—

Then Eben would accept it.

Would live with the consequence.

Would know that he'd tried.

But he had to try.

Had to fight.

Had to be brave enough to risk being hurt.

Because the alternative—

The alternative was spending the rest of his life wondering.

Regretting.

Knowing he'd been too much of a coward to fight for what mattered.

And that—

That was worse than any rejection.

---

Eben finished his coffee.

Showered. Dressed. Tried to prepare himself.

For what, he didn't know.

For Noel's anger. His hurt. His blank acceptance.

For the possibility that it was too late.

For the possibility that Noel had already let go.

For the possibility that "temporary" was all they'd ever have.

---

But he had to try.

Had to show up.

Had to choose Noel.

Even if it terrified him.

Even if he failed.

Even if it broke him.

Because Noel was worth it.

Was worth the risk.

Was worth being brave for.

And Eben was done choosing fear.

Done choosing walls.

Done choosing to be alone.

---

His phone was on the counter.

The email was still there. The January contract. The job that would take him out of state for three months. The exit he'd been keeping in his back pocket.

Just in case.

Just in case it got too hard. Just in case he needed to run. Just in case staying meant risking everything.

Eben picked up the phone.

Opened the email.

His thumb hovered over the reply button.

He could still take it. Could still leave. Could still protect himself the way he always had.

But that was the old pattern.

And the old pattern had cost him Noel.

He typed: *Thank you for the opportunity. I'm no longer available for January. I've decided to stay local.*

Read it twice.

Hit send.

The message disappeared. Gone. Irreversible.

Eben put the phone down.

Stood there for a moment.

He'd just closed the exit. Burned the escape route. Committed to being here—in Tinsel Town, in January, in whatever came next—without any guarantee that Noel would want him.

It felt terrifying.

It felt right.

---

He grabbed his keys.

Headed for the door.

Stopped.

Went back to his bedroom.

Opened the drawer where he'd put it.

The small box. The thing he'd bought weeks ago, before everything fell apart.

Before he'd destroyed it.

He'd been planning—

He'd been planning to give it to Noel on Christmas.

Had been planning to say: *I want this to last. I want you to stay.*

But then he'd panicked.

Had said the opposite.

Had destroyed everything.

---

Eben picked up the box.

Opened it.

Inside: a key.

To the warehouse.

To Frost Line Logistics.

To the space Eben had built to keep people out.

He'd had it made for Noel.

Had been planning to give it to him and say: *You're welcome here. Always. This is your space too.*

It had felt—significant.

Terrifying.

Right.

And then he'd ruined it.

---

Eben closed the box.

Put it in his pocket.

He didn't know if he'd give it to Noel today.

Didn't know if Noel would want it.

Didn't know if it would mean anything anymore.

But he brought it anyway.

Just in case.

Just—

Just in case.

---

He left the apartment.

Got in his truck.

Drove toward Evergreen Square.

Toward the festival.

Toward Noel.

Toward whatever came next.

The sun was rising.

Two more days.

Two more chances.

And Eben was going to take it.

Was going to be brave.

Was going to choose Noel.

Even if it killed him.

Especially if it killed him.

Because some things were worth dying for.

And Noel was one of them.
