## Chapter 04: The Yearning

Noel had never been to Frost Line Logistics before.

Had never seen Eben's space. His work. The place he'd built.

And now he was here.

Standing in the middle of it.

Surrounded by Eben's careful organization. His systems. His control.

It felt—

Wrong.

And right.

And devastating.

---

The warehouse was exactly what Noel would have expected.

Clean. Organized. Efficient.

Everything labeled. Everything in its place. Everything controlled.

No personal touches. No photos. No evidence that a human being actually worked here.

Just—systems.

Like Eben had built a space that perfectly reflected who he pretended to be.

Cold. Distant. Untouchable.

Except Noel knew better.

Knew that underneath all that control was someone who felt everything.

Who was terrified of feeling everything.

Who'd rather destroy something beautiful than risk being hurt by it.

---

The event had settled into the space.

Tables set up. Donation bins organized. People browsing. Volunteers helping.

The charity tree haul, transplanted indoors.

It was working.

Everyone seemed fine with it.

Except Noel.

Who stood near the far wall, holding a clipboard he wasn't reading, and tried not to think about where he was.

Tried not to think about what it meant.

Tried not to think about Eben.

Failed.

---

*Don't miss him.*

*Don't miss him.*

*He made his choice.*

The mantra repeated in Noel's head like a prayer.

Like if he said it enough times, it might become true.

But it didn't work.

Because Eben was across the room.

And Noel's whole body knew exactly where he was.

Could track his position without looking.

Could sense his presence like a magnetic pull.

That was the cruelest part.

He couldn't stop feeling him.

Couldn't turn off the awareness.

Couldn't make his body forget what it had learned.

What it felt like to be close to Eben. To touch him. To be touched by him.

To feel safe. Wanted. Seen.

---

Someone called his name.

Noel turned. Smiled. Answered a question about donation sorting.

Went back to his clipboard.

His hands were shaking slightly.

He pressed them flat against the paper.

*Get it together,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*You've done this before.*

*You can get through one afternoon.*

The lie tasted familiar.

Comfortable, even.

Like an old friend he'd known his entire life.

---

The warehouse was cold.

Industrial. Impersonal.

So empty.

Noel looked around at the shelving. The organization. The complete lack of anything personal.

And thought: *This is where Eben feels safe.*

*This is what he built when he decided not to need anyone.*

*This is what I was competing with.*

The realization settled in his chest like lead.

Because how could Noel compete with this?

With walls this high. Systems this perfect. Control this complete.

He couldn't.

He'd never stood a chance.

---

The storm raged outside.

Rain pounding against the roof. Wind howling. Thunder rolling in the distance.

Inside, the warehouse was warm. Bright. Full of people.

But Noel felt cold.

Alone.

Even surrounded by the town. Even in the middle of the event.

Especially here.

In Eben's space.

Where everything was organized and nothing was personal and Noel could see—so clearly—exactly what Eben had chosen.

This.

Empty efficiency.

Safe distance.

Walls.

Instead of Noel.

---

He moved through the afternoon on autopilot.

Helping vendors. Organizing donations. Answering questions.

Smiling. Always smiling.

The performance of fine-ness.

He was very good at it.

Had been practicing his entire life.

---

At one point, he ended up near the coffee station.

Someone had set up a makeshift break area. Thermoses. Cups. Cookies from the Candle & Crumb.

Noel poured himself coffee he didn't want.

Stood there, holding the cup, staring at nothing.

"You okay?"

Hugh. Appearing beside him with his usual quiet concern.

"Yeah," Noel said automatically. "Just—taking a break."

"You sure?"

"I'm fine."

Hugh studied him for a moment. "You don't look fine."

"I'm fine."

"Noel—"

"I'm fine, Hugh. Really. Just—tired."

The lie came easily.

It always did.

Hugh didn't believe him. Noel could see it in his eyes.

But Hugh didn't push.

Just squeezed his shoulder. "If you need anything—"

"I know. Thanks."

Hugh walked away.

And Noel stood there, holding his coffee, and thought: *I'm not fine.*

*I'm breaking.*

*And nobody can see it.*

*Nobody ever sees it.*

---

He looked across the warehouse.

Found Eben without meaning to.

Eben was near the main staging area, talking to Mayor Kringle. Gesturing at something. Looking calm and collected and completely in control.

Like he belonged here.

In this empty, organized space.

Like this was where he was meant to be.

And maybe it was.

Maybe Noel had been the anomaly. The disruption. The thing that didn't fit into Eben's carefully controlled world.

Maybe "temporary" had always been the only option.

---

As if sensing his gaze, Eben looked up.

Their eyes met across the warehouse.

Everything stopped.

Noel's breath caught. His heart stuttered. His entire body went very still.

Eben's expression shifted. Something raw flickering in his eyes.

Want. Regret. Pain.

For a moment—just a moment—Noel saw it.

Saw past the control. Past the walls. Past the careful distance.

Saw Eben.

The real Eben.

The one who felt everything and was terrified of it.

The one who'd said *I love you* and meant it.

The one who'd destroyed them because he was too scared to keep them.

---

Noel wanted to look away.

Couldn't.

Wanted to move.

Couldn't.

Wanted to stop feeling this.

Couldn't.

The distance between them felt infinite.

Unbridgeable.

A chasm Noel didn't know how to cross.

Didn't know if he should cross.

Didn't know if Eben wanted him to cross.

---

Someone called Noel's name.

The moment broke.

Noel turned away.

Forced himself to focus on the vendor who needed help.

Forced himself to smile.

Forced himself to breathe.

But his hands were shaking.

And his chest felt too tight.

And he couldn't stop thinking about the way Eben had looked at him.

Like he was drowning.

Like he wanted to reach out.

Like he didn't know how.

---

*Don't hope,* Noel told himself. *Don't you dare hope.*

Because hope was dangerous.

Hope had teeth.

Hope would destroy him faster than anything else.

He'd learned that lesson. Painfully. Devastatingly.

He wouldn't make that mistake again.

---

The afternoon dragged on.

The event continued. People browsed. Donations were sorted. The charity tree haul was a success despite the storm.

Everyone seemed happy.

Except Noel.

Who moved through the warehouse like a ghost.

Present but not present.

Smiling but not smiling.

Fine but not fine.

---

He found himself near the back shelving at one point.

Away from the crowd. Away from the noise.

Just—standing there.

In the quiet space between the rows.

Surrounded by Eben's organization. His systems. His control.

And Noel thought: *This is what he chose.*

*This empty, organized space.*

*This is what he wanted more than me.*

The thought hurt.

More than it should.

More than Noel wanted to admit.

Because he'd known—hadn't he?—that this was how it would end.

He'd known from the beginning that he wasn't enough.

That "useful" was all he'd ever be.

That temporary was the only thing he'd ever get.

He'd just—

He'd just forgotten.

For a moment.

For a brief, perfect, devastating moment.

He'd let himself believe.

---

"Noel."

Eben's voice.

Quiet. Careful.

Noel's entire body went rigid.

He turned.

Eben was standing a few feet away. Hands in his pockets. Expression unreadable.

They were alone.

Hidden by the shelving. Away from the crowd.

Just them.

In Eben's space.

In the quiet.

---

Noel's heart was pounding so hard it hurt.

"Eben," he said. His voice sounded normal. Good.

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Seemed to be struggling with something.

"I—" he started.

Noel's chest tightened.

*Don't,* he thought. *Please don't.*

*I can't do this.*

*Not today.*

*Not here.*

"Don't," Noel said quietly.

Eben stopped.

"I need to—" Eben tried again.

"Not today." Noel's voice cracked. "Please."

The word came out broken.

Raw.

Honest in a way Noel hadn't meant it to be.

---

Eben went very still.

Something shifted in his expression. Pain. Understanding. Regret.

"Okay," he said quietly.

He didn't move.

Didn't leave.

Just stood there, looking at Noel like he was something precious and broken and Eben didn't know how to fix it.

Noel couldn't handle it.

Couldn't handle the way Eben was looking at him.

Couldn't handle being this close.

Couldn't handle the way his body wanted to reach out.

Wanted to close the distance.

Wanted to believe that maybe—

No.

No.

He couldn't do this.

---

"I have to go," Noel said.

He walked away.

Didn't look back.

Didn't let himself look back.

Because if he looked back—

If he saw Eben's face—

He might break.

And he couldn't break.

Not here.

Not in front of everyone.

Not when he'd worked so hard to hold it together.

---

Noel made it to the front of the warehouse.

Found a quiet corner.

Pressed his back against the wall.

And tried to breathe.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*Just get through the rest of the day.*

*Just get through this.*

But his hands were shaking.

And his chest was too tight.

And he could still feel Eben's presence.

Could still see the way he'd looked at Noel.

Like he wanted to say something.

Like he wanted to fix this.

Like he didn't know how.

---

*Don't hope,* Noel thought again. *Don't you dare hope.*

Because hope would destroy him.

Hope would make him believe that maybe Eben regretted it.

Maybe Eben wanted him back.

Maybe "this was never supposed to last" wasn't the truth.

And Noel couldn't afford to believe that.

Couldn't afford to hope.

Couldn't afford to be wrong again.

---

The storm continued outside.

The event continued inside.

And Noel stood in the corner of Eben's warehouse, surrounded by people, and felt more alone than he'd ever felt in his life.

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a lie.

A reminder of everything he'd lost.

Everything he'd never really had.

Noel stared at it and thought: *I should take it off.*

*I should let go.*

*I should accept that it's over.*

But he couldn't.

Not yet.

Not when it was the only proof that any of it had been real.

Even if only for a moment.

Even if only temporarily.

Even if it had all been a mistake.

---

Someone called his name.

Noel took a breath.

Put on his smile.

And went back to work.

Back to being useful.

Back to pretending he was fine.

Because that's what he did.

That's what he'd always done.

And he was very, very good at it.
