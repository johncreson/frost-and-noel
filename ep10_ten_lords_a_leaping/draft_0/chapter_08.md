## Chapter 08: Hook Ending

The festival ended at sunset.

The final event. The last celebration. The Twelve Days of Tinsel Town, complete.

People gathered for the closing ceremony. Mayor Kringle gave a speech. There were thank-yous and applause and promises to do it all again next year.

Noel stood in the crowd and felt—

Nothing.

Empty.

Like he'd used up everything he had just getting through the day.

And now there was nothing left.

---

The crowd dispersed.

People heading home. Vendors packing up. Volunteers saying goodbye.

The festival was over.

And Noel—

Noel didn't know what to do.

Didn't know where to go.

Didn't know how to exist in a world where he didn't have an excuse to see Eben anymore.

---

He helped with cleanup.

Because that's what he did.

Made himself useful. Stayed busy. Didn't think.

Packed boxes. Folded tables. Organized donations.

Moved on autopilot.

Smiled when people thanked him.

Said "you're welcome" and "happy holidays" and "see you next year."

Lied.

Over and over.

Until the lies felt like the only truth he had left.

---

The square emptied.

Just a few stragglers left. The cleanup crew. The people who stayed until the end.

Noel was one of them.

Always one of them.

The person who stayed. Who helped. Who made sure everything was taken care of.

Even when he was breaking.

Especially when he was breaking.

---

"Noel."

Hugh's voice. Quiet. Concerned.

Noel turned.

Hugh was standing there, holding a box of decorations, looking at Noel with something that might have been worry.

"You okay?" Hugh asked.

"Yeah," Noel said automatically. "Just—tired."

"That's not what I meant."

"I'm fine, Hugh."

"You're not fine." Hugh set down the box. "You haven't been fine for days. And I—" He paused. "I'm worried about you."

Noel's throat tightened.

"I'm fine," he said again.

But his voice cracked.

Just slightly.

Just enough.

---

Hugh stepped closer.

"What happened?" he asked quietly. "With you and Eben?"

"Nothing."

"Noel—"

"Nothing happened. We're fine. Everything's fine."

"You're lying."

"I'm not—"

"You are." Hugh's voice was gentle. Kind. "And I get it. I get that you don't want to talk about it. But—" He paused. "You don't have to pretend with me. You don't have to be fine."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Because Noel did have to be fine.

Had to pretend.

Had to keep the mask on.

Because if he let it slip—

If he let people see—

They'd know.

They'd know how completely he'd fallen apart.

How much he'd let himself hope.

How devastatingly wrong he'd been.

---

"I'm fine," Noel said one more time.

Hugh looked at him for a long moment.

Then sighed. "Okay. But if you need anything—"

"I know. Thanks."

Hugh walked away.

And Noel stood there, alone in the emptying square, and thought: *I'm not fine.*

*I'm breaking.*

*And I don't know how to stop.*

---

He finished cleanup.

Packed the last box. Folded the last table. Turned off the last string of lights.

The square was dark now.

Empty.

Silent.

The festival was over.

And Noel—

Noel had nothing left.

No more events. No more excuses. No more reasons to smile.

Just—

Nothing.

---

He walked to his car.

Got in.

Sat there, hands on the wheel, and stared at the empty square.

Tomorrow was Christmas.

The day after, the town would go back to normal.

And Noel would go back to—

What?

His empty apartment? His cold bed? His silent life?

The thought made him want to scream.

---

He looked at the ribbon on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a scar.

His fingers moved to untie it.

Stopped.

*Not yet,* he thought. *Not yet.*

Because taking it off would mean accepting that it was over.

Would mean letting go.

Would mean admitting that "temporary" had always been the truth.

And he wasn't ready.

Might never be ready.

---

Noel started the car.

Drove home through the dark streets.

The town was quiet. Peaceful. Everyone inside, celebrating Christmas Eve with their families.

And Noel was alone.

The way he'd always been.

The way he'd always known he would be.

---

His apartment was dark.

Cold.

Empty.

He stood in the doorway and thought: *This is my life.*

*This is what I have.*

*This is all I've ever had.*

And it had been enough.

Before.

Before Eben.

Before he'd learned what it felt like to not be alone.

Before he'd let himself believe.

Now—

Now it felt—

Unbearable.

---

He went to bed.

Lay there in the dark.

Stared at the empty side of the bed.

The side where Eben had slept.

Where he'd woken up that one perfect morning and looked at Noel like he was everything.

Before the fear won.

Before the walls went back up.

Before Eben said "this was never supposed to last."

---

Noel closed his eyes.

And thought: *Maybe he was right.*

*Maybe it was never supposed to last.*

*Maybe temporary was always the only thing I was ever going to get.*

The thought settled in his chest like lead.

Heavy. Suffocating. True.

Because if he'd been worth more—

If he'd been enough—

Eben would have chosen him.

Would have fought for him.

Would have said "I want this to last" instead of "this was never supposed to last."

But he hadn't.

And Noel knew what that meant.

---

He stared at the ribbon on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a lie.

And thought: *Maybe I should have known better than to hope.*

*Maybe useful was always the only thing I was ever going to be.*

*Maybe that's all I'm worth.*

---

The apartment was silent.

Dark.

Empty.

Just like Noel.

He lay there, staring at the ceiling, and thought: *Tomorrow is Christmas.*

*And I'm alone.*

*The way I've always been.*

*The way I'll always be.*

The thought didn't hurt anymore.

It just—

It just was.

A fact. A truth. A reality he'd been avoiding.

But now—

Now he had to accept it.

Had to let go.

Had to move on.

---

Except he couldn't.

Couldn't take off the ribbon.

Couldn't let go of the hope.

Couldn't accept that it was over.

Even though it was.

Even though Eben had made that clear.

Even though "this was never supposed to last" was the truth.

---

Noel stared at the ribbon.

And thought: *Maybe I should have known better than to hope.*

*Maybe temporary was always the only thing I was ever going to get.*

*Maybe—*

*Maybe that's all I deserve.*

The thought broke something inside him.

Something fundamental.

Something he didn't know how to fix.

---

He closed his eyes.

And let the darkness take him.

Tomorrow was Christmas.

Tomorrow, he'd have to figure out how to exist in a world where Eben wasn't his.

Where Eben had never been his.

Where "temporary" was all he'd ever had.

But tonight—

Tonight, he could lie here.

In the dark.

With the ribbon still on his wrist.

And pretend—just for a moment—that it had been real.

That he'd been enough.

That "this was never supposed to last" had been a lie.

Even though it wasn't.

Even though it never had been.

Even though Noel should have known better than to hope.

---

The ribbon gleamed in the darkness.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a scar.

A reminder of everything he'd lost.

Everything he'd never really had.

Noel stared at it and thought: *Maybe I should have known better than to hope.*

And finally—finally—let himself break.

In the dark.

Alone.

The way he'd always been.

The way he'd always known he would be.

The ribbon still on his wrist.

The only proof that any of it had been real.

Even if only for a moment.

Even if only temporarily.

Even if it had all been a beautiful, devastating mistake.
