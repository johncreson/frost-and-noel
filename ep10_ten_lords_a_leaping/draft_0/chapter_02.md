## Chapter 02: Same Space, Different World

They saw each other at the same time.

Noel was crossing the square, coffee in hand, smile fixed in place.

Eben was near the staging area, clipboard forgotten in his hand.

Their eyes met.

And for a moment—just a moment—everything stopped.

---

**Noel's POV:**

The world narrowed to a single point.

Eben.

Standing twenty feet away. Looking at him with an expression Noel couldn't read.

Noel's heart stuttered. His breath caught. His entire body went very still.

*Say something,* he thought. *Do something.*

But he didn't know what to say.

Didn't know what to do.

Didn't know how to be in the same space as Eben without—

Without everything.

So he did what he always did when he didn't know what else to do.

He smiled.

Nodded.

And kept walking.

---

**Eben's POV:**

Noel was smiling.

That bright, practiced smile that meant absolutely nothing.

The smile that said *I'm fine, everything's fine, don't worry about me.*

Eben knew that smile.

Had seen it a hundred times over the past few weeks.

Had learned to see through it. To see the exhaustion underneath. The fear. The desperate need to be useful.

But now—

Now the smile was back.

And Eben didn't know how to reach past it.

Didn't know if he had the right to try.

So he nodded back.

And watched Noel walk away.

---

The event setup continued around them.

Volunteers hauling equipment. Vendors setting up booths. The usual organized chaos of a Tinsel Town event.

Noel threw himself into it.

Coordinating. Organizing. Fixing problems before they became disasters.

Moving constantly. Smiling constantly. Being useful constantly.

Eben watched from across the square and thought: *He's running.*

*Just like I did.*

*Except he's running while standing still.*

---

They didn't talk.

Not directly.

They communicated through other people.

"Can you tell Eben we need more tables on the east side?"

"Let Noel know the sound system is set up."

"Ask Eben if the donation bins are ready."

"Tell Noel the schedule's been updated."

Working in the same space had never felt so far apart.

---

**Noel's POV:**

He could feel Eben watching him.

Could track his position without looking.

Could sense exactly where he was at any given moment.

It was torture.

Because his body remembered. Remembered what it felt like to be close to Eben. To touch him. To be touched by him.

Remembered the weight of Eben's hand on his back. The warmth of his presence. The way he'd looked at Noel like he was something precious.

And now—

Now there was just distance.

Cold. Deliberate. Unbridgeable.

Noel kept moving. Kept smiling. Kept working.

And tried not to think about how much it hurt.

---

"You okay?"

Wes appeared at his elbow again. Quiet. Concerned.

"Yeah," Noel said automatically. "Just busy."

"You and Eben—"

"We're fine."

"Noel—"

"We're fine, Wes. Just—busy. With the event."

Wes studied him for a long moment. "What happened?"

"Nothing."

"That's not—"

"Nothing happened. We're fine. Everything's fine."

The lie tasted like ash.

Wes didn't believe him. Noel could see it in his eyes.

But Wes didn't push.

Just squeezed his shoulder. "If you need anything—"

"I know. Thanks."

Wes walked away.

And Noel stood there, holding his clipboard, trying to remember how to breathe.

---

**Eben's POV:**

Hugh was watching them.

Not obviously. Hugh was never obvious.

But Eben could see it. The way Hugh's eyes tracked between them. The way he frowned slightly. The way he looked—sad.

"You two okay?" Hugh asked quietly, appearing beside Eben with an armful of garland.

"Fine," Eben said.

"That's not what it looks like."

"We're fine."

"Eben—"

"We're working. That's all."

Hugh's expression shifted. Something knowing. Something disappointed.

"That's all?" he asked quietly.

Eben didn't answer.

Couldn't answer.

Because what was he supposed to say?

*I destroyed the best thing that ever happened to me because I was too scared to keep it?*

*I said the worst possible thing and now he won't even look at me?*

*I don't know how to fix this?*

So he said nothing.

And Hugh sighed. "Okay. But for the record? You're both terrible liars."

He walked away.

And Eben stood there, watching Noel across the square, and thought: *I know.*

---

The morning passed in a blur of coordinated avoidance.

They orbited each other. Never touching. Never speaking directly.

But always—always—aware of exactly where the other was.

It was exhausting.

---

**Dual POV:**

At one point, they ended up on opposite sides of the same table.

Noel was adjusting a display. Eben was checking inventory.

Three feet apart.

Might as well have been miles.

Neither spoke.

Neither looked up.

But the air between them felt electric. Charged. Impossible to ignore.

Noel's hands shook slightly as he straightened a sign.

Eben's jaw was so tight it hurt.

Someone called Noel's name.

He left.

Eben stood there, staring at the empty space where Noel had been, and thought: *This is unbearable.*

---

**Noel's POV:**

The town was watching.

Noel could feel it.

The whispers. The glances. The knowing looks.

Everyone had seen the photos. Had seen them together. Had assumed—

Had assumed they were together.

And now—

Now they were very clearly not together.

And everyone noticed.

Mrs. Chen from the bookshop gave him a sympathetic look.

The Hendersons whispered to each other when he passed.

Even Mayor Kringle looked concerned.

"Everything alright, Noel?" he asked, hovering anxiously.

"Fine," Noel said. Smiled. "Just focused on the event."

"You and Eben—"

"Are working very well together. As always."

The lie was getting easier.

That was the problem.

The lie was always easier than the truth.

---

**Eben's POV:**

Sam was there.

Of course Sam was there.

He appeared beside Eben without warning, carrying lumber like it weighed nothing.

"You look like hell," Sam said conversationally.

"Thanks."

"You're welcome." Sam set down the lumber. Looked at Eben. Really looked. "What did you do?"

"What makes you think I did something?"

"Because Noel looks like he's barely holding it together, and you look like you want to crawl into a hole and die. So. What did you do?"

Eben's throat tightened. "I told him the truth."

"Which truth?"

"That this was never supposed to last."

Sam went very still. "You said that?"

"Yes."

"To his face?"

"Yes."

"Jesus, Eben."

"I know."

"Did you mean it?"

"No."

"Then why did you say it?"

Eben looked away. "Because I was scared."

Sam was quiet for a long moment. Then: "You're an idiot."

"I know."

"You're going to fix this."

"I don't know how."

"You'll figure it out." Sam's voice was hard. Unforgiving. "Because if you don't, I'm going to be very disappointed in you. And trust me—you don't want that."

He walked away.

And Eben stood there, watching Noel across the square, and thought: *I have to fix this.*

*I just don't know how.*

---

The sky was darkening.

Storm clouds rolling in from the north. Heavy. Ominous.

The temperature dropped.

Wind picked up.

Someone called out: "Storm's coming in fast!"

Mayor Kringle looked panicked. "We need to move everything indoors!"

"Where?" someone asked.

Everyone looked around. The community center was booked. The church was too small. The school was closed for the holidays.

Eben heard himself say: "Frost Line Logistics."

Everyone turned to look at him.

"My warehouse," he said. "It's big enough. We can move everything there."

Mayor Kringle looked relieved. "Are you sure?"

"Yeah. It's fine."

It wasn't fine.

Because Noel would be there.

In his space.

In the place Eben had built specifically to keep people out.

And Eben didn't know if he could handle that.

But what choice did he have?

---

**Noel's POV:**

Frost Line Logistics.

Eben's warehouse.

Noel had never been there.

Had never seen Eben's space. His work. The place he'd built.

And now—

Now he was going to spend the afternoon there.

Trapped.

With Eben.

During a storm.

The universe had a terrible sense of humor.

---

They moved the event.

Quickly. Efficiently.

Volunteers hauling equipment. Vendors packing up. Everyone following Eben's truck to the warehouse on the edge of town.

Noel drove in silence.

Hands tight on the wheel.

Trying not to think about what this meant.

Trying not to hope.

Because hope was dangerous.

Hope had teeth.

And Noel had learned—painfully, devastatingly—not to hope for things he couldn't have.

---

The warehouse loomed ahead.

Large. Industrial. Impersonal.

Exactly what Noel would have expected from Eben.

They pulled into the parking lot.

The first drops of rain started to fall.

And Noel sat in his car, staring at the building, and thought: *I can do this.*

*I can get through one afternoon.*

*I can be in the same space as Eben without falling apart.*

The lie felt thin.

Fragile.

But it was all he had.

So he got out of the car.

And walked toward the warehouse.

Toward Eben's space.

Toward whatever came next.
