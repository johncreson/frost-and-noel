## Chapter 05: The Storm Clears

The storm passed as quickly as it had arrived.

One moment, rain pounding against the roof. Thunder rolling. Wind howling.

The next—

Silence.

The kind of heavy, expectant silence that came after chaos.

---

People started gathering their things.

The event was winding down. Donations sorted. Trees distributed. The charity haul a success.

Mayor Kringle was beaming. The vendors were satisfied. The volunteers were cheerful.

Everyone seemed pleased with how it had turned out.

Everyone except the two people who'd made it happen.

---

**Eben's POV:**

Eben stood near the loading dock, watching people leave.

Thanking them. Helping load vehicles. Being professional.

Being empty.

Because Noel's words kept echoing in his head.

*"Not today. Please."*

The way his voice had cracked on "please."

The way he'd looked at Eben—raw and hurt and barely holding it together.

The way he'd walked away without looking back.

Eben had wanted to follow.

Had wanted to push.

Had wanted to say: *I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I love you.*

But he hadn't.

Because Noel had asked him not to.

Had said "please" in that broken voice.

And Eben couldn't—

He couldn't ignore that.

Couldn't push when Noel was barely holding on.

So he'd let him go.

Again.

---

The warehouse was emptying.

People trickling out. Calling goodbyes. Thanking Eben for the space.

He nodded. Smiled. Said the right things.

And felt nothing.

Just—hollow.

Like he'd scooped out everything that mattered and left only the shell.

---

He saw Noel near the exit.

Talking to Wes. Smiling. Looking perfectly fine.

That bright, practiced smile that meant absolutely nothing.

Eben's chest tightened.

Because he knew that smile.

Knew what it cost.

Knew that underneath it, Noel was breaking.

And it was Eben's fault.

---

Noel left without saying goodbye.

Just—walked out.

Got in his car.

Drove away.

Efficient. Mechanical. No hesitation.

Like he couldn't get out of there fast enough.

Eben stood in the doorway and watched him go.

And thought: *I'm losing him.*

*I've already lost him.*

*And I don't know how to get him back.*

---

**Noel's POV:**

Noel made it to his car before his hands started shaking.

Made it out of the parking lot before his vision blurred.

Made it three blocks before he had to pull over.

He sat there, engine running, hands gripping the steering wheel, and tried to breathe.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*You got through it.*

*You didn't break.*

But the lie felt thin.

Fragile.

Like one more thing—one more look, one more word, one more moment—would shatter it completely.

---

Being in Eben's space had been—

Unbearable.

Seeing where he worked. Where he'd built his walls. Where he felt safe.

Seeing how empty it was.

How controlled.

How perfectly designed to keep people out.

And Noel had thought—stupidly, naively—that he'd been different.

That he'd gotten past those walls.

That Eben had let him in.

But he hadn't.

Not really.

Because the second it got real—the second Eben had to choose—he'd chosen the walls.

Chosen the empty warehouse.

Chosen safety over Noel.

---

And that almost-conversation.

That moment in the back shelving.

Just them.

Alone.

Eben trying to say something.

Noel stopping him.

*"Not today. Please."*

His voice had cracked.

He'd heard it crack.

Had felt the mask slip.

Had been so close to breaking right there in front of Eben.

So he'd walked away.

Because what else could he do?

He wasn't ready.

Wasn't ready to hear whatever Eben wanted to say.

Wasn't ready to hope.

Wasn't ready to be hurt again.

---

Noel sat in his car and stared at the ribbon on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a scar.

His fingers moved to untie it.

Stopped.

*Not yet,* he thought. *Not yet.*

Because taking it off would mean accepting that it was over.

Would mean letting go.

Would mean admitting that "temporary" had always been the truth.

And he wasn't ready for that.

Not yet.

Maybe not ever.

---

He took a breath.

Put the car in drive.

And headed home.

To his empty apartment.

To his cold bed.

To the silence that used to feel comfortable and now just felt—

Lonely.

---

**Eben's POV:**

The warehouse was empty.

Everyone gone. Event over. Just Eben and the space he'd built.

The space that had always felt—right.

Organized. Controlled. Safe.

But now—

Now it just felt wrong.

Too quiet.

Too empty.

Too much like exactly what it was.

A place designed to keep people out.

---

Eben walked through the warehouse.

Past the shelving. Past the staging area. Past the spot where he'd stood with Sam.

Past the place where Noel had said "please" in that broken voice.

And he thought: *This is what I chose.*

*This is what I protected.*

*This empty space.*

*These walls.*

*This loneliness.*

---

He'd built this.

All of it.

The systems. The organization. The careful distance.

Had spent years perfecting it.

Making it efficient. Making it safe. Making it impossible for anyone to get close enough to hurt him.

And it had worked.

For years, it had worked.

He'd been safe. Protected. Invulnerable.

And completely, utterly alone.

---

Until Noel.

Noel, who'd walked into his life and made him want things he'd spent years avoiding.

Connection. Vulnerability. Trust.

Love.

Noel, who'd looked at all of Eben's walls and said: *I see you anyway.*

Noel, who'd been patient. Kind. Willing to wait while Eben figured out how to let him in.

Noel, who'd said *I love you* first.

And Eben had destroyed it.

Had taken that gift and thrown it away.

Had chosen fear over love.

Walls over connection.

Safety over everything that mattered.

---

Eben stood in the middle of his empty warehouse and thought: *I can't do this anymore.*

*I can't keep choosing this.*

*I can't keep choosing to be alone.*

Because the alternative—

The alternative was losing Noel.

Was spending the rest of his life in this empty space.

Was never knowing what it felt like to be brave enough to keep something good.

And that—

That was unacceptable.

---

Tomorrow.

Christmas Eve.

He'd fix this.

He'd apologize. Explain. Tell Noel the truth.

*I was scared. I didn't mean it. I love you. I'm choosing you.*

And if Noel said no—

If Noel couldn't forgive him—

Then Eben would live with it.

Would accept the consequence.

Would know that he'd tried.

But he had to try.

Had to fight.

Had to choose Noel over his fear.

Even if it terrified him.

Even if he didn't know how.

Even if he failed.

---

Eben locked up the warehouse.

Got in his truck.

Drove home through the dark streets.

The storm had passed. The sky was clearing. Stars visible through the breaking clouds.

Tomorrow would be Christmas Eve.

The last day of the festival.

The last chance.

And Eben was going to take it.

Was going to choose differently.

Was going to be brave.

Even if it killed him.

---

**Noel's POV:**

Noel's apartment was dark.

Cold.

Empty.

He stood in the doorway and thought: *This is my life.*

*This is what I go back to.*

*This is what I've always had.*

And it had been enough.

Before.

Before Eben.

Before he'd learned what it felt like to not be alone.

Before he'd let himself hope.

Now—

Now it just felt—

Unbearable.

---

He went through the motions.

Shower. Pajamas. Tea he didn't drink.

Sat on the couch. Stared at nothing.

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

He couldn't take it off.

Couldn't let go.

Couldn't accept that it was over.

Even though it was.

Even though Eben had made that clear.

Even though "this was never supposed to last" was the truth.

---

Tomorrow was Christmas Eve.

The last day of the festival.

One more day of pretending.

One more day of smiling.

One more day of being useful.

And then—

And then it would be over.

The festival would end.

The town would go back to normal.

And Noel would go back to—

This.

Empty apartment. Cold bed. Silence.

The way it had always been.

The way it would always be.

---

He looked at the ribbon.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a lie.

And thought: *Maybe I should have known better than to hope.*

*Maybe temporary was always the only thing I was ever going to get.*

*Maybe that's all I'm worth.*

The thought settled in his chest like lead.

Heavy. Suffocating. True.

Because if he'd been worth more—

If he'd been enough—

Eben would have chosen him.

Would have fought for him.

Would have said "I want this to last" instead of "this was never supposed to last."

But he hadn't.

And Noel knew what that meant.

---

He went to bed.

Lay there in the dark.

Stared at the empty side of the bed.

The side where Eben had slept.

Where he'd woken up that one perfect morning and looked at Noel like he was everything.

Before the fear won.

Before the walls went back up.

Before everything broke.

---

Noel closed his eyes.

And thought: *One more day.*

*Just get through one more day.*

*And then it's over.*

The thought should have been comforting.

Should have felt like relief.

Should have felt like the end of something painful.

But it didn't.

It just felt—

Empty.

Like everything else.
