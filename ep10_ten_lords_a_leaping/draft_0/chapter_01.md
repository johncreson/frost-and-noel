## Chapter 01: Morning After Rupture

The storm arrived like a metaphor.

Eben would have appreciated it more if he wasn't standing in the middle of a charity event watching Noel pretend he was fine while clearly not fine.

But that was later.

First, there was the morning.

---

Noel woke up alone.

The bed was cold. Empty. Exactly the way he'd left it when he'd finally dragged himself home last night.

He lay there for a moment, staring at the ceiling, and thought: *This is fine.*

*This is normal.*

*I've done this before.*

The lie tasted familiar. Comfortable, even. Like an old coat he'd worn so many times it had molded to his shape.

He'd been alone before. He'd be alone again. This was just—

This was just how it was.

---

Noel got up.

Shower. Hot enough to hurt. He didn't feel it.

Clothes. The nice ones. The ones that said *I'm fine, everything's fine, nothing to see here.*

Coffee. Black. He didn't taste it.

The apartment was quiet.

Too quiet.

He'd lived here for years. Had always liked the quiet. The space. The sense of having something that was his.

Now it just felt—

Empty.

---

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin. A promise tied in silk.

Except it wasn't a promise.

It was a reminder.

A scar.

Noel's fingers moved to untie it.

Stopped.

He couldn't.

Not yet.

Not when it was the only proof that any of it had been real.

So he left it.

Left the ribbon on his wrist like evidence.

Like a wound he wasn't ready to acknowledge.

---

*This is fine,* Noel thought, staring at his reflection in the bathroom mirror.

The face staring back looked—normal. Functional. Fine.

The smile was practiced. Easy. The kind of smile that said *I'm okay, don't worry about me, I'm always okay.*

Nobody would see through it.

Nobody ever did.

That was the trick, wasn't it? If you performed fine-ness well enough, people believed you. They wanted to believe you. Because if you were fine, they didn't have to worry. Didn't have to ask hard questions. Didn't have to see the parts of you that were breaking.

And Noel had been performing fine-ness his entire life.

He was very good at it.

---

*Useful = worthy.*

That was the equation. The only equation that worked.

So he would be useful.

He would work.

He would show up and smile and coordinate and fix things and make himself indispensable.

And he would not think about last night.

Would not think about Eben's face when he said *this was never supposed to last.*

Would not think about the way his own voice had sounded when he said *okay.*

Flat. Accepting. The sound of someone who'd expected this all along.

Because he had.

Hadn't he?

He'd known it was temporary. Eben had said so from the beginning. Noel had just—

He'd just forgotten.

But he wouldn't make that mistake again.

---

Noel finished his coffee.

Rinsed the mug. Put it in the dishwasher.

Grabbed his coat. His keys. His phone.

Checked the schedule.

Charity tree haul today. Evergreen Square. Setup at nine.

Same space.

Same town.

Same Eben.

His stomach dropped.

He was going to have to see Eben today.

Work beside him. Coordinate with him. Pretend everything was fine.

Pretend his heart wasn't shattered into a thousand pieces.

The thought made him want to crawl back into bed and never leave.

But he couldn't do that.

Because useful people didn't break down. Useful people showed up. Did their jobs. Smiled through the pain.

And Noel was nothing if not useful.

---

He left the apartment.

Locked the door behind him.

Walked to his car through the cold December morning.

The sky was grey. Heavy. Storm clouds building on the horizon.

*Perfect,* Noel thought. *Even the weather's a metaphor.*

He got in the car.

Started the engine.

Sat there for a moment, hands on the wheel, and thought: *I can do this.*

*I can get through one day.*

*I can smile and work and pretend.*

*I've done it before.*

*I can do it again.*

The lie settled in his chest like lead.

But he put the car in drive anyway.

And headed toward Evergreen Square.

Toward the charity event.

Toward Eben.

---

The drive was short.

Too short.

Noel pulled into the parking area and saw the setup already underway.

Vendors. Volunteers. The usual chaos of a Tinsel Town event.

And there—

There, near the main staging area—

Eben.

Noel's heart stuttered.

Eben was talking to someone. Gesturing at a clipboard. Looking calm and collected and completely unaffected.

Like nothing had happened.

Like he hadn't destroyed Noel less than twenty-four hours ago.

Noel's hands tightened on the steering wheel.

*This is fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*Mask on. Smile ready.*

*Nobody gets to see you break.*

He took a breath.

Got out of the car.

And walked toward the event.

Toward Eben.

Toward the performance of a lifetime.

---

The first person to notice him was Wes.

"Morning," Wes said, appearing at his elbow with coffee. Because of course he did. Wes always had coffee.

"Morning," Noel said. His voice sounded normal. Good.

"You okay?"

"Yeah. Why?"

Wes gave him a look. The kind of look that said *I know you're lying but I'm not going to push.*

"No reason," Wes said. "Coffee?"

"Thanks."

Noel took the cup. Sipped it. Didn't taste it.

"Big day today," Wes said.

"Yeah."

"Storm's coming in later. Might have to move things indoors."

"We'll figure it out."

"Yeah." Wes paused. "You sure you're okay?"

"I'm fine."

The lie came easily.

It always did.

Wes studied him for a moment longer. Then nodded. "Okay. Let me know if you need anything."

"Will do."

Wes walked away.

And Noel stood there, holding his coffee, staring at the event setup.

At Eben.

Who still hadn't looked at him.

---

*This is fine,* Noel thought.

*This is normal.*

*I've done this before.*

And he had.

He'd performed fine-ness through breakups and disappointments and heartbreaks before.

This was just—

This was just another one.

Except it wasn't.

Because this was Eben.

And Eben had been—

Eben had been everything.

For a moment.

For a brief, perfect, devastating moment.

And now he was gone.

And Noel was alone.

Again.

The way he'd always been.

The way he'd always known he would be.

---

Noel took a breath.

Put on his smile.

And walked toward the staging area.

Toward the work.

Toward the performance.

Nobody was going to see him break.

Not today.

Not ever.

He was fine.

He was always fine.

Even when he wasn't.

Especially when he wasn't.
