## Chapter 6: The Attempt

**Day 10, Dec 23 — Evening**

**EBEN**

The drive to Noel's apartment took twelve minutes.

Eben spent all twelve of them trying to figure out what to say.

*I'm sorry.*

Too simple. Not enough.

*I didn't mean it.*

True, but not the whole truth.

*I was scared.*

Also true. Still not enough.

*I love you.*

The truest thing.

But would Noel even let him say it?

---

He parked outside Noel's building.

Sat there with the engine off, staring at the window he thought might be Noel's.

The light was on.

Noel was home.

Probably wondering why everyone he trusted eventually decided he wasn't worth staying for.

That thought made Eben's chest hurt.

---

He got out of the truck.

Walked to the building.

Stood in front of the door.

His hand found the box in his pocket. The key.

*You can do this,* he told himself. *You have to do this.*

*Just—say the truth.*

*Say you're sorry.*

*Say you're not running.*

*Say you're choosing him.*

He pressed the buzzer.

---

Static. Then Noel's voice, wary: "Hello?"

"It's me."

Silence.

Long. Heavy. The kind of silence that felt like a door closing.

Then: "What do you want, Eben?"

His voice was flat. Careful. The voice of someone protecting themselves from another blow.

"To talk," Eben said. "Please."

More silence.

"Tonight's not—"

"I know." Eben pressed his forehead against the cold metal of the intercom. "I know it's not a good time. I know I have no right to ask. But I can't—" His voice broke. "I can't wait until tomorrow. I can't let you spend one more night thinking I meant what I said."

The silence stretched.

Then: "What did you mean?"

The question was quiet. Raw.

"That I'm terrified." Eben's breath fogged in the cold air. "That I don't know how to do this. That I've spent my entire life running from anything that might hurt me, and you—" He stopped. Tried again. "You matter. More than anything has ever mattered. And that scared me so much I destroyed it."

Nothing.

He kept going.

"I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'm not asking you to take me back. I'm just—" He pressed his palm against the door. "I'm just asking you to know that I didn't mean it. 'This was never supposed to last' was the biggest lie I've ever told. Because I wanted it to last. I wanted—I want—"

He couldn't finish.

The words stuck in his throat.

---

The intercom crackled.

Noel's voice, barely audible: "Eben."

"Yeah."

"I can't—" A pause. Something that might have been a breath. "I can't do this through an intercom."

Eben's heart stuttered.

"Then let me up."

Silence.

Then: "Not tonight."

The words were quiet. Not angry. Just—tired.

"I hear you," Noel said. "I do. But I can't—I can't process this right now. I can't think straight when you're—when you're here."

"Noel—"

"Tomorrow." His voice cracked slightly. "Can you—can you give me until tomorrow?"

Eben closed his eyes.

Every instinct screamed at him to push. To make Noel hear him. To fix it now, tonight, before another night of distance could make it worse.

But that was the old pattern.

The one that had gotten them here.

*What are you going to choose now?*

"Okay," Eben said quietly. "Tomorrow."

He took a breath.

"I'm not running," he said. "I want you to know that. I'm not taking the January job. I'm not leaving. I'm going to be here. In this town. Whatever happens."

A long pause.

Then: "You deleted the contract?"

"Yes."

Another pause. "When?"

"An hour ago. At the warehouse. Right before I came here."

Silence.

Eben waited.

"Okay," Noel said finally. His voice was strange. Thick. "Tomorrow."

"Tomorrow," Eben agreed.

The intercom clicked off.

---

Eben stood there for another minute.

Staring at the door.

Thinking about Noel on the other side.

Thinking about what he'd almost lost.

What he might still lose.

He pulled the box from his pocket. Opened it. Looked at the key.

Not tonight.

But maybe—

Maybe tomorrow.

He put the box back.

Got in his truck.

Drove home through the dark streets.

Tomorrow was Christmas Eve.

And Eben was going to fight for what mattered.

---

**NOEL**

Noel stood with his back against the door, phone still in his hand, and tried to remember how to breathe.

*I wanted it to last.*

*I want—*

Eben's voice, breaking on words he couldn't finish.

Eben, who never broke.

Eben, who'd deleted the contract.

Eben, who was standing outside his building in the cold, saying things Noel had been desperate to hear.

And Noel had sent him away.

---

His hands were shaking.

His chest hurt.

His eyes burned.

*Why didn't you let him up?*

Because he couldn't think when Eben was close.

Because he didn't trust himself not to forgive everything just to stop the pain.

Because he needed to know if Eben's words were real, and he couldn't know that if he was drowning in Eben's presence.

---

Noel slid down the door.

Sat on the floor.

Pressed his palms against his eyes.

*He said he wanted it to last.*

*He said he was scared.*

*He said he was choosing to stay.*

Were those just words?

Or were they real?

---

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

Frayed. Fragile. Barely holding on.

Just like him.

Noel looked at it.

And thought: *Maybe.*

For the first time in two days, the word didn't feel like a death sentence.

It felt like—

A beginning.

Maybe.
