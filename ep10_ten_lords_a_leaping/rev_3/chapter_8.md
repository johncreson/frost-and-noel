## Chapter 8: Hook Ending

**Day 10, Dec 23 — Late Night**

**NOEL**

(Earlier that evening, before trying to sleep)

The apartment was silent.

Noel stood in the doorway with his keys still in his hand, like he'd forgotten what came next.

This was his life.

Cold air. Quiet rooms. The hum of the fridge pretending it was company.

But something had shifted.

---

Eben's voice echoed in his head.

*"I wanted it to last."*

*"I'm not running."*

*"I deleted the contract."*

Words that might mean everything.

Words that might mean nothing.

Noel wouldn't know until tomorrow.

---

He went to the bedroom and sat on the edge of the mattress.

The empty side stared back at him.

The side where Eben had slept.

Where he'd woken up that one perfect morning and looked at Noel like he was everything.

Before the fear won.

Before the walls went back up.

Before everything broke.

---

His wrist itched.

The ribbon.

Bright red, stupidly cheerful, cutting into skin that didn't deserve to be marked up for a promise that hadn't held.

Noel hooked a nail under the knot.

Pulled.

The bow loosened.

His breath hitched so hard it hurt.

---

He froze with the ends in his fingers, as if letting go would make the whole week evaporate. As if the second it came off, Eben would become a dream Noel had invented to survive December.

But—

But Eben had come here tonight.

Had stood outside in the cold.

Had said things that sounded like the truth.

*"I wanted it to last."*

---

Noel looked at the ribbon.

Really looked at it.

Frayed. Fragile. Barely holding on.

Just like them.

*Maybe,* he'd thought earlier.

*Maybe* was the most dangerous word in the world.

But it was also the only one that felt true.

---

He didn't take the ribbon off.

Not because he was holding onto a lie.

But because—

Because maybe it wasn't a lie.

Because maybe tomorrow would give him answers.

Because maybe—just maybe—Eben had meant every word.

---

Noel curled forward, elbows on his knees, ribbon ends still loose around his wrist.

And in the dark, alone where no one could see, he let himself feel it.

The hope he'd been trying to kill.

The want he'd been trying to bury.

The desperate, terrifying possibility that this wasn't over.

---

One breath.

Then another.

Then the tears that finally found him.

Not the broken, devastated sobs of two nights ago.

Something different.

Something that felt like—

Release.

---

The ribbon stayed.

The hope stayed.

And Noel fell asleep waiting for tomorrow.

Waiting for Christmas Eve.

Waiting to see if Eben would fight for them the way he'd promised.

---

*Tomorrow,* he thought, just before sleep took him.

*Tomorrow, I'll know.*

And for the first time in days, the thought didn't feel like a death sentence.

It felt like a beginning.
