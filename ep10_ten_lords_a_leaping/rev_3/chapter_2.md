## Chapter 2: Same Space, Different World

**Day 10, Dec 23 — Morning**

**NOEL**

They saw each other at the same time.

Noel was crossing the square, coffee in hand, smile fixed in place like armor.

Eben was near the staging area, clipboard in hand, looking like he'd slept fine and felt fine and was generally having a fine morning.

Their eyes met.

And for a moment—just a moment—everything stopped.

---

The world narrowed to a single point.

Eben.

Standing twenty feet away. Looking at him with an expression Noel couldn't read.

Noel's heart stuttered. His breath caught. His entire body went very still.

*Say something,* he thought. *Do something.*

But he didn't know what to say.

So he did what he always did when he didn't know what else to do.

He smiled.

Nodded.

And kept walking.

---

Eben nodded back.

That was it.

No words. No acknowledgment. Just a professional nod between two people who were definitely not dying inside.

Noel made it three more steps before his hands started shaking.

He gripped his coffee tighter.

*Just get through today.*

---

The event setup continued around them.

Volunteers hauling equipment. Vendors setting up booths. The usual organized chaos of a Tinsel Town event.

Noel threw himself into it.

Coordinating. Organizing. Fixing problems before they became disasters.

Moving constantly. Smiling constantly. Being useful constantly.

Because useful people didn't break down.

Useful people showed up. Did their jobs. Smiled through the pain.

---

They didn't talk.

Not directly.

They communicated through other people.

"Can you tell Eben we need more tables on the east side?"

"Let Noel know the sound system is set up."

"Ask Eben if the donation bins are ready."

Same space. Different world.

---

Noel could feel Eben watching him.

Could track his position without looking.

Could sense exactly where he was at any given moment.

It was torture.

Because his body remembered.

Remembered what it felt like to be close to Eben. To touch him. To be touched by him.

And now there was just distance.

Cold. Deliberate. Unbridgeable.

---

"You okay?"

Wes appeared at his elbow again.

"Yeah," Noel said automatically. "Just busy."

"You and Eben—"

"We're fine."

"Noel—"

"We're fine, Wes. Just—busy. With the event."

Wes studied him for a long moment.

Noel kept his smile in place.

"What happened?" Wes asked quietly.

"Nothing."

"That's not—"

"Nothing happened. We're fine. Everything's fine."

Wes didn't believe him. Noel could see it in his eyes.

But Wes didn't push.

Just squeezed his shoulder. "If you need anything—"

"I know. Thanks."

Wes walked away.

---

At one point, they ended up on opposite sides of the same table.

Noel was adjusting a display. Eben was checking inventory.

Three feet apart.

Might as well have been miles.

Neither spoke.

Neither looked up.

But the air between them felt electric. Charged. Impossible to ignore.

Noel's hands shook slightly as he straightened a sign.

He could smell Eben's cologne.

Could feel the space between them like a physical thing.

Someone called Noel's name.

He left.

Walked away without looking back.

---

The town was watching.

Noel could feel it.

The whispers. The glances. The knowing looks.

Everyone had seen the photos. Had seen them together. Had assumed—

Had assumed they were together.

And now they were very clearly not together.

Mrs. Chen from the bookshop gave him a sympathetic look.

Even Mayor Kringle looked concerned.

"Everything alright, Noel?" he asked.

"Fine," Noel said. Smiled. "Just focused on the event."

"You and Eben—"

"Are working very well together. As always."

The lie was getting easier.

That was the problem.

---

The sky was darkening.

Storm clouds rolling in from the north. Heavy. Ominous.

The temperature dropped.

Wind picked up.

Someone called out: "Storm's coming in fast!"

Mayor Kringle looked panicked. "We need to move everything indoors!"

"Where?" someone asked.

Everyone looked around.

The community center was booked. The church was too small. The school was closed for the holidays.

Noel heard Eben's voice: "Frost Line Logistics."

Everyone turned to look at him.

"My warehouse," Eben said. "It's big enough. We can move everything there."

Mayor Kringle looked relieved. "Are you sure?"

"Yeah. It's fine."

Noel's stomach dropped.

Frost Line Logistics.

Eben's warehouse.

Noel had never been there.

Had never seen Eben's space. His work. The place he'd built.

And now—

Now he was going to spend the afternoon there.

Trapped.

With Eben.

During a storm.

The universe had a terrible sense of humor.

---

They moved the event.

Quickly. Efficiently.

Volunteers hauling equipment. Vendors packing up. Everyone following Eben's truck to the warehouse on the edge of town.

Noel drove in silence.

Hands tight on the wheel.

Trying not to think about what this meant.

Trying not to hope.

Because hope was dangerous.

Hope had teeth.

---

The warehouse loomed ahead.

Large. Industrial. Impersonal.

Exactly what Noel would have expected from Eben.

They pulled into the parking lot.

The first drops of rain started to fall.

And Noel sat in his car, staring at the building, and thought: *I can do this.*

*I can get through one afternoon.*

*I can be in the same space as Eben without falling apart.*

The lie felt thin.

Fragile.

But it was all he had.

So he got out of the car.

And walked toward the warehouse.

Toward Eben's space.

Toward whatever came next.
