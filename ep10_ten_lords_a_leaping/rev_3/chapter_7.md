## Chapter 7: The Wait

**Day 10, Dec 23 — Night**

**NOEL**

Eventually, Noel got up from the floor.

Eventually, he moved to the couch.

Eventually, he stopped shaking.

But the questions didn't stop.

---

*Did he mean it?*

*Was it real?*

*Or is this just another version of temporary?*

Noel sat in the dark, knees pulled to his chest, and tried to untangle the mess in his head.

Eben had come to his apartment.

Had stood outside in the cold.

Had said things that sounded like—

Like he meant them.

*I wanted it to last.*

*You matter. More than anything has ever mattered.*

*I deleted the contract.*

---

The contract.

The January job.

The exit strategy Eben had been keeping in his back pocket, just in case.

He'd deleted it.

Before coming here.

Before knowing if Noel would even let him in.

That meant something.

Didn't it?

---

*Or he's just saying what you want to hear.*

The thought was poison.

But it was also—reasonable.

Eben had said "this was never supposed to last" too.

Had looked right at Noel and said the words that had broken everything.

How was Noel supposed to know which version was real?

---

He looked at the ribbon.

Still on his wrist.

Frayed. Fragile.

A reminder of everything that had been and everything that might never be again.

*Tomorrow,* Noel thought.

*I said I'd give him tomorrow.*

The thought felt heavy.

Terrifying.

But also—

Maybe—

A little bit like hope.

---

**EBEN**

Eben didn't sleep.

Couldn't sleep.

Just lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying the conversation.

---

*"I can't process this right now."*

*"Can you give me until tomorrow?"*

*"Tomorrow."*

Noel had heard him.

Had listened.

Had asked for time instead of telling him to leave forever.

That was something.

Right?

---

Eben pulled the key box from his jacket pocket.

Opened it.

The key gleamed in the dim light.

He'd been carrying it for weeks.

Through all the fear.

Through the terrible words.

Through the destruction of everything that mattered.

And he was still holding onto it.

Because some part of him had always known.

Had always hoped.

Had always believed that maybe—

Maybe Noel was worth being brave for.

---

*Tomorrow.*

Christmas Eve.

The last day of the festival.

The day Eben was going to fight for what he wanted.

---

He thought about what Sam had said.

*"Noel deserves someone who fights for him. Someone who chooses him. Even when it's scary."*

Eben had been choosing fear his entire life.

Had been running from anything that might hurt him.

And it had cost him everything.

But tomorrow—

Tomorrow, he was going to choose differently.

Tomorrow, he was going to be brave.

Even if it killed him.

---

He closed the box.

Put it on the nightstand.

And stared at the ceiling.

Waiting for morning.

Waiting for his chance.

Waiting to see if any of this could be saved.

---

**NOEL**

The night stretched on.

Noel dozed. Woke. Dozed again.

Dreams slipping through his fingers like water.

---

In one dream, Eben was standing outside the warehouse.

Holding a key.

Saying: *"You're welcome here. Always."*

In another dream, Eben was leaving.

Getting in his truck.

Driving away.

Not looking back.

The dreams tangled together until Noel couldn't tell which one was the nightmare.

---

He woke before dawn.

Lay there in the grey light.

Thinking about today.

Christmas Eve.

The last day of the festival.

The day Eben had asked to talk.

---

*What are you going to say?*

He didn't know.

*What do you want?*

He didn't know that either.

No—that was a lie.

He knew exactly what he wanted.

He wanted Eben.

Wanted it to be real.

Wanted the words from last night to be true.

He just didn't know if he could trust them.

---

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

Noel touched it gently.

The frayed edge.

The bright red silk.

The proof that something had been real, even if only for a moment.

*Tomorrow,* he'd said.

And tomorrow was here.

---

He got up.

Showered.

Dressed.

Went through the motions.

And tried not to think about what the day might bring.

But his heart was already racing.

And somewhere underneath all the fear—

Underneath all the doubt—

There was something else.

Something that felt dangerously close to hope.
