## Chapter 3: The Storm Arrives

**Day 10, Dec 23 — Afternoon**

**EBEN**

Frost Line Logistics was not designed for emotional confrontations.

It was designed for pallets and shipping manifests and the kind of organized efficiency that made Eben's brain happy.

Clean lines. Clear systems. Everything in its place.

No mess. No chaos. No feelings.

And yet.

---

The warehouse was massive.

High ceilings. Industrial lighting. Rows of shelving stretching toward the back.

It smelled like cardboard and metal and cold air.

Impersonal. Functional. Empty.

Exactly like Eben pretended to be.

---

People flooded in as the rain started in earnest.

Volunteers. Vendors. Equipment. Donations.

The organized chaos of the charity event transplanted into Eben's carefully controlled space.

He directed traffic. Pointed people toward open areas. Helped unload.

And tried very hard not to watch Noel.

Failed.

Because Noel was here.

In his space.

The place Eben had built specifically to keep the world out.

---

Eben's hand drifted to his jacket pocket. Inside: a small box. A key.

The key to this warehouse.

He'd had it made for Noel weeks ago. Had been planning to give it Christmas morning. Had been planning to say: *You're welcome here. Always. This is your space too.*

Then he'd panicked. Said the opposite.

The key had stayed in his pocket ever since. He couldn't throw it away. Couldn't give it away. Could only carry it like a reminder of what he'd destroyed.

---

Noel stood near the entrance, looking around.

Taking in the space. The organization. The complete lack of personal touches.

No photos. No decorations. No evidence that a human being actually worked here.

Just—systems. Efficiency. Control.

Eben watched him look and thought: *This is who I am.*

*This is what I built.*

*Empty. Organized. Alone.*

And for the first time, it felt—

Wrong.

---

The event setup continued.

Tables arranged. Donation bins organized. The charity tree haul transformed into an indoor operation.

Mayor Kringle was relieved. The vendors were adaptable. The volunteers were cheerful.

Everyone seemed fine with the change.

Except Eben.

Who stood in the middle of his warehouse, surrounded by people, and felt more alone than he had in years.

---

"Eben."

Sam's voice. Quiet. Deliberate.

Eben turned.

Sam was standing near the back shelving, arms crossed, expression unreadable.

"Can I talk to you for a minute?"

It wasn't really a question.

"Yeah," Eben said. "Sure."

They walked toward the back of the warehouse. Away from the crowd. Into the quiet space between the shelves.

Sam didn't waste time.

"You're doing that thing you do," he said.

Eben's hand tightened around the box in his pocket. "What thing."

"The thing where you ruin everything before it can ruin you."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Had no idea what to say.

Sam waited.

Patient. Implacable. The way he always was when he'd decided to say something that needed saying.

"I don't—" Eben started.

"Yes, you do." Sam's voice was calm. Matter-of-fact. "I've known you for five years, Eben. I've watched you do this with jobs. With friendships. With anything that gets too close."

"That's not—"

"It is." Sam's eyes were steady. Unflinching. "You find something good. Something that matters. And the second it starts to feel real—the second you start to need it—you destroy it."

Eben's throat closed.

Because Sam was right.

Sam was always right.

---

"I was scared," Eben admitted.

"So you ran."

"Yes."

"While standing still."

Eben looked away. "Yes."

---

Sam was quiet for a moment.

Then: "Wes told me you were good for Noel."

Eben's head snapped up.

"He said Noel was different with you," Sam continued. "Lighter. Happier. Like he'd finally found someone who saw him. Really saw him. Not just what he could do for them."

Eben's chest tightened. His hand still gripped the box.

"I believed him," Sam said. "I thought—finally. Someone who gets it. Someone who understands that Noel's worth more than just being useful."

He paused.

"Was he wrong?"

The question hung in the air.

Simple. Devastating.

---

"I don't know," Eben said quietly.

"That's not good enough."

"You hurt him," Sam said.

"I know."

"He's out there right now, pretending he's fine. Smiling at everyone. Being useful. Making sure nobody worries about him." Sam's voice was hard. "And he's breaking. Can you see that?"

The words hit like a gut punch.

"I didn't mean—"

"It doesn't matter what you meant. It matters what you said."

Eben flinched.

"Did you mean it?" Sam asked.

"No."

"Then why did you say it?"

"Because I was terrified." The admission came out raw. Honest. "Because it was real. Because I needed him. Because I—" His voice broke. "Because I didn't know how to be that vulnerable."

"So you destroyed it."

"Yes."

"Before it could destroy you."

Eben nodded slowly. His fingers traced the edge of the box in his pocket.

Sam studied him. "That's what I thought."

---

They stood there in silence.

The warehouse hummed around them. Voices. Movement. The sound of the storm outside.

"I have to fix this," Eben said quietly.

"Yes. You do."

"I don't know how."

"You'll figure it out." Sam's voice was firm. "Because the alternative is losing him. And I don't think you can live with that."

Eben looked toward the front of the warehouse.

Toward where Noel was. Somewhere in the crowd. Smiling. Working. Pretending.

"No," Eben said quietly. "I can't."

---

Sam studied him for a long moment.

Then: "Good. Because Noel deserves someone who fights for him. Someone who chooses him. Even when it's scary. Even when it's hard."

"I know."

"What are you going to choose now?"

Eben's hand closed around the box. The key.

The thing he'd been carrying for weeks.

Waiting for the right moment.

Waiting to be brave enough.

"I'm going to choose him," Eben said. "Tonight. Not tomorrow. Tonight."

Sam nodded slowly. "Good."

He walked away.

And Eben stood there, alone between the shelves, and thought: *Tonight.*

*I have to try tonight.*

---

As if sensing his gaze, Noel looked up from across the warehouse.

Their eyes met.

For a moment, everything stopped.

Noel's smile faltered. Just slightly. Just enough for Eben to see the hurt underneath.

Then someone called Noel's name.

He turned away.

And Eben stood there, in the middle of his empty warehouse, surrounded by people, and thought: *I did this.*

*I broke him.*

*And I have to fix it.*

*Today.*
