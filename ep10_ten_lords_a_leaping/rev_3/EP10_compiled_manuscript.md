## Chapter 1: Morning After Rupture

**Day 10, Dec 23 â€” Morning**

**NOEL**

The bed was cold.

This was not news. Noel had been sleeping alone for years before Eben. He knew how to do this. He was very good at being alone.

He was handling it fine.

This was a lie, but it was a devastated lie, which was less festive than usual but still counted.

---

Noel stared at the ceiling and cataloged the situation.

One: He was awake. Technically. His eyes were open. That was close enough.

Two: It was morning. Probably. The light coming through the window suggested daylight, though it could also be the apocalypse. Hard to tell.

Three: Eben was gone.

Not gone as in *left the bed to make coffee*. Gone as in *never coming back because he'd said "this was never supposed to last" and Noel had said "okay" like a functioning person who definitely wasn't dying inside.*

So. Fine.

Everything was fine.

---

Shower. Hot enough to hurt.

Noel stood under the spray and tried to feel something. Anything. The water was scalding. His skin turned red. He registered this information the way someone might register the weather in a country they'd never visit.

Distantly.

Academically.

Not at all.

---

Clothes next.

The nice ones. The ones that said *I'm a professional adult human doing professional adult human things.*

Noel pulled on pants. Buttoned a shirt. Located socks that matched. This was called *functioning*. He was very good at it.

His hands only shook a little.

He left the ribbon on his wrist.

Didn't look at it.

Couldn't take it off.

The bright red silk sat against his skin like evidence. Like a scar. Like the only proof that any of it had been real.

---

Coffee.

Black. Because adding milk required decision-making, and Noel's brain had approximately three functional neurons left, all of which were currently occupied with the critical task of *not screaming.*

He sat at his kitchen table.

Drank the coffee.

Didn't taste it.

The apartment was quiet. Too quiet. The kind of silence that used to feel comfortable and now just felt empty. Wrong. Like someone had scooped out the good parts and left the shell.

---

*Useful = worthy.*

That was the equation. The only equation that worked.

So he would be useful.

He would work. He would coordinate. He would smile and fix problems and make himself indispensable.

And he would not think about last night.

Would not think about Eben's face when he said *this was never supposed to last.*

Would not think about the way his own voice had sounded when he said *okay.*

Flat. Accepting. The sound of someone who'd expected this all along.

Because he had.

Hadn't he?

---

His phone buzzed.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Morning! Big day today! Charity tree haul at Evergreen Square! See you at 9!*

Noel stared at the message.

Right.

The event.

The one he'd been coordinating for weeks. The one that involved vendors and volunteers and approximately ninety-seven moving parts, all of which required his attention.

The one that would also involve Eben.

Same space. Same town. Same man who'd destroyed him less than twenty-four hours ago.

His stomach dropped.

---

Noel stood.

Rinsed his mug. Put it in the dishwasher.

Grabbed his coat. His keys. His phone.

Checked his reflection in the hallway mirror.

The face staring back lookedâ€”normal. Functional. Fine.

The smile was practiced. Easy. The kind of smile that said *I'm okay, don't worry about me, I'm always okay.*

Nobody would see through it.

Nobody ever did.

---

He left the apartment.

Locked the door behind him.

Walked to his car through the cold December morning.

The sky was grey. Heavy. Storm clouds building on the horizon like the universe had decided to provide visual metaphors for his emotional state.

He got in the car.

Started the engine.

Sat there for a moment, hands on the wheel, and thought: *I can do this.*

*I can get through one day.*

The lie settled in his chest like lead.

But he put the car in drive anyway.

---

The drive to Evergreen Square was short.

Too short.

Noel pulled into the parking area and saw the setup already underway.

Vendors. Volunteers. The usual organized chaos of a Tinsel Town event.

And thereâ€”

There, near the main staging areaâ€”

Eben.

Noel's heart stuttered.

Eben was talking to someone. Gesturing at a clipboard. Looking calm and collected and completely unaffected.

Like nothing had happened.

Like he hadn't destroyed Noel less than twenty-four hours ago.

Like this was just another day.

Noel's hands tightened on the steering wheel.

*Mask on. Smile ready.*

*Nobody gets to see you break.*

He took a breath.

Got out of the car.

And walked toward the event.

---

The first person to notice him was Wes.

Of course it was Wes.

Wes had the uncanny ability to materialize exactly when you least wanted him to, bearing coffee and concern in equal measure.

"Morning," Wes said, appearing at his elbow with a to-go cup.

"Morning," Noel said.

His voice sounded normal.

Good.

"You okay?" Wes asked.

The question was gentle. Careful. The kind of careful that meant Wes already knew the answer.

"Yeah," Noel said. "Why?"

Wes gave him a look.

The look said: *I know you're lying but I'm not going to push.*

The look also said: *I'm here when you're ready.*

"No reason," Wes said. "Coffee?"

"Thanks."

Noel took the cup. Sipped it.

Tasted nothing.

"Big day today," Wes said.

"Yeah."

"Storm's coming in later. Might have to move things indoors."

"We'll figure it out."

Wes studied him for a moment longer. Then nodded. "Okay. Let me know if you need anything."

"Will do."

Wes walked away.

And Noel stood there, holding his coffee, staring at the event setup.

At Eben.

Who still hadn't looked at him.

---

Noel took a breath.

Put on his smile.

And walked toward the staging area.

Toward the work.

Toward the performance.

He was handling it fine.

He was always fine.

Even when he wasn't.

Especially when he wasn't.


---

## Chapter 2: Same Space, Different World

**Day 10, Dec 23 â€” Morning**

**NOEL**

They saw each other at the same time.

Noel was crossing the square, coffee in hand, smile fixed in place like armor.

Eben was near the staging area, clipboard in hand, looking like he'd slept fine and felt fine and was generally having a fine morning.

Their eyes met.

And for a momentâ€”just a momentâ€”everything stopped.

---

The world narrowed to a single point.

Eben.

Standing twenty feet away. Looking at him with an expression Noel couldn't read.

Noel's heart stuttered. His breath caught. His entire body went very still.

*Say something,* he thought. *Do something.*

But he didn't know what to say.

So he did what he always did when he didn't know what else to do.

He smiled.

Nodded.

And kept walking.

---

Eben nodded back.

That was it.

No words. No acknowledgment. Just a professional nod between two people who were definitely not dying inside.

Noel made it three more steps before his hands started shaking.

He gripped his coffee tighter.

*Just get through today.*

---

The event setup continued around them.

Volunteers hauling equipment. Vendors setting up booths. The usual organized chaos of a Tinsel Town event.

Noel threw himself into it.

Coordinating. Organizing. Fixing problems before they became disasters.

Moving constantly. Smiling constantly. Being useful constantly.

Because useful people didn't break down.

Useful people showed up. Did their jobs. Smiled through the pain.

---

They didn't talk.

Not directly.

They communicated through other people.

"Can you tell Eben we need more tables on the east side?"

"Let Noel know the sound system is set up."

"Ask Eben if the donation bins are ready."

Same space. Different world.

---

Noel could feel Eben watching him.

Could track his position without looking.

Could sense exactly where he was at any given moment.

It was torture.

Because his body remembered.

Remembered what it felt like to be close to Eben. To touch him. To be touched by him.

And now there was just distance.

Cold. Deliberate. Unbridgeable.

---

"You okay?"

Wes appeared at his elbow again.

"Yeah," Noel said automatically. "Just busy."

"You and Ebenâ€”"

"We're fine."

"Noelâ€”"

"We're fine, Wes. Justâ€”busy. With the event."

Wes studied him for a long moment.

Noel kept his smile in place.

"What happened?" Wes asked quietly.

"Nothing."

"That's notâ€”"

"Nothing happened. We're fine. Everything's fine."

Wes didn't believe him. Noel could see it in his eyes.

But Wes didn't push.

Just squeezed his shoulder. "If you need anythingâ€”"

"I know. Thanks."

Wes walked away.

---

At one point, they ended up on opposite sides of the same table.

Noel was adjusting a display. Eben was checking inventory.

Three feet apart.

Might as well have been miles.

Neither spoke.

Neither looked up.

But the air between them felt electric. Charged. Impossible to ignore.

Noel's hands shook slightly as he straightened a sign.

He could smell Eben's cologne.

Could feel the space between them like a physical thing.

Someone called Noel's name.

He left.

Walked away without looking back.

---

The town was watching.

Noel could feel it.

The whispers. The glances. The knowing looks.

Everyone had seen the photos. Had seen them together. Had assumedâ€”

Had assumed they were together.

And now they were very clearly not together.

Mrs. Chen from the bookshop gave him a sympathetic look.

Even Mayor Kringle looked concerned.

"Everything alright, Noel?" he asked.

"Fine," Noel said. Smiled. "Just focused on the event."

"You and Ebenâ€”"

"Are working very well together. As always."

The lie was getting easier.

That was the problem.

---

The sky was darkening.

Storm clouds rolling in from the north. Heavy. Ominous.

The temperature dropped.

Wind picked up.

Someone called out: "Storm's coming in fast!"

Mayor Kringle looked panicked. "We need to move everything indoors!"

"Where?" someone asked.

Everyone looked around.

The community center was booked. The church was too small. The school was closed for the holidays.

Noel heard Eben's voice: "Frost Line Logistics."

Everyone turned to look at him.

"My warehouse," Eben said. "It's big enough. We can move everything there."

Mayor Kringle looked relieved. "Are you sure?"

"Yeah. It's fine."

Noel's stomach dropped.

Frost Line Logistics.

Eben's warehouse.

Noel had never been there.

Had never seen Eben's space. His work. The place he'd built.

And nowâ€”

Now he was going to spend the afternoon there.

Trapped.

With Eben.

During a storm.

The universe had a terrible sense of humor.

---

They moved the event.

Quickly. Efficiently.

Volunteers hauling equipment. Vendors packing up. Everyone following Eben's truck to the warehouse on the edge of town.

Noel drove in silence.

Hands tight on the wheel.

Trying not to think about what this meant.

Trying not to hope.

Because hope was dangerous.

Hope had teeth.

---

The warehouse loomed ahead.

Large. Industrial. Impersonal.

Exactly what Noel would have expected from Eben.

They pulled into the parking lot.

The first drops of rain started to fall.

And Noel sat in his car, staring at the building, and thought: *I can do this.*

*I can get through one afternoon.*

*I can be in the same space as Eben without falling apart.*

The lie felt thin.

Fragile.

But it was all he had.

So he got out of the car.

And walked toward the warehouse.

Toward Eben's space.

Toward whatever came next.


---

## Chapter 3: The Storm Arrives

**Day 10, Dec 23 â€” Afternoon**

**EBEN**

Frost Line Logistics was not designed for emotional confrontations.

It was designed for pallets and shipping manifests and the kind of organized efficiency that made Eben's brain happy.

Clean lines. Clear systems. Everything in its place.

No mess. No chaos. No feelings.

And yet.

---

The warehouse was massive.

High ceilings. Industrial lighting. Rows of shelving stretching toward the back.

It smelled like cardboard and metal and cold air.

Impersonal. Functional. Empty.

Exactly like Eben pretended to be.

---

People flooded in as the rain started in earnest.

Volunteers. Vendors. Equipment. Donations.

The organized chaos of the charity event transplanted into Eben's carefully controlled space.

He directed traffic. Pointed people toward open areas. Helped unload.

And tried very hard not to watch Noel.

Failed.

Because Noel was here.

In his space.

The place Eben had built specifically to keep the world out.

---

Eben's hand drifted to his jacket pocket. Inside: a small box. A key.

The key to this warehouse.

He'd had it made for Noel weeks ago. Had been planning to give it Christmas morning. Had been planning to say: *You're welcome here. Always. This is your space too.*

Then he'd panicked. Said the opposite.

The key had stayed in his pocket ever since. He couldn't throw it away. Couldn't give it away. Could only carry it like a reminder of what he'd destroyed.

---

Noel stood near the entrance, looking around.

Taking in the space. The organization. The complete lack of personal touches.

No photos. No decorations. No evidence that a human being actually worked here.

Justâ€”systems. Efficiency. Control.

Eben watched him look and thought: *This is who I am.*

*This is what I built.*

*Empty. Organized. Alone.*

And for the first time, it feltâ€”

Wrong.

---

The event setup continued.

Tables arranged. Donation bins organized. The charity tree haul transformed into an indoor operation.

Mayor Kringle was relieved. The vendors were adaptable. The volunteers were cheerful.

Everyone seemed fine with the change.

Except Eben.

Who stood in the middle of his warehouse, surrounded by people, and felt more alone than he had in years.

---

"Eben."

Sam's voice. Quiet. Deliberate.

Eben turned.

Sam was standing near the back shelving, arms crossed, expression unreadable.

"Can I talk to you for a minute?"

It wasn't really a question.

"Yeah," Eben said. "Sure."

They walked toward the back of the warehouse. Away from the crowd. Into the quiet space between the shelves.

Sam didn't waste time.

"You're doing that thing you do," he said.

Eben's hand tightened around the box in his pocket. "What thing."

"The thing where you ruin everything before it can ruin you."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Had no idea what to say.

Sam waited.

Patient. Implacable. The way he always was when he'd decided to say something that needed saying.

"I don'tâ€”" Eben started.

"Yes, you do." Sam's voice was calm. Matter-of-fact. "I've known you for five years, Eben. I've watched you do this with jobs. With friendships. With anything that gets too close."

"That's notâ€”"

"It is." Sam's eyes were steady. Unflinching. "You find something good. Something that matters. And the second it starts to feel realâ€”the second you start to need itâ€”you destroy it."

Eben's throat closed.

Because Sam was right.

Sam was always right.

---

"I was scared," Eben admitted.

"So you ran."

"Yes."

"While standing still."

Eben looked away. "Yes."

---

Sam was quiet for a moment.

Then: "Wes told me you were good for Noel."

Eben's head snapped up.

"He said Noel was different with you," Sam continued. "Lighter. Happier. Like he'd finally found someone who saw him. Really saw him. Not just what he could do for them."

Eben's chest tightened. His hand still gripped the box.

"I believed him," Sam said. "I thoughtâ€”finally. Someone who gets it. Someone who understands that Noel's worth more than just being useful."

He paused.

"Was he wrong?"

The question hung in the air.

Simple. Devastating.

---

"I don't know," Eben said quietly.

"That's not good enough."

"You hurt him," Sam said.

"I know."

"He's out there right now, pretending he's fine. Smiling at everyone. Being useful. Making sure nobody worries about him." Sam's voice was hard. "And he's breaking. Can you see that?"

The words hit like a gut punch.

"I didn't meanâ€”"

"It doesn't matter what you meant. It matters what you said."

Eben flinched.

"Did you mean it?" Sam asked.

"No."

"Then why did you say it?"

"Because I was terrified." The admission came out raw. Honest. "Because it was real. Because I needed him. Because Iâ€”" His voice broke. "Because I didn't know how to be that vulnerable."

"So you destroyed it."

"Yes."

"Before it could destroy you."

Eben nodded slowly. His fingers traced the edge of the box in his pocket.

Sam studied him. "That's what I thought."

---

They stood there in silence.

The warehouse hummed around them. Voices. Movement. The sound of the storm outside.

"I have to fix this," Eben said quietly.

"Yes. You do."

"I don't know how."

"You'll figure it out." Sam's voice was firm. "Because the alternative is losing him. And I don't think you can live with that."

Eben looked toward the front of the warehouse.

Toward where Noel was. Somewhere in the crowd. Smiling. Working. Pretending.

"No," Eben said quietly. "I can't."

---

Sam studied him for a long moment.

Then: "Good. Because Noel deserves someone who fights for him. Someone who chooses him. Even when it's scary. Even when it's hard."

"I know."

"What are you going to choose now?"

Eben's hand closed around the box. The key.

The thing he'd been carrying for weeks.

Waiting for the right moment.

Waiting to be brave enough.

"I'm going to choose him," Eben said. "Tonight. Not tomorrow. Tonight."

Sam nodded slowly. "Good."

He walked away.

And Eben stood there, alone between the shelves, and thought: *Tonight.*

*I have to try tonight.*

---

As if sensing his gaze, Noel looked up from across the warehouse.

Their eyes met.

For a moment, everything stopped.

Noel's smile faltered. Just slightly. Just enough for Eben to see the hurt underneath.

Then someone called Noel's name.

He turned away.

And Eben stood there, in the middle of his empty warehouse, surrounded by people, and thought: *I did this.*

*I broke him.*

*And I have to fix it.*

*Today.*


---

## Chapter 4: The Yearning

**Day 10, Dec 23 â€” Afternoon**

**NOEL**

Noel had never been to Frost Line Logistics before.

Had never seen Eben's space. His work. The place he'd built.

And now he was here.

Standing in the middle of it.

Surrounded by Eben's careful organization. His systems. His control.

It felt devastating.

---

The warehouse was exactly what Noel would have expected.

Clean. Organized. Efficient.

Everything labeled. Everything in its place. Everything controlled.

No personal touches. No photos. No evidence that a human being actually worked here.

Justâ€”systems.

Like Eben had built a space that perfectly reflected who he pretended to be.

Cold. Distant. Untouchable.

Except Noel knew better.

Knew that underneath all that control was someone who felt everything.

Who was terrified of feeling everything.

Who'd rather destroy something beautiful than risk being hurt by it.

---

The event had settled into the space.

Tables set up. Donation bins organized. People browsing. Volunteers helping.

The charity tree haul, transplanted indoors.

It was working.

Everyone seemed fine with it.

Except Noel.

Who stood near the far wall, holding a clipboard he wasn't reading, and tried not to think about where he was.

---

He moved through the afternoon on autopilot.

Helping vendors. Organizing donations. Answering questions.

Smiling. Always smiling.

The performance of fine-ness.

---

At one point, he was sorting donation bins near the coffee station.

A volunteer had mislabeled oneâ€”"Winter Clothes" written on a box of kitchen supplies.

"Hey, Noel?" The volunteer looked embarrassed. "I think I mixed these up."

"No problem," Noel said, reaching for the label. "Easy fix."

But his hand slipped. The marker fell. Rolled under the table.

He bent to retrieve it, and the ribbon on his wrist caught on the table edge.

Snagged.

Pulled tight.

The silk thread frayed slightly.

Noel froze.

His breath stopped. His heart stuttered.

The ribbon was tearing.

Just a little. Just enough to notice.

He carefully unhooked it, fingers trembling.

When he looked up, Eben was across the room.

Watching.

Their eyes met.

Eben's expression shifted. Something raw flickering there.

Then someone called Eben's name, and he turned away.

And Noel stood there, holding the marker, staring at the frayed edge of the ribbon.

*Don't hope,* he told himself. *Don't you dare hope.*

---

Later, he watched Eben help an elderly vendor carry a heavy box.

Watched him crouch down to fix a little girl's mitten when it fell off.

Watched him quietly redirect a confused volunteer with patience and kindness.

Small things.

Quiet things.

The kind of things that made Noel's chest ache.

Because that was Eben.

The real Eben.

The one who cared so much he had to build walls to survive it.

---

He found himself near the back shelving at one point.

Away from the crowd. Away from the noise.

Justâ€”standing there.

In the quiet space between the rows.

---

"Noel."

Eben's voice.

Quiet. Careful.

Noel's entire body went rigid.

He turned.

Eben was standing a few feet away. Hands in his pockets. Expression unreadable.

They were alone.

Hidden by the shelving. Away from the crowd.

Just them.

In Eben's space.

In the quiet.

---

Noel's heart was pounding so hard it hurt.

"Eben," he said. His voice sounded normal. Good.

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Seemed to be struggling with something.

"Iâ€”" he started.

Noel's chest tightened.

*Don't,* he thought. *Please don't.*

*I can't do this.*

*Not today.*

"Don't," Noel said quietly.

Eben stopped.

"I need toâ€”" Eben tried again.

"Not today." Noel's voice cracked. "Please."

The word came out broken.

Raw.

Honest in a way Noel hadn't meant it to be.

---

Eben went very still.

Something shifted in his expression. Pain. Understanding. Regret.

"Okay," he said quietly.

He didn't move.

Didn't leave.

Just stood there, looking at Noel like he was something precious and broken and Eben didn't know how to fix it.

Noel couldn't handle it.

Couldn't handle the way Eben was looking at him.

Couldn't handle being this close.

---

"I have to go," Noel said.

He walked away.

Didn't look back.

Because if he looked backâ€”

If he saw Eben's faceâ€”

He might break.

And he couldn't break.

Not here.

Not in front of everyone.

---

Noel made it to the front of the warehouse.

Found a quiet corner.

Pressed his back against the wall.

And tried to breathe.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*Just get through the rest of the day.*

But his hands were shaking.

And his chest was too tight.

And he could still feel Eben's presence.

Could still see the way he'd looked at Noel.

Like he wanted to say something.

Like he wanted to fix this.

Like he didn't know how.

---

The storm continued outside.

The event continued inside.

And Noel stood in the corner of Eben's warehouse, surrounded by people, and felt more alone than he'd ever felt in his life.

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin.

The frayed edge catching the light.

A promise that had become a lie.

---

Someone called his name.

Noel took a breath.

Put on his smile.

And went back to work.

Back to being useful.

Back to pretending he was fine.

Because that's what he did.

That's what he'd always done.


---

## Chapter 5: The Storm Clears

**Day 10, Dec 23 â€” Late Afternoon**

**EBEN**

The storm passed as quickly as it had arrived.

One moment, rain pounding against the roof. Thunder rolling. Wind howling.

The nextâ€”

Silence.

The kind of heavy, expectant silence that came after chaos.

---

People started gathering their things.

The event was winding down. Donations sorted. Trees distributed. The charity haul a success.

Mayor Kringle was beaming. The vendors were satisfied. The volunteers were cheerful.

Everyone seemed pleased with how it had turned out.

Everyone except the two people who'd made it happen.

---

Eben stood near the loading dock, watching people leave.

Thanking them. Helping load vehicles. Being professional.

Being empty.

Because Noel's words kept echoing in his head.

*"Not today. Please."*

The way his voice had cracked on "please."

The way he'd walked away without looking back.

---

He saw Noel near the exit.

Talking to someone. Smiling. Looking perfectly fine.

That bright, practiced smile that meant absolutely nothing.

Eben's chest tightened.

Because he knew that smile.

Knew what it cost.

And it was Eben's fault.

---

His hand found the box in his pocket again.

The key.

He'd been carrying it for weeks. Had been so sure of what he wanted.

And then fear had taken over.

Fear that felt so familiar it was almost comfortable.

The pattern he'd run his entire life.

---

*"You're destroying something before it can hurt you."*

Sam's words. Simple. Devastating. True.

Eben stood in his warehouseâ€”the space he'd built to keep people outâ€”and saw it for what it was.

A monument to fear.

A shrine to loneliness.

A prison he'd chosen because it felt safer than being loved.

---

His phone buzzed in his pocket.

The contract email. The January job. The exit he'd been keeping as backup.

Just in case.

Just in case it got too hard.

Just in case he needed to run.

Eben pulled out his phone.

Opened the email.

Read it one more time.

*Three months out of state. Good money. Clean exit.*

The old Eben would have taken it. Would have been on a plane by New Year's, leaving before anyone could leave him.

But the old Eben hadn't known what it felt like to hold Noel.

Hadn't known what it felt like to be seen.

Hadn't known that some things were worth staying for.

---

Eben typed: *Thank you for the opportunity. I'm no longer available for January. I've decided to stay local.*

Read it twice.

Hit send.

The message disappeared.

---

He stood there for a moment, phone in hand, and felt something shift.

The exit was gone. The escape hatch closed.

He was committed now.

To this town.

To whatever came next.

To trying.

Even if Noel said no.

---

**NOEL**

Noel was almost to the exit when he saw Eben standing by the loading dock.

Phone in hand. Expressionâ€”

Intense.

Focused.

Like he was making a decision.

Noel looked away.

Kept walking.

Because whatever Eben was doing, it wasn't Noel's business anymore.

---

He made it to his car before his hands started shaking.

Made it out of the parking lot before his vision blurred.

Made it three blocks before he had to pull over.

He sat there, engine running, hands gripping the steering wheel, and tried to breathe.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*You got through it.*

*You didn't break.*

But the lie felt thin.

Fragile.

Like one more thingâ€”one more look, one more word, one more momentâ€”would shatter it completely.

---

His phone was in his hand.

He didn't remember picking it up.

But there it was.

Eben's contact on the screen.

His thumb hovered over the call button.

*Just call him,* part of him whispered. *Just ask.*

No.

He couldn't.

Couldn't risk hearing it again.

Noel deleted the half-typed text he didn't remember starting.

Put the phone down.

*Not yet,* he thought. *Not yet.*

---

He took a breath.

Put the car in drive.

And headed home.

To his empty apartment.

To his cold bed.

To the silence that used to feel comfortable and now just felt lonely.

---

**EBEN**

The warehouse was nearly empty now.

Just a few stragglers finishing cleanup.

Eben walked through the space slowly.

Past the shelving. Past the staging area. Past the spot where he'd stood with Sam.

Past the place where Noel had said "please" in that broken voice.

And then he saw it.

On the floor near the back shelving.

A pen.

Noel's pen.

The one he'd been using on his clipboard all afternoon. Blue ink. Slightly chewed cap.

Eben picked it up.

Turned it over in his hands.

Such a small thing.

Ordinary. Insignificant.

But it was Noel's.

And it was here.

In Eben's space.

Proof that he'd been here.

That this had been real.

---

Eben stood there, holding the pen in one hand, the key in his pocket, and thought: *Tonight.*

*Not tomorrow.*

*Tonight.*

He'd already waited too long.

Had already let fear win too many times.

If he waited until tomorrowâ€”until it was convenient, until he was ready, until the excuse felt rightâ€”he might never do it.

He might run again.

And he couldn't run from this.

---

He pocketed the pen.

Locked up the warehouse.

Got in his truck.

But he didn't go home.

He went to Noel's apartment.


---

## Chapter 6: The Attempt

**Day 10, Dec 23 â€” Evening**

**EBEN**

The drive to Noel's apartment took twelve minutes.

Eben spent all twelve of them trying to figure out what to say.

*I'm sorry.*

Too simple. Not enough.

*I didn't mean it.*

True, but not the whole truth.

*I was scared.*

Also true. Still not enough.

*I love you.*

The truest thing.

But would Noel even let him say it?

---

He parked outside Noel's building.

Sat there with the engine off, staring at the window he thought might be Noel's.

The light was on.

Noel was home.

Probably wondering why everyone he trusted eventually decided he wasn't worth staying for.

That thought made Eben's chest hurt.

---

He got out of the truck.

Walked to the building.

Stood in front of the door.

His hand found the box in his pocket. The key.

*You can do this,* he told himself. *You have to do this.*

*Justâ€”say the truth.*

*Say you're sorry.*

*Say you're not running.*

*Say you're choosing him.*

He pressed the buzzer.

---

Static. Then Noel's voice, wary: "Hello?"

"It's me."

Silence.

Long. Heavy. The kind of silence that felt like a door closing.

Then: "What do you want, Eben?"

His voice was flat. Careful. The voice of someone protecting themselves from another blow.

"To talk," Eben said. "Please."

More silence.

"Tonight's notâ€”"

"I know." Eben pressed his forehead against the cold metal of the intercom. "I know it's not a good time. I know I have no right to ask. But I can'tâ€”" His voice broke. "I can't wait until tomorrow. I can't let you spend one more night thinking I meant what I said."

The silence stretched.

Then: "What did you mean?"

The question was quiet. Raw.

"That I'm terrified." Eben's breath fogged in the cold air. "That I don't know how to do this. That I've spent my entire life running from anything that might hurt me, and youâ€”" He stopped. Tried again. "You matter. More than anything has ever mattered. And that scared me so much I destroyed it."

Nothing.

He kept going.

"I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'm not asking you to take me back. I'm justâ€”" He pressed his palm against the door. "I'm just asking you to know that I didn't mean it. 'This was never supposed to last' was the biggest lie I've ever told. Because I wanted it to last. I wantedâ€”I wantâ€”"

He couldn't finish.

The words stuck in his throat.

---

The intercom crackled.

Noel's voice, barely audible: "Eben."

"Yeah."

"I can'tâ€”" A pause. Something that might have been a breath. "I can't do this through an intercom."

Eben's heart stuttered.

"Then let me up."

Silence.

Then: "Not tonight."

The words were quiet. Not angry. Justâ€”tired.

"I hear you," Noel said. "I do. But I can'tâ€”I can't process this right now. I can't think straight when you'reâ€”when you're here."

"Noelâ€”"

"Tomorrow." His voice cracked slightly. "Can youâ€”can you give me until tomorrow?"

Eben closed his eyes.

Every instinct screamed at him to push. To make Noel hear him. To fix it now, tonight, before another night of distance could make it worse.

But that was the old pattern.

The one that had gotten them here.

*What are you going to choose now?*

"Okay," Eben said quietly. "Tomorrow."

He took a breath.

"I'm not running," he said. "I want you to know that. I'm not taking the January job. I'm not leaving. I'm going to be here. In this town. Whatever happens."

A long pause.

Then: "You deleted the contract?"

"Yes."

Another pause. "When?"

"An hour ago. At the warehouse. Right before I came here."

Silence.

Eben waited.

"Okay," Noel said finally. His voice was strange. Thick. "Tomorrow."

"Tomorrow," Eben agreed.

The intercom clicked off.

---

Eben stood there for another minute.

Staring at the door.

Thinking about Noel on the other side.

Thinking about what he'd almost lost.

What he might still lose.

He pulled the box from his pocket. Opened it. Looked at the key.

Not tonight.

But maybeâ€”

Maybe tomorrow.

He put the box back.

Got in his truck.

Drove home through the dark streets.

Tomorrow was Christmas Eve.

And Eben was going to fight for what mattered.

---

**NOEL**

Noel stood with his back against the door, phone still in his hand, and tried to remember how to breathe.

*I wanted it to last.*

*I wantâ€”*

Eben's voice, breaking on words he couldn't finish.

Eben, who never broke.

Eben, who'd deleted the contract.

Eben, who was standing outside his building in the cold, saying things Noel had been desperate to hear.

And Noel had sent him away.

---

His hands were shaking.

His chest hurt.

His eyes burned.

*Why didn't you let him up?*

Because he couldn't think when Eben was close.

Because he didn't trust himself not to forgive everything just to stop the pain.

Because he needed to know if Eben's words were real, and he couldn't know that if he was drowning in Eben's presence.

---

Noel slid down the door.

Sat on the floor.

Pressed his palms against his eyes.

*He said he wanted it to last.*

*He said he was scared.*

*He said he was choosing to stay.*

Were those just words?

Or were they real?

---

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

Frayed. Fragile. Barely holding on.

Just like him.

Noel looked at it.

And thought: *Maybe.*

For the first time in two days, the word didn't feel like a death sentence.

It felt likeâ€”

A beginning.

Maybe.


---

## Chapter 7: The Wait

**Day 10, Dec 23 â€” Night**

**NOEL**

Eventually, Noel got up from the floor.

Eventually, he moved to the couch.

Eventually, he stopped shaking.

But the questions didn't stop.

---

*Did he mean it?*

*Was it real?*

*Or is this just another version of temporary?*

Noel sat in the dark, knees pulled to his chest, and tried to untangle the mess in his head.

Eben had come to his apartment.

Had stood outside in the cold.

Had said things that sounded likeâ€”

Like he meant them.

*I wanted it to last.*

*You matter. More than anything has ever mattered.*

*I deleted the contract.*

---

The contract.

The January job.

The exit strategy Eben had been keeping in his back pocket, just in case.

He'd deleted it.

Before coming here.

Before knowing if Noel would even let him in.

That meant something.

Didn't it?

---

*Or he's just saying what you want to hear.*

The thought was poison.

But it was alsoâ€”reasonable.

Eben had said "this was never supposed to last" too.

Had looked right at Noel and said the words that had broken everything.

How was Noel supposed to know which version was real?

---

He looked at the ribbon.

Still on his wrist.

Frayed. Fragile.

A reminder of everything that had been and everything that might never be again.

*Tomorrow,* Noel thought.

*I said I'd give him tomorrow.*

The thought felt heavy.

Terrifying.

But alsoâ€”

Maybeâ€”

A little bit like hope.

---

**EBEN**

Eben didn't sleep.

Couldn't sleep.

Just lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying the conversation.

---

*"I can't process this right now."*

*"Can you give me until tomorrow?"*

*"Tomorrow."*

Noel had heard him.

Had listened.

Had asked for time instead of telling him to leave forever.

That was something.

Right?

---

Eben pulled the key box from his jacket pocket.

Opened it.

The key gleamed in the dim light.

He'd been carrying it for weeks.

Through all the fear.

Through the terrible words.

Through the destruction of everything that mattered.

And he was still holding onto it.

Because some part of him had always known.

Had always hoped.

Had always believed that maybeâ€”

Maybe Noel was worth being brave for.

---

*Tomorrow.*

Christmas Eve.

The last day of the festival.

The day Eben was going to fight for what he wanted.

---

He thought about what Sam had said.

*"Noel deserves someone who fights for him. Someone who chooses him. Even when it's scary."*

Eben had been choosing fear his entire life.

Had been running from anything that might hurt him.

And it had cost him everything.

But tomorrowâ€”

Tomorrow, he was going to choose differently.

Tomorrow, he was going to be brave.

Even if it killed him.

---

He closed the box.

Put it on the nightstand.

And stared at the ceiling.

Waiting for morning.

Waiting for his chance.

Waiting to see if any of this could be saved.

---

**NOEL**

The night stretched on.

Noel dozed. Woke. Dozed again.

Dreams slipping through his fingers like water.

---

In one dream, Eben was standing outside the warehouse.

Holding a key.

Saying: *"You're welcome here. Always."*

In another dream, Eben was leaving.

Getting in his truck.

Driving away.

Not looking back.

The dreams tangled together until Noel couldn't tell which one was the nightmare.

---

He woke before dawn.

Lay there in the grey light.

Thinking about today.

Christmas Eve.

The last day of the festival.

The day Eben had asked to talk.

---

*What are you going to say?*

He didn't know.

*What do you want?*

He didn't know that either.

Noâ€”that was a lie.

He knew exactly what he wanted.

He wanted Eben.

Wanted it to be real.

Wanted the words from last night to be true.

He just didn't know if he could trust them.

---

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

Noel touched it gently.

The frayed edge.

The bright red silk.

The proof that something had been real, even if only for a moment.

*Tomorrow,* he'd said.

And tomorrow was here.

---

He got up.

Showered.

Dressed.

Went through the motions.

And tried not to think about what the day might bring.

But his heart was already racing.

And somewhere underneath all the fearâ€”

Underneath all the doubtâ€”

There was something else.

Something that felt dangerously close to hope.

## Chapter 8: Hook Ending

**Day 10, Dec 23 â€” Late Night**

**NOEL**

(Earlier that evening, before trying to sleep)

The apartment was silent.

Noel stood in the doorway with his keys still in his hand, like he'd forgotten what came next.

This was his life.

Cold air. Quiet rooms. The hum of the fridge pretending it was company.

But something had shifted.

---

Eben's voice echoed in his head.

*"I wanted it to last."*

*"I'm not running."*

*"I deleted the contract."*

Words that might mean everything.

Words that might mean nothing.

Noel wouldn't know until tomorrow.

---

He went to the bedroom and sat on the edge of the mattress.

The empty side stared back at him.

The side where Eben had slept.

Where he'd woken up that one perfect morning and looked at Noel like he was everything.

Before the fear won.

Before the walls went back up.

Before everything broke.

---

His wrist itched.

The ribbon.

Bright red, stupidly cheerful, cutting into skin that didn't deserve to be marked up for a promise that hadn't held.

Noel hooked a nail under the knot.

Pulled.

The bow loosened.

His breath hitched so hard it hurt.

---

He froze with the ends in his fingers, as if letting go would make the whole week evaporate. As if the second it came off, Eben would become a dream Noel had invented to survive December.

Butâ€”

But Eben had come here tonight.

Had stood outside in the cold.

Had said things that sounded like the truth.

*"I wanted it to last."*

---

Noel looked at the ribbon.

Really looked at it.

Frayed. Fragile. Barely holding on.

Just like them.

*Maybe,* he'd thought earlier.

*Maybe* was the most dangerous word in the world.

But it was also the only one that felt true.

---

He didn't take the ribbon off.

Not because he was holding onto a lie.

But becauseâ€”

Because maybe it wasn't a lie.

Because maybe tomorrow would give him answers.

Because maybeâ€”just maybeâ€”Eben had meant every word.

---

Noel curled forward, elbows on his knees, ribbon ends still loose around his wrist.

And in the dark, alone where no one could see, he let himself feel it.

The hope he'd been trying to kill.

The want he'd been trying to bury.

The desperate, terrifying possibility that this wasn't over.

---

One breath.

Then another.

Then the tears that finally found him.

Not the broken, devastated sobs of two nights ago.

Something different.

Something that felt likeâ€”

Release.

---

The ribbon stayed.

The hope stayed.

And Noel fell asleep waiting for tomorrow.

Waiting for Christmas Eve.

Waiting to see if Eben would fight for them the way he'd promised.

---

*Tomorrow,* he thought, just before sleep took him.

*Tomorrow, I'll know.*

And for the first time in days, the thought didn't feel like a death sentence.

It felt like a beginning.
