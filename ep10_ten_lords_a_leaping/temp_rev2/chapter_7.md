## Chapter 7: The Precipice

**Day 10, Dec 23 — The Event**

**NOEL**

Two more days.

Two more days until Christmas. Two more days of the Twelve Days of Tinsel Town.

Tomorrow was Christmas Eve. Tomorrow was the real last chance.

But today—

Today, he still had to see Eben.

Noel lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, and thought: *One more day.*

*Just get through one more day.*

*And then you can fall apart.*

The thought should have been comforting.

It wasn't.

---

He got up.

Went through the motions.

Shower. Coffee. The nice clothes that said *I'm fine.*

The mask.

Always the mask.

He was so tired of the mask.

But what choice did he have?

If he let it slip—

If he let people see—

They'd ask questions. Offer sympathy. Try to help.

And Noel didn't want help.

Didn't want pity.

Didn't want anyone to see how completely he'd fallen apart.

So he put on the mask.

Smiled at his reflection.

And prepared for one more performance.

---

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

He'd tried to take it off last night.

Had sat there, fingers on the knot, ready to untie it.

Couldn't.

Because taking it off would mean accepting that it was over.

Would mean letting go of the last piece of evidence that any of it had been real.

And he wasn't ready.

Might never be ready.

So he left it.

Left the ribbon on his wrist like a scar.

Like a reminder.

Like proof that he'd been stupid enough to hope.

---

His phone buzzed.

A text from Mayor Kringle: *Big day! Charity cleanup at the rink! Let's make it happen!*

Too many exclamation points.

Too much enthusiasm.

Noel stared at the message and thought: *I can't do this.*

*I can't smile through one more day.*

*I can't pretend I'm fine when I'm breaking.*

But he would.

Because that's what he did.

That's what he'd always done.

Useful. Reliable. Fine.

Even when he wasn't.

Especially when he wasn't.

---

He grabbed his keys.

Headed for the door.

Stopped.

Looked back at his apartment.

At the empty space. The cold bed. The silence.

This was his life.

This was what he had.

This was what he'd go back to after today.

After the festival ended.

After Eben—

After Eben was gone.

Really gone.

Not just distant.

Not just avoiding him.

Actually gone.

Because there'd be no more events. No more excuses to be in the same space.

No more accidental eye contact across crowded squares.

No more almost-conversations.

Just—

Nothing.

---

Noel's chest tightened.

He couldn't breathe.

Couldn't think.

Couldn't—

He pressed his hand against the wall.

Tried to ground himself.

Tried to remember how to function.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*Just one more day.*

*Just get through one more day.*

The lie felt thinner than ever.

But it was all he had.

---

**EBEN**

Eben arrived at Evergreen Square early.

Before the crowds. Before the chaos. Before Noel.

He needed—

He needed a moment.

Needed to prepare himself.

Needed to figure out what he was going to say.

---

The square was quiet.

Peaceful.

The calm before the storm.

Decorations everywhere. Lights twinkling. The festival in its final glory.

Tomorrow, it would all come down.

Tomorrow, the town would go back to normal.

Tomorrow, this would all be over.

And Eben would either have Noel back.

Or he wouldn't.

---

He sat on a bench.

Pulled out the small box.

Opened it.

The key gleamed in the morning light.

Simple. Practical. Significant.

A key to his space.

To the place he'd built to keep people out.

He'd been planning to give it to Noel on Christmas.

Had been planning to say: *I want you here. I want this to last. I want you.*

And then he'd panicked.

Had destroyed it.

Had said the opposite.

---

Could he give it to Noel now?

Would it mean anything?

Or would it just be—

Too little, too late.

A gesture that couldn't fix what he'd broken.

Eben didn't know.

But he had to try.

Had to show Noel that he meant it.

That he was choosing differently.

That he was choosing Noel.

---

"You're here early."

Wes's voice.

Eben looked up.

Wes was standing there, holding two coffees, looking at Eben with something that might have been sympathy.

"Yeah," Eben said. "Couldn't sleep."

"I can imagine." Wes handed him a coffee. Sat down beside him. "You look like hell."

"Thanks."

"You're welcome." Wes sipped his coffee. "You going to fix this?"

"I'm going to try."

"Good." Wes was quiet for a moment. Then: "He's breaking, you know."

Eben's chest tightened. "I know."

"He's pretending he's fine. Smiling at everyone. Being useful. But he's breaking."

"I know."

"Do you?" Wes's voice was sharp. "Because from where I'm sitting, you broke him. And I'm not sure you understand what that means."

Eben looked away. "I understand."

"Do you? Because Noel doesn't let people in. Ever. He smiles and helps and makes himself indispensable, but he doesn't—he doesn't trust people with the real parts of himself."

"I know."

"He trusted you." Wes's voice was quiet. Hard. "He let you in. Really in. And you—"

"I destroyed it. I know."

"So what are you going to do about it?"

"I'm going to apologize. I'm going to tell him the truth. I'm going to—" Eben stopped. "I'm going to choose him. Even if he doesn't choose me back."

Wes studied him for a long moment.

Then nodded. "Good. Because he deserves that. Deserves someone who fights for him. Who chooses him. Who doesn't run when it gets hard."

"I know."

"Then don't screw it up."

Wes stood. Walked away.

And Eben sat there, holding his coffee, and thought: *Don't screw it up.*

*Right.*

*No pressure.*

---

**NOEL**

Noel arrived at the square and immediately saw Eben.

Sitting on a bench. Alone. Looking—

Tired.

Sad.

Lost.

Noel's heart stuttered.

He wanted to go to him.

Wanted to sit beside him.

Wanted to ask if he was okay.

But he couldn't.

Because they weren't—

They weren't that anymore.

Weren't anything.

Just two people who used to—

Who used to be everything.

And now were nothing.

---

Eben looked up.

Their eyes met.

And for a moment—just a moment—Noel saw it.

Saw the regret. The pain. The desperate want.

Saw Eben.

The real Eben.

The one who felt everything and was terrified of it.

The one who'd said *I love you* and meant it.

The one who'd destroyed them because he didn't know how to keep them.

---

Noel looked away first.

Couldn't handle it.

Couldn't handle the way Eben was looking at him.

Like he wanted to say something.

Like he wanted to fix this.

Like he thought there was anything left to fix.

---

The day began.

The charity cleanup. Day ten of the festival.

Dec 23 in Tinsel Town.

People arrived. Vendors set up. The square filled with life and laughter and holiday cheer.

And Noel moved through it like a ghost.

Smiling. Helping. Being useful.

Dying inside.

---

They orbited each other all day.

Never touching. Never speaking directly.

But always—always—aware.

Noel felt Eben's presence like a physical thing.

Could track his position without looking.

Could sense when he was near.

Could feel the weight of his gaze.

It was torture.

---

Eben watched Noel smile at strangers.

Watched him help vendors.

Watched him be everything to everyone.

Except himself.

And Eben thought: *I did this.*

*I made him retreat.*

*I made him put the mask back on.*

*I made him believe he wasn't enough.*

---

The day wore on.

Events. Activities. The final celebration.

Everyone seemed happy.

Everyone except the two people who'd made it all possible.

Who stood in the same space.

And felt miles apart.

---

**NOEL**

As the sun started to set, Noel found himself alone for a moment.

Standing near the edge of the square. Away from the crowd.

Just—breathing.

Trying to hold it together for a few more hours.

Tomorrow, it would be over.

Tomorrow, he could fall apart.

Tomorrow—

"Noel."

Eben's voice.

Quiet. Careful. Close.

Noel's entire body went rigid.

He didn't turn around.

Couldn't turn around.

Because if he looked at Eben—

If he saw his face—

He might break.

And he couldn't break.

Not here.

Not now.

Not when he'd made it this far.

"Not now," Noel said quietly. "Please."

His voice didn't crack this time.

He was proud of that.

"Noel, I need to—"

"Not now, Eben." Noel's hands clenched. "I can't—I can't do this right now."

Silence.

Then: "Okay."

Eben's voice was soft. Broken.

"Tomorrow," Eben said. "Can we—can we talk tomorrow?"

Noel closed his eyes.

Tomorrow.

After the festival.

After it was all over.

After there was no reason to see each other anymore.

"Maybe," Noel said.

It was the best he could offer.

The most honest thing he could say.

Because he didn't know.

Didn't know if he could handle talking to Eben.

Didn't know if he could hear whatever Eben wanted to say.

Didn't know if he could survive it.

---

Eben didn't push.

Just said: "Okay."

And walked away.

And Noel stood there, alone, and thought: *One more day.*

*Just one more day.*

*And then it's over.*

The thought felt like a death sentence.
