## Chapter 4: The Yearning

**NOEL**

Noel had never been to Frost Line Logistics before.

Had never seen Eben's space. His work. The place he'd built.

And now he was here.

Standing in the middle of it.

Surrounded by Eben's careful organization. His systems. His control.

It felt—

Wrong.

And right.

And devastating.

---

The warehouse was exactly what Noel would have expected.

Clean. Organized. Efficient.

Everything labeled. Everything in its place. Everything controlled.

No personal touches. No photos. No evidence that a human being actually worked here.

Just—systems.

Like Eben had built a space that perfectly reflected who he pretended to be.

Cold. Distant. Untouchable.

Except Noel knew better.

Knew that underneath all that control was someone who felt everything.

Who was terrified of feeling everything.

Who'd rather destroy something beautiful than risk being hurt by it.

---

The event had settled into the space.

Tables set up. Donation bins organized. People browsing. Volunteers helping.

The charity tree haul, transplanted indoors.

It was working.

Everyone seemed fine with it.

Except Noel.

Who stood near the far wall, holding a clipboard he wasn't reading, and tried not to think about where he was.

Tried not to think about what it meant.

Tried not to think about Eben.

Failed.

---

Someone called his name.

Noel turned. Smiled. Answered a question about donation sorting.

Went back to his clipboard.

His hands were shaking slightly.

He pressed them flat against the paper.

*Get it together,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*You can get through one afternoon.*

The lie tasted familiar.

Comfortable, even.

Like an old friend he'd known his entire life.

---

He moved through the afternoon on autopilot.

Helping vendors. Organizing donations. Answering questions.

Smiling. Always smiling.

The performance of fine-ness.

He was very good at it.

Had been practicing his entire life.

---

At one point, he was sorting donation bins near the coffee station.

A volunteer had mislabeled one—"Winter Clothes" written on a box of kitchen supplies.

"Hey, Noel?" The volunteer looked embarrassed. "I think I mixed these up."

"No problem," Noel said, reaching for the label. "Easy fix."

But his hand slipped. The marker fell. Rolled under the table.

He bent to retrieve it, and the ribbon on his wrist caught on the table edge.

Snagged.

Pulled tight.

The silk thread frayed slightly.

Noel froze.

His breath stopped. His heart stuttered.

The ribbon was tearing.

Just a little. Just enough to notice.

He carefully unhooked it, fingers trembling.

When he looked up, Eben was across the room.

Watching.

Their eyes met.

Eben's expression shifted. Something raw flickering there.

Then someone called Eben's name, and he turned away.

And Noel stood there, holding the marker, staring at the frayed edge of the ribbon.

*Don't hope,* he told himself. *Don't you dare hope.*

---

The warehouse was cold.

Industrial. Impersonal.

So empty.

Noel looked around at the shelving. The organization. The complete lack of anything personal.

And thought: *This is where Eben feels safe.*

*This is what he built when he decided not to need anyone.*

The realization settled in his chest like lead.

---

Later, he watched Eben help an elderly vendor carry a heavy box.

Watched him crouch down to fix a little girl's mitten when it fell off.

Watched him quietly redirect a confused volunteer with patience and kindness.

Small things.

Quiet things.

The kind of things that made Noel's chest ache.

Because that was Eben.

The real Eben.

The one who cared so much he had to build walls to survive it.

And it destabilized Noel completely.

Made him want things he couldn't have.

Made him hope when he'd promised himself he wouldn't.

---

He found himself near the back shelving at one point.

Away from the crowd. Away from the noise.

Just—standing there.

In the quiet space between the rows.

Surrounded by Eben's organization. His systems. His control.

---

"Noel."

Eben's voice.

Quiet. Careful.

Noel's entire body went rigid.

He turned.

Eben was standing a few feet away. Hands in his pockets. Expression unreadable.

They were alone.

Hidden by the shelving. Away from the crowd.

Just them.

In Eben's space.

In the quiet.

---

Noel's heart was pounding so hard it hurt.

"Eben," he said. His voice sounded normal. Good.

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Seemed to be struggling with something.

"I—" he started.

Noel's chest tightened.

*Don't,* he thought. *Please don't.*

*I can't do this.*

*Not today.*

*Not here.*

"Don't," Noel said quietly.

Eben stopped.

"I need to—" Eben tried again.

"Not today." Noel's voice cracked. "Please."

The word came out broken.

Raw.

Honest in a way Noel hadn't meant it to be.

---

Eben went very still.

Something shifted in his expression. Pain. Understanding. Regret.

"Okay," he said quietly.

He didn't move.

Didn't leave.

Just stood there, looking at Noel like he was something precious and broken and Eben didn't know how to fix it.

Noel couldn't handle it.

Couldn't handle the way Eben was looking at him.

Couldn't handle being this close.

Couldn't handle the way his body wanted to reach out.

Wanted to close the distance.

Wanted to believe that maybe—

No.

No.

He couldn't do this.

---

"I have to go," Noel said.

He walked away.

Didn't look back.

Didn't let himself look back.

Because if he looked back—

If he saw Eben's face—

He might break.

And he couldn't break.

Not here.

Not in front of everyone.

Not when he'd worked so hard to hold it together.

---

Noel made it to the front of the warehouse.

Found a quiet corner.

Pressed his back against the wall.

And tried to breathe.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*Just get through the rest of the day.*

*Just get through this.*

But his hands were shaking.

And his chest was too tight.

And he could still feel Eben's presence.

Could still see the way he'd looked at Noel.

Like he wanted to say something.

Like he wanted to fix this.

Like he didn't know how.

---

The storm continued outside.

The event continued inside.

And Noel stood in the corner of Eben's warehouse, surrounded by people, and felt more alone than he'd ever felt in his life.

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

Bright red against his skin.

The frayed edge catching the light.

A promise that had become a lie.

A reminder of everything he'd lost.

Everything he'd never really had.

Noel stared at it and thought: *I should take it off.*

*I should let go.*

*I should accept that it's over.*

But he couldn't.

Not yet.

Not when it was the only proof that any of it had been real.

Even if only for a moment.

Even if only temporarily.

Even if it had all been a mistake.

---

Someone called his name.

Noel took a breath.

Put on his smile.

And went back to work.

Back to being useful.

Back to pretending he was fine.

Because that's what he did.

That's what he'd always done.

And he was very, very good at it.
