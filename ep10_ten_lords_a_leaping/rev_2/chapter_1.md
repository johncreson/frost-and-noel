## Chapter 1: Morning After Rupture

**Day 10, Dec 23**

**NOEL**

The bed was cold.

This was not news. Noel had been sleeping alone for years before Eben. He knew how to do this. He was very good at being alone.

He was handling it fine.

This was a lie, but it was a devastated lie, which was less festive than usual but still counted.

---

Noel stared at the ceiling and cataloged the situation.

One: He was awake. Technically. His eyes were open. That was close enough.

Two: It was morning. Probably. The light coming through the window suggested daylight, though it could also be the apocalypse. Hard to tell.

Three: Eben was gone.

Not gone as in *left the bed to make coffee*. Gone as in *never coming back because he'd said "this was never supposed to last" and Noel had said "okay" like a functioning person who definitely wasn't dying inside.*

So. Fine.

Everything was fine.

---

Shower. Hot enough to hurt.

Noel stood under the spray and tried to feel something. Anything. The water was scalding. His skin turned red. He registered this information the way someone might register the weather in a country they'd never visit.

Distantly.

Academically.

Not at all.

---

Clothes next.

The nice ones. The ones that said *I'm a professional adult human doing professional adult human things.*

Noel pulled on pants. Buttoned a shirt. Located socks that matched. This was called *functioning*. He was very good at it.

His hands only shook a little.

That was probably the cold.

December in Tinsel Town didn't mess around, and neither did Noel's central heating, which had the reliability of a coin flip and the temperament of a feral cat.

He left the ribbon on his wrist.

Didn't look at it.

Couldn't take it off.

The bright red silk sat against his skin like evidence. Like a scar. Like the only proof that any of it had been real.

---

Coffee.

Black. Because adding milk required decision-making, and Noel's brain had approximately three functional neurons left, all of which were currently occupied with the critical task of *not screaming.*

He sat at his kitchen table.

Drank the coffee.

Didn't taste it.

His hands smelled like dish soap from last night's cleanup. The coffee was burnt—he'd forgotten to turn off the pot before bed. The ribbon scratched against his wrist every time he moved.

The apartment was quiet. Too quiet.

He'd always liked the quiet before. The space. The sense of having something that was his.

Now it just felt—empty. Wrong. Like someone had scooped out the good parts and left the shell.

---

*This is fine,* Noel thought.

*I've done this before.*

He had. He'd survived breakups and disappointments and heartbreaks that felt world-ending at the time but turned out to be survivable.

This was just another one.

Except it wasn't.

Because this was Eben.

And Eben had been—

Eben had been everything.

For a moment.

For a brief, perfect, devastating moment.

Noel's chest did something complicated. Tight and sharp and wrong.

He took another sip of coffee.

The taste was metallic now. Wrong. His mouth too dry.

---

His phone buzzed.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Morning! Big day today! Charity tree haul at Evergreen Square! See you at 9!*

Noel stared at the message.

Right.

The event.

The one he'd been coordinating for weeks. The one that involved vendors and volunteers and approximately ninety-seven moving parts, all of which required his attention.

The one that would also involve Eben.

Same space. Same town. Same man who'd destroyed him less than twenty-four hours ago.

His stomach dropped.

---

*Useful = worthy.*

That was the equation. The only equation that worked.

So he would be useful.

He would work. He would coordinate. He would smile and fix problems and make himself indispensable.

And he would not think about last night.

Would not think about Eben's face when he said *this was never supposed to last.*

Would not think about the way his own voice had sounded when he said *okay.*

Flat. Accepting. The sound of someone who'd expected this all along.

Because he had.

Hadn't he?

---

Noel stood.

Rinsed his mug. Put it in the dishwasher.

Grabbed his coat. His keys. His phone.

Checked his reflection in the hallway mirror.

The face staring back looked—normal. Functional. Fine.

The smile was practiced. Easy. The kind of smile that said *I'm okay, don't worry about me, I'm always okay.*

Nobody would see through it.

Nobody ever did.

---

He left the apartment.

Locked the door behind him.

Walked to his car through the cold December morning.

The sky was grey. Heavy. Storm clouds building on the horizon like the universe had decided to provide visual metaphors for his emotional state.

*Perfect,* Noel thought. *Even the weather's dramatic.*

He got in the car.

Started the engine.

Sat there for a moment, hands on the wheel, and thought: *I can do this.*

*I can get through one day.*

The lie settled in his chest like lead.

But he put the car in drive anyway.

---

The drive to Evergreen Square was short.

Too short.

Noel pulled into the parking area and saw the setup already underway.

Vendors. Volunteers. The usual organized chaos of a Tinsel Town event.

And there—

There, near the main staging area—

Eben.

Noel's heart stuttered.

Eben was talking to someone. Gesturing at a clipboard. Looking calm and collected and completely unaffected.

Like nothing had happened.

Like he hadn't destroyed Noel less than twenty-four hours ago.

Like this was just another day.

Noel's hands tightened on the steering wheel.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *Mask on. Smile ready.*

*Nobody gets to see you break.*

He took a breath.

Got out of the car.

And walked toward the event.

Toward Eben.

Toward the performance of a lifetime.

---

The first person to notice him was Wes.

Of course it was Wes.

Wes had the uncanny ability to materialize exactly when you least wanted him to, bearing coffee and concern in equal measure.

"Morning," Wes said, appearing at his elbow with a to-go cup. Because of course he did. Wes always had coffee.

"Morning," Noel said.

His voice sounded normal.

Good.

"You okay?" Wes asked.

The question was gentle. Careful. The kind of careful that meant Wes already knew the answer.

"Yeah," Noel said. "Why?"

Wes gave him a look.

The look said: *I know you're lying but I'm not going to push.*

The look also said: *I'm here when you're ready.*

The look was kind, which made it worse.

"No reason," Wes said. "Coffee?"

"Thanks."

Noel took the cup. Sipped it.

Tasted nothing. His taste buds had apparently gone on strike along with the rest of his functional systems.

"Big day today," Wes said.

"Yeah."

"Storm's coming in later. Might have to move things indoors."

"We'll figure it out."

"Yeah." Wes paused. "You sure you're okay?"

"I'm fine."

The lie came easily.

It always did.

Wes studied him for a moment longer. Then nodded. "Okay. Let me know if you need anything."

"Will do."

Wes walked away.

And Noel stood there, holding his coffee, staring at the event setup.

At Eben.

Who still hadn't looked at him.

---

Noel took a breath.

Put on his smile.

And walked toward the staging area.

Toward the work.

Toward the performance.

He was handling it fine.

He was always fine.

Even when he wasn't.

Especially when he wasn't.
