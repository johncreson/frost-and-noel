## Chapter 5: The Storm Clears

**EBEN**

The storm passed as quickly as it had arrived.

One moment, rain pounding against the roof. Thunder rolling. Wind howling.

The next—

Silence.

The kind of heavy, expectant silence that came after chaos.

---

People started gathering their things.

The event was winding down. Donations sorted. Trees distributed. The charity haul a success.

Mayor Kringle was beaming. The vendors were satisfied. The volunteers were cheerful.

Everyone seemed pleased with how it had turned out.

Everyone except the two people who'd made it happen.

---

Eben stood near the loading dock, watching people leave.

Thanking them. Helping load vehicles. Being professional.

Being empty.

Because Noel's words kept echoing in his head.

*"Not today. Please."*

The way his voice had cracked on "please."

The way he'd looked at Eben—raw and hurt and barely holding it together.

The way he'd walked away without looking back.

Eben had wanted to follow.

Had wanted to push.

Had wanted to say: *I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I love you.*

But he hadn't.

Because Noel had asked him not to.

Had said "please" in that broken voice.

And Eben couldn't—

He couldn't ignore that.

Couldn't push when Noel was barely holding on.

So he'd let him go.

Again.

---

The warehouse was emptying.

People trickling out. Calling goodbyes. Thanking Eben for the space.

He nodded. Smiled. Said the right things.

And felt nothing.

Just—hollow.

Like he'd scooped out everything that mattered and left only the shell.

---

He saw Noel near the exit.

Talking to Wes. Smiling. Looking perfectly fine.

That bright, practiced smile that meant absolutely nothing.

Eben's chest tightened.

Because he knew that smile.

Knew what it cost.

Knew that underneath it, Noel was breaking.

And it was Eben's fault.

---

Noel left without saying goodbye.

Just—walked out.

Got in his car.

Drove away.

Efficient. Mechanical. No hesitation.

Like he couldn't get out of there fast enough.

Eben stood in the doorway and watched him go.

And thought: *I'm losing him.*

*I've already lost him.*

*And I don't know how to get him back.*

---

**NOEL**

Noel made it to his car before his hands started shaking.

Made it out of the parking lot before his vision blurred.

Made it three blocks before he had to pull over.

He sat there, engine running, hands gripping the steering wheel, and tried to breathe.

*You're fine,* he told himself. *You're fine.*

*You got through it.*

*You didn't break.*

But the lie felt thin.

Fragile.

Like one more thing—one more look, one more word, one more moment—would shatter it completely.

---

His phone was in his hand.

He didn't remember picking it up.

But there it was.

Eben's contact on the screen.

His thumb hovered over the call button.

*Just call him,* part of him whispered. *Just ask.*

*Ask if he meant it. Ask if there's still a chance. Ask if—*

No.

He couldn't.

Couldn't risk hearing it again.

Couldn't survive another "this was never supposed to last."

Noel deleted the half-typed text he didn't remember starting.

Put the phone down.

Stared at the steering wheel.

*Not yet,* he thought. *Not yet.*

---

He took a breath.

Put the car in drive.

And headed home.

To his empty apartment.

To his cold bed.

To the silence that used to feel comfortable and now just felt—

Lonely.

---

**EBEN**

The warehouse was empty.

Everyone gone. Event over. Just Eben and the space he'd built.

He walked through it slowly.

Past the shelving. Past the staging area. Past the spot where he'd stood with Sam.

Past the place where Noel had said "please" in that broken voice.

And then he saw it.

On the floor near the back shelving.

A pen.

Noel's pen.

The one he'd been using on his clipboard all afternoon. Blue ink. Slightly chewed cap.

Eben picked it up.

Turned it over in his hands.

Such a small thing.

Ordinary. Insignificant.

But it was Noel's.

And it was here.

In Eben's space.

Proof that he'd been here.

That this had been real.

---

Eben stood there, holding the pen, and thought: *This is what I chose.*

*This is what I protected.*

*This empty space.*

*These walls.*

*This loneliness.*

And it wasn't enough.

It had never been enough.

He'd just been too scared to admit it.

---

Tomorrow.

Christmas Eve.

He'd fix this.

He'd apologize. Explain. Tell Noel the truth.

*I was scared. I didn't mean it. I love you. I'm choosing you.*

And if Noel said no—

If Noel couldn't forgive him—

Then Eben would live with it.

Would accept the consequence.

Would know that he'd tried.

But he had to try.

Had to fight.

Had to choose Noel over his fear.

Even if it terrified him.

Even if he didn't know how.

Even if he failed.

---

Eben pocketed the pen.

Locked up the warehouse.

Got in his truck.

Drove home through the dark streets.

The storm had passed. The sky was clearing. Stars visible through the breaking clouds.

Tomorrow would be Christmas Eve.

The last day of the festival.

The last chance.

And Eben was going to take it.

Was going to choose differently.

Was going to be brave.

Even if it killed him.

---

**NOEL**

Noel went through the motions.

Shower. Pajamas. Tea he didn't drink.

Sat on the couch. Stared at nothing.

The ribbon was still on his wrist.

He couldn't take it off.

Couldn't let go.

Couldn't accept that it was over.

Even though it was.

Even though Eben had made that clear.

Even though "this was never supposed to last" was the truth.

---

Tomorrow was Christmas Eve.

The last day of the festival.

One more day of pretending.

One more day of smiling.

One more day of being useful.

And then—

And then it would be over.

The festival would end.

The town would go back to normal.

And Noel would go back to—

This.

Empty apartment. Cold bed. Silence.

The way it had always been.

The way it would always be.

---

He looked at the ribbon.

Bright red against his skin.

A promise that had become a lie.

And thought: *Maybe I should have known better than to hope.*

*Maybe temporary was always the only thing I was ever going to get.*

*Maybe that's all I'm worth.*

The thought settled in his chest like lead.

Heavy. Suffocating. True.

Because if he'd been worth more—

If he'd been enough—

Eben would have chosen him.

Would have fought for him.

Would have said "I want this to last" instead of "this was never supposed to last."

But he hadn't.

And Noel knew what that meant.

---

He went to bed.

Lay there in the dark.

Stared at the empty side of the bed.

The side where Eben had slept.

Where he'd woken up that one perfect morning and looked at Noel like he was everything.

Before the fear won.

Before the walls went back up.

Before everything broke.

---

Noel closed his eyes.

And thought: *One more day.*

*Just get through one more day.*

*And then it's over.*

The thought should have been comforting.

Should have felt like relief.

Should have felt like the end of something painful.

But it didn't.

It just felt—

Empty.

Like everything else.
