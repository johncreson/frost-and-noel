## Chapter 3: The Storm Arrives

**EBEN**

Frost Line Logistics was not designed for emotional confrontations.

It was designed for pallets and shipping manifests and the kind of organized efficiency that made Eben's brain happy.

Clean lines. Clear systems. Everything in its place.

No mess. No chaos. No feelings.

And yet.

---

The warehouse was massive.

High ceilings. Industrial lighting. Rows of shelving stretching toward the back.

It smelled like cardboard and metal and cold air.

Impersonal. Functional. Empty.

Exactly like Eben.

Or at least—exactly like Eben pretended to be.

---

People flooded in as the rain started in earnest.

Volunteers. Vendors. Equipment. Donations.

The organized chaos of the charity event transplanted into Eben's carefully controlled space.

He directed traffic. Pointed people toward open areas. Helped unload.

And tried very hard not to watch Noel.

Failed.

Because Noel was here.

In his space.

The place Eben had built specifically to keep the world out.

And now the world was here.

And Noel was here.

And Eben didn't know how to handle it.

---

Noel stood near the entrance, looking around.

Taking in the space. The organization. The complete lack of personal touches.

No photos. No decorations. No evidence that a human being actually worked here.

Just—systems. Efficiency. Control.

Eben watched him look and thought: *This is who I am.*

*This is what I built.*

*Empty. Organized. Alone.*

And for the first time, it felt—

Wrong.

---

The event setup continued.

Tables arranged. Donation bins organized. The charity tree haul transformed into an indoor operation.

Mayor Kringle was relieved. The vendors were adaptable. The volunteers were cheerful.

Everyone seemed fine with the change.

Except Eben.

Who stood in the middle of his warehouse, surrounded by people, and felt more alone than he had in years.

---

"Eben."

Sam's voice. Quiet. Deliberate.

Eben turned.

Sam was standing near the back shelving, arms crossed, expression unreadable.

"Can I talk to you for a minute?"

It wasn't really a question.

"Yeah," Eben said. "Sure."

They walked toward the back of the warehouse. Away from the crowd. Into the quiet space between the shelves.

Sam didn't waste time.

"You're doing that thing you do," he said.

Eben's stomach dropped. "What thing."

"The thing where you ruin everything before it can ruin you."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Eben opened his mouth. Closed it. Had no idea what to say.

Sam waited.

Patient. Implacable. The way he always was when he'd decided to say something that needed saying.

"I don't—" Eben started.

"Yes, you do." Sam's voice was calm. Matter-of-fact. "I've known you for five years, Eben. I've watched you do this with jobs. With friendships. With anything that gets too close."

"That's not—"

"It is." Sam's eyes were steady. Unflinching. "You find something good. Something that matters. And the second it starts to feel real—the second you start to need it—you destroy it."

Eben's throat closed.

Because Sam was right.

Sam was always right.

That was the problem with Sam. He saw things. Understood things. And he didn't let you hide from them.

"I didn't mean to—" Eben said quietly.

"I know you didn't mean to." Sam's voice softened slightly. "That's the worst part. You don't even realize you're doing it. It's just—automatic. Self-protection. The pattern you learned a long time ago."

A forklift beeped somewhere in the warehouse. Someone called out for help with a heavy box. The sound of the real world intruding.

Sam paused, glanced toward the noise, then turned back to Eben.

"I was scared," Eben admitted.

"So you ran."

"Yes."

"While standing still."

Eben looked away. "Yes."

---

Sam was quiet for a moment.

Then: "Wes told me you were good for Noel."

Eben's head snapped up.

"He said Noel was different with you," Sam continued. "Lighter. Happier. Like he'd finally found someone who saw him. Really saw him. Not just what he could do for them."

Eben's chest tightened.

"I believed him," Sam said. "I thought—finally. Someone who gets it. Someone who understands that Noel's worth more than just being useful."

He paused.

"Was he wrong?"

The question hung in the air.

Simple. Devastating.

*Was he wrong?*

Had Eben ever been good for Noel?

Or had he just been another person who took what Noel offered and then left when it got too hard?

---

"I don't know," Eben said quietly.

"That's not good enough."

Eben didn't respond. Couldn't.

"You hurt him," Sam said.

"I know."

"He's out there right now, pretending he's fine. Smiling at everyone. Being useful. Making sure nobody worries about him." Sam's voice was hard. "And he's breaking. Can you see that? He's breaking, and he's doing it alone, because you made him think he wasn't enough."

The words hit like a gut punch.

"I didn't mean—"

"It doesn't matter what you meant. It matters what you said. And what you said was: 'This was never supposed to last.'"

Eben flinched.

"Did you mean it?" Sam asked.

"No."

"Then why did you say it?"

"Because I was terrified." The admission came out raw. Honest. "Because it was real. Because I needed him. Because I—" His voice broke. "Because I didn't know how to be that vulnerable."

"So you destroyed it."

"Yes."

"Before it could destroy you."

Eben nodded slowly.

Sam studied him. "That's what I thought."

---

They stood there in silence.

The warehouse hummed around them. Voices. Movement. The sound of the storm outside.

But here—in this quiet space between the shelves—it was just them.

Just Sam, looking at Eben with something that might have been disappointment.

And Eben, realizing exactly what he'd done.

"I have to fix this," Eben said quietly.

"Yes. You do."

"I don't know how."

"You'll figure it out." Sam's voice was firm. "Because the alternative is losing him. And I don't think you can live with that."

Eben looked toward the front of the warehouse.

Toward where Noel was. Somewhere in the crowd. Smiling. Working. Pretending.

"No," Eben said quietly. "I can't."

---

Sam studied him for a long moment.

Then: "Good. Because Noel deserves someone who fights for him. Someone who chooses him. Even when it's scary. Even when it's hard."

Silence.

"Do you?" Sam's eyes were sharp. "Because from where I'm standing, you chose fear. You chose your walls. You chose to run."

More silence. Eben couldn't answer. The truth sat heavy in his chest.

"So the question is—" Sam's voice was quiet. Deliberate. "What are you going to choose now?"

---

Eben didn't have an answer.

Not yet.

But he knew—absolutely knew—that he couldn't keep choosing fear.

Couldn't keep choosing his walls.

Couldn't keep running from the one thing that actually mattered.

"I'm going to fix this," he said again.

Sam nodded. "When?"

"Tomorrow. Christmas Eve."

"Why not now?"

"Because—" Eben gestured toward the warehouse. The crowd. The event. "Because he's not ready. He told me—he said 'not today.'"

Sam's expression shifted. Something softer. "He said that?"

"Yes. When I tried to talk to him earlier. He said 'not today. Please.'" Eben's throat tightened. "His voice cracked on 'please.'"

"Jesus," Sam said quietly.

Eben nodded.

"You really did a number on him."

Another nod.

Sam sighed. "Okay. Tomorrow. Christmas Eve. You apologize. You explain. You tell him the truth."

"What if he doesn't believe me?"

"Then you keep trying. You keep showing up. You keep choosing him. Until he does."

"And if he doesn't want me back?"

Sam looked at him steadily. "Then you live with it. Because that's the consequence of what you did. And you don't get to run from consequences."

Eben nodded slowly.

Sam was right.

He was always right.

That was the problem.

---

They walked back toward the front of the warehouse.

The event was in full swing. People browsing donation items. Volunteers organizing. The charity tree haul happening despite the storm.

Eben scanned the crowd.

Found Noel.

He was near the far wall, talking to a vendor. Smiling. Gesturing. Looking perfectly fine.

Except—

Except Eben knew that smile.

Knew what it meant.

Knew that underneath it, Noel was breaking.

And it was Eben's fault.

---

As if sensing his gaze, Noel looked up.

Their eyes met across the warehouse.

For a moment, everything stopped.

Noel's smile faltered. Just slightly. Just enough for Eben to see the hurt underneath.

Then someone called Noel's name.

He turned away.

And Eben stood there, in the middle of his empty warehouse, surrounded by people, and thought: *I did this.*

*I broke him.*

*And I have to fix it.*

---

Sam's words echoed in his head.

*You're destroying something before it can hurt you.*

*What are you going to choose now?*

Eben looked around the warehouse.

At the space he'd built. The systems he'd created. The walls he'd constructed.

All of it designed to keep people out.

To keep himself safe.

To keep from needing anyone.

And it had worked.

For years, it had worked.

He'd been safe. Protected. Invulnerable.

And completely, utterly alone.

Until Noel.

---

Noel, who'd slipped past every defense Eben had.

Who'd made him laugh. Made him care. Made him want to stay.

Who'd looked at all of Eben's sharp edges and careful distance and said: *I see you. And I'm not going anywhere.*

Who'd trusted Eben with his wounds. His fears. His carefully hidden vulnerabilities.

Who'd said *I love you* first.

And Eben had destroyed it.

Had taken that trust and broken it.

Had said the worst possible thing and watched Noel's face go blank.

Had chosen fear over love.

Walls over connection.

Safety over everything that mattered.

---

The storm raged outside.

Rain pounding against the roof. Wind howling. Thunder in the distance.

Inside, the warehouse was warm. Bright. Full of people.

But Eben felt cold.

Empty.

Alone.

Even with Noel twenty feet away.

Especially with Noel twenty feet away.

Because the distance between them wasn't physical.

It was the distance Eben had created.

The wall he'd built.

The choice he'd made.

And he didn't know how to tear it down.

---

But he had to try.

Tomorrow.

Christmas Eve.

He'd apologize. Explain. Tell Noel the truth.

*I was scared. I didn't mean it. I love you. I'm choosing you.*

*Please give me another chance.*

And if Noel said no—

If Noel couldn't forgive him—

Then Eben would live with it.

Would accept the consequence of what he'd done.

Would spend the rest of his life knowing he'd destroyed the best thing that ever happened to him.

Because he'd been too scared to keep it.

---

The storm continued.

The event continued.

And Eben stood in his warehouse, watching Noel across the room, and thought: *Tomorrow.*

*I'll fix this tomorrow.*

*I have to.*

Because the alternative—

The alternative was unacceptable.
