## Chapter 8: Hook Ending

**Day 10, Dec 23 — Night**

**NOEL**

The day ended at sunset.

Another event finished. Ten down, two to go.

People headed home, tired but cheerful. Vendors packed up. Volunteers waved goodbye until tomorrow.

Noel stood in the square and felt—

Nothing.

Empty.

Like he'd used up everything he had just getting through the day.

And now there was nothing left.

---

The crowd thinned.

People heading home. Getting ready for the final stretch.

Two more days of festival. Then it would really be over.

And Noel—

Noel didn't know what to do.

Didn't know where to go.

Didn't know how to exist in a world where he didn't have an excuse to see Eben anymore.

---

He helped with cleanup.

Because that's what he did.

Made himself useful. Stayed busy. Didn't think.

Packed boxes. Folded tables. Organized donations.

Moved on autopilot.

Smiled when people thanked him.

Said "you're welcome" and "happy holidays" and "see you next year."

Lied.

Over and over.

Until the lies felt like the only truth he had left.

---

The square emptied.

Just a few stragglers left. The cleanup crew. The people who stayed until the end.

Noel was one of them.

Always one of them.

The person who stayed. Who helped. Who made sure everything was taken care of.

Even when he was breaking.

Especially when he was breaking.

---

"Noel."

Hugh's voice. Quiet. Concerned.

Noel turned.

Hugh was standing there, holding a box of decorations, looking at Noel with something that might have been worry.

"You okay?" Hugh asked.

"Yeah," Noel said automatically. "Just—tired."

"That's not what I meant."

"I'm fine, Hugh."

"You're not fine." Hugh set down the box. "You haven't been fine for days. And I—" He paused. "I'm worried about you."

Noel's throat tightened.

"I'm fine," he said again.

But his voice cracked.

Just slightly.

Just enough.

---

Hugh stepped closer.

"What happened?" he asked quietly. "With you and Eben?"

"Nothing."

"Noel—"

"Nothing happened. We're fine. Everything's fine."

"You're lying."

"I'm not—"

"You are." Hugh's voice was gentle. Kind. "And I get it. I get that you don't want to talk about it. But—" He paused. "You don't have to pretend with me. You don't have to be fine."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Because Noel did have to be fine.

Had to pretend.

Had to keep the mask on.

Because if he let it slip—

If he let people see—

They'd know.

They'd know how completely he'd fallen apart.

How much he'd let himself hope.

How devastatingly wrong he'd been.

---

"I'm fine," Noel said one more time.

Hugh looked at him for a long moment.

Then sighed. "Okay. But if you need anything—"

"I know. Thanks."

Hugh walked away.

And Noel stood there, alone in the emptying square, and thought: *I'm not fine.*

*I'm breaking.*

*And I don't know how to stop.*

---

He finished cleanup.

Packed the last box. Folded the last table. Turned off the last string of lights.

The square was dark now.

Empty.

Silent.

The festival was over.

And Noel—

Noel had nothing left.

No more events. No more excuses. No more reasons to smile.

Just—

Nothing.

---

He walked to his car.

Got in.

Sat there, hands on the wheel, and stared at the empty square.

Tomorrow was Christmas Eve.

The day after that, Christmas.

And Noel would go back to—

What?

His empty apartment? His cold bed? His silent life?

The thought made him want to scream.

---

Noel started the car.

Drove home through the dark streets.

The town was quiet. Peaceful. Everyone resting up for Christmas Eve tomorrow.

And Noel was alone.

The way he'd always been.

The way he'd always known he would be.

---

The apartment was silent.

Noel stood in the doorway with his keys still in his hand, like he'd forgotten what came next.

This was his life.
Cold air. Quiet rooms. The hum of the fridge pretending it was company.

He went to the bedroom and sat on the edge of the mattress instead of lying down. The empty side stared back at him.

His wrist itched.

The ribbon.

Bright red, stupidly cheerful, cutting into skin that didn't deserve to be marked up for a promise that hadn't held.

Noel hooked a nail under the knot.

Pulled.

The bow loosened.

His breath hitched so hard it hurt.

He froze with the ends in his fingers, as if letting go would make the whole week evaporate. As if the second it came off, Eben would become a dream Noel had invented to survive December.

*Maybe he was right,* Noel thought.
*Maybe it was never supposed to last.*

The thought didn't come with a scream. It came with a quiet, lethal certainty.

His hands shook.

He didn't take the ribbon off.

He couldn't.

Not yet.

Noel curled forward, elbows on his knees, ribbon ends dangling from his wrist like a torn flag.

And in the dark, alone where no one could see the mask slip, he made a sound he would have denied existed in him.

One broken breath.

Then another.

Then the sob that finally found him.

The ribbon stayed.

So did the proof.
