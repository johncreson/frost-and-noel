## BLURB

He's never been this alone.

Eben Frost is back in Chicago. Back to the life he thought he wanted—clean contracts, empty apartments, no attachments to break.

It's efficient. It's safe. It's everything he used to tell himself was enough.

It's miserable.

Three days without Noel. Three days of replaying their fight. Three days of realizing that "temporary" was never what he wanted—he was just too scared to admit it.

Meanwhile, in Tinsel Town, Noel is falling apart. The festival is still happening. The town still needs him. But the smile doesn't reach his eyes anymore, and everyone can see it.

Two men. Two cities. One devastating mistake.

**Day ten of twelve. Rock bottom is where you finally see clearly.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring separation, rock bottom realization, grumpy-sunshine dynamics, and a guaranteed happy ending.*
