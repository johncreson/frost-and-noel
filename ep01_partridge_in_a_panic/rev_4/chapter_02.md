# Chapter 2: First Meeting

Eben Frost did not believe in chaos.

Chaos was just order that hadn't been properly categorized yet.

The Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic, however, was testing that theory with malicious enthusiasm.

Eben stood in the doorway, leather gloves still on, and conducted his assessment. Fourteen vendors in various states of logistical meltdown. Booth placement violated basic traffic flow principles—a bottleneck waiting to happen. Volunteer coordination appeared to be a rumor. Someone had brought a terrier that was eyeing a buffet table. And there was a man in a cape made of silver tinsel who was the loudest thing in the room.

And in the center of it all—

Eben's gaze snagged on him immediately.

The event coordinator. Noel Merrick. The briefing files hadn't specified that the man in charge was currently holding himself together with nothing but caffeine and what looked like pure, unadulterated spite.

Noel was the eye of the storm. Mid-twenties, rumpled, smiling like someone who had learned the expression from a textbook.

It almost worked.

Eben watched him handle three separate crises in ninety seconds. Redirected a vendor. Soothed a mounting argument. Produced tape from thin air to fix a falling banner.

Efficient. Competent. Drowning.

This was a man holding a falling world together by sheer stubborn refusal to let go.

"Mr. Frost!" Mayor Kringle appeared at his elbow, vibrating with anxiety. "You made it! Wonderful! Let me introduce you to—"

"The event coordinator." Eben didn't look up from his clipboard. "Noel Merrick."

"Yes! How did you—"

"Process of elimination. He's the only one directing traffic. Everyone else is just reacting."

Mayor Kringle beamed. "Exactly! Which is why we need you. Noel's wonderful, absolutely wonderful, but he's been doing this alone and—well. You'll see."

Eben had already seen. The question wasn't whether Noel needed help, but whether he would accept it without Eben having to dismantle his pride first.

"Does he know I'm coming?"

Mayor Kringle's smile flickered. "I... mentioned it."

"When?"

"Just now. Via text."

Eben closed his eyes briefly. "So you've sent me in as an ambush."

"He knows there's help! He just doesn't know it's... well, you. Specifically. Yet."

"I'll introduce you!" Mayor Kringle said, and before Eben could suggest a more strategic approach, the mayor was already halfway across the floor.

Eben followed.

Up close, Noel Merrick looked worse. Not bad—objectively, a very handsome man—but worn thin. Like a coat that had been through one too many winters.

"Noel! This is Eben Frost. He's the help I mentioned!"

Noel's smile didn't waver, but Eben saw the steel slam down behind his eyes.

"Help." Noel repeated the word like a defeat.

"Logistics consultant. The mayor hired me to assist with festival operations."

"I'm handling the operations."

"I'm sure you are. The mayor felt a second set of hands might be useful."

"I have hands." Noel held them up. They were shaking. "Two of them. Fully functional."

"They're vibrating."

"Caffeine."

"Exhaustion."

The mayor made a strangled sound. "Well! I'll just let you two get acquainted! Eben, Noel will show you around. Noel, Eben is here for the full twelve days, so—"

"Twelve days." Noel made it sound like a prison sentence.

"Merry Christmas!" Mayor Kringle fled.

Silence stretched between them. Noel's smile finally cracked—not broke, but shifted into something sharper.

"I didn't ask for help."

"I'm aware."

"I don't need help."

"Also aware."

"Then why are you here, Frost?"

Eben decided on the blunt truth. It was more efficient than tact.

"Because the mayor is panicking. Because the festival is understaffed. And because you've been awake for thirty-seven hours and you're currently the single point of failure for this town's holiday season."

"Thirty-seven? How did you—"

"Bags under your eyes. Timestamp on your last file upload."

Noel's mouth tightened. "Accuracy is just one word for being an asshole, Frost."

"In my experience, it's the only word that matters when the alternative is collapse."

Noel stared at him. Eben waited.

"Then be accurate," Noel said finally. "Just don't expect me to like it."

"I don't. I expect you to survive."

Eben began to pull off his gloves. One finger at a time. He watched Noel's eyes track the movement, lingering on his bare skin for a beat too long.

"Where do you want me?"

Noel's expression did something complicated. "Anywhere that's not directly in my way."

"I'll do my best."

He meant it as a promise. But as he looked at the exhaustion lining Noel's face, he realized that staying out of the way was going to be the hardest part of the job.

Because this was temporary. It had to be.
