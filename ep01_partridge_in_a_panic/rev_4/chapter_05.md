# Chapter 5: First Crack

The inflatable snowman incident had been resolved with minimal property damage and maximum emotional fallout.

Eben stood in the dim, cool air of the storage room behind Merryweather Hall. The scent of burnt vinyl still hung in his nostrils.

He'd been hired for logistics. He had not been hired for flaming holiday décor, partridge containment, or managing an event director who treated every failure like a personal indictment.

And yet.

Eben pulled off his leather gloves. One finger at a time. A familiar ritual that marked the boundary between performance and existence.

The festival was chaos. Noel Merrick was chaos in human form—a man made of caffeine and a desperate need to be the one who fixed everything.

Eben should hate this. He should be counting down to his flight.

He was remembering the way Noel's hand had felt against his sleeve in the middle of the glitter-storm.

This was a problem.

Better to stay on the edges. Better to be the temporary solution than the permanent loss.

Better to keep his gloves on.

He looked at his bare hands. Flexed his fingers against the cold.

The door creaked open.

Eben didn't look up immediately. He knew that stride. Frantic but trying to be light.

Noel stood in the doorway, backlit by fluorescent hum. The mask had slipped, leaving something raw and tired. He looked like a man who had finally realized the world wouldn't end if he stopped smiling.

"Sorry. I didn't know anyone was in here. I just needed—" He gestured toward the shelving.

"Extension cords."

Noel's laugh was startled. Genuine. "The snowman incident. That's what we're calling it?"

"More professional than 'The Great Vinyl Meltdown.'"

"Adds a layer of dignity to the failure." Noel stepped into the room. His eyes caught on Eben's hands.

Eben should put the gloves back on.

He didn't.

"Long day."

"Eleven more to go." Noel leaned against a stack of boxes, his shoulders finally dropping.

"Twelve isn't so many."

"You really believe that?"

"It's a finite period. Beginning, middle, end. Manageable."

"And after the end?"

"Fewer with two people."

Noel's expression shifted. Something soft and dangerously close to trust. "Fewer with two."

Silence. Thick. Charged.

Eben was aware of the three feet between them. The coffee stain on Noel's collar. The speck of silver glitter caught in his dark hair.

"You're good at this."

"At what?"

"At fixing things. At being the stabilizer." Noel looked at his own hands. "You came in here and in six hours, you made everything work. You handled the fire. You handled me."

"I didn't handle you, Noel."

"You made it so I didn't have to do it all alone. I'm not used to that."

"I noticed."

"Is it that obvious?"

"You treat every crisis like a personal failure. It's inefficient."

Noel laughed, short and sharp. "I'm lovable when I'm useful, Eben. If I'm not the one fixing the snowman, what am I?"

Eben looked at him. The vulnerability. The breach of protocol.

"You're the person this town loves regardless of the snowman."

"How do you know that? You've been here for six hours."

"The pattern is that everyone looks to you not just for the schedule, but for the permission to be happy. That has nothing to do with whether the lights work."

Noel was quiet for a long beat.

"That's a lot of pressure."

"It is. Which is why you need help."

"Temporary help."

The word landed between them.

"Temporary."

Noel's expression flickered. "Then Chicago."

"That's the job."

Noel pushed off the boxes, his mask clicking back into place. "I should get those cords."

"Noel—"

"Thanks. For the analysis." He paused in the doorway. "You're not what I expected, Frost."

"Cold and distant?"

"Contained. There's a difference." His gaze dropped to Eben's hands. "You should put your gloves back on. It's freezing in here."

He left.

Eben stood alone. He looked at his bare hands—vulnerable, human.

Slowly, he pulled his gloves back on. One finger at a time.

It didn't help.

He just had to survive wanting to stay in a place he had no business belonging to.
