# Chapter 3: Competence Clash

Noel was going to kill Mayor Kringle.

Not immediately. He had a festival to run, and the paperwork for a homicide would be a logistical nightmare. But eventually. With something festive. Maybe a sharpened candy cane.

He watched Eben Frost cross the hall toward the vendor area. The man moved with a measured precision that suggested he'd never stumbled on a patch of ice in his entire life.

"He looks like he alphabetizes his cereal," Noel muttered, taking a desperate gulp of cold coffee. "And judges people who don't."

The worst part—the absolutely infuriating part—was that the machine was already working. Eben had known about the permits. He'd known about the sound system. He'd apparently absorbed Noel's sleep-deprived briefing files and turned them into a tactical strategy.

"Noel!" Wes appeared at his elbow, holding a coffee cup the size of a small bucket. "Brought reinforcements."

"You're a saint, Wes." Noel accepted the cup, the heat seeping into his chilled fingers.

"I'm really not." Wes nodded toward the far side of the hall where Eben was speaking to Marcus at the candle booth. "So. That's the help."

"Apparently."

"He looks intense."

"He looks like he's conducting an autopsy on my life choices."

"I was going to say 'sharp,' but sure." Wes leaned against the wall. "How long before you two either kiss or commit a felony?"

Noel choked on his coffee. "What? No. Felony, maybe. The other thing? Absolutely not."

"Uh-huh." Wes's smile was a weapon. "He's been staring at you for ten minutes."

"He's been in the building for ten minutes total, Wes. He's assessing the room."

"He's looking at you like you're a puzzle. Trust me."

Noel refused to look. "You're delusional."

"I'll be at the bakery if you need me. Try not to set anything on fire."

"That was one time!"

"It was three times, and the fire marshal has your picture on a dartboard."

Wes left. Noel stood alone, fuming.

He turned toward the storage room.

And nearly collided with a wall of charcoal wool.

"Jesus! Do you have to haunt the hall like a Victorian ghost?"

"I walked normally." Eben's voice was steady as a glacier. "You were distracted."

"I was paying attention to the ninety-three things on my list."

"None of which are currently on fire."

"Give it twenty minutes. Hugh is here."

Eben's expression didn't change, but his eyes tightened. "The vendor placement issue is resolved."

"You can't just move booths, Frost. People have contracts—"

"They have a bottleneck that violates fire code. I explained the physics. They were both satisfied with the new arrangement once they realized it would double their visibility."

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it. He'd been planning to handle that. He'd had a whole speech prepared.

"You're welcome."

"I didn't thank you."

"I noticed."

Noel's jaw tightened. "The sign-in sheets. Where are they?"

"Second shelf. Left side. Behind the tinsel."

"How did you find them? I looked for twenty minutes."

"I looked logically."

Noel brushed past him into the storage room. He found the sheets exactly where Eben said. He stood in the dim light, the paper crinkling in his hand.

For the first time in years, somebody else was holding the weight.

It should have been a relief.

When he emerged, Eben was already reorganizing the check-in table. Three distinct stations: Badge Distribution, Assignment Cards, Emergency Contact. Beautiful. Surgical. Annoying.

"This is elaborate."

"It's efficient." Eben didn't look up.

"Don't let the power go to your head, Frost. It's just badges."

"Badges represent identity and authorization. They are the metadata of the festival."

"We're a holiday festival in Tinsel Town, not a tech summit."

"Everything is a system. Regardless of how much glitter you apply."

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice boomed across the room. "We have a glitter emergency!"

"Is anyone bleeding, Hugh?"

"Not physically! But my artistic integrity is hemorrhaging!"

"I'll handle the glitter." Eben stepped away from the table.

"You? You hate glitter."

"I recognize its properties as a messy, invasive substance. Which is why I will manage it with a containment strategy while you finish the volunteer briefing."

Noel wanted to argue. But Eben was already moving toward Hugh with a determined, clinical air.

"Fine. But if you get a single speck on that coat, don't blame me."

"I won't."

Noel watched him go. Eben Frost was cold, arrogant, and had the social warmth of a frozen pond. But as Noel looked at the organized check-in table, he felt a strange sensation in his chest.

He wasn't drowning anymore.

He was just floating. And he wasn't sure if he liked the view.
