# Chapter 4: Town Watches

By noon, the focus of the Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic had shifted from the tinsel-covered rafters of Merryweather Hall to the icy expanse of Evergreen Square.

Noel stood at the edge of the fountain and tried to remember why he'd thought a twelve-day celebration of human endurance and holiday clichés was a good idea.

The square was a masterpiece of organized disaster. Wooden booths spiraled out from the center. Strings of lights lay in tangled heaps. And in the very middle, a massive Colorado Spruce stood tall, its branches currently bare and appearing resentful of the proximity to so much glitter.

"It'll come together," Noel whispered to the frost on his breath.

"Magic is an unreliable variable in a project timeline."

Noel didn't even jump this time. "You're going to have to stop doing that, Eben. People will start thinking the square is haunted by a well-dressed spirit of Christmas judgment."

"I walk normally." Eben scanned the hot cocoa station placement. "You don't have a coat on."

"I have a sweater. It's festive."

"It's wool. Not windproof. You're shivering."

"I'm handling it."

Wes appeared with a tray of cinnamon-dusted pastries and steaming cups. "Reinforcements! I brought sustenance for the survivors."

Wes turned to Eben. "Wes Candle. I run the bakery. I also know everyone's secrets, but I only trade them for quality spreadsheets."

"Eben Frost. Logistics."

"The man Mayor Kringle hired to save Noel from himself. How's the rescue mission going?"

Noel felt the familiar prickle. "I don't need saving, Wes. I need the inflatable snowman to stop leaking air."

"I've already patched the snowman." Eben sipped his coffee. "I'm here to ensure the systems remain functional for the contract duration."

"Contract." Wes caught Noel's eye. "So. Temporary."

"Twelve days." Eben added. "Then Chicago. Clean entry, clean exit."

Wes laughed. "Good luck with the 'clean exit' part. Tinsel Town tends to be sticky."

"Sticky is just a lack of proper cleaning protocols."

Wes turned to go. "Try not to set anything on fire, Noel!"

"It was three times, Wes!"

They stood in silence as Wes disappeared into the crowd.

"The town *is* watching." Eben looked around the square.

Noel could see them—vendors, volunteers, families setting up shop. All watching the man who had been their anchor for five years. And watching the stranger beside him.

"They're watching because they want to know if they're safe," Eben said. "People in a community like this rely on their leaders for stability."

"You think I'm a leader? I thought you think I'm a failure of resource management."

"A leader who is currently failing at resource management is still a leader. It just means the leader needs a better support system."

"And that's you?"

"I'm the logistics. The system is the system." Eben adjusted his clipboard. "I'll handle the tree lighting crew. You go deal with the Mayor. He's explaining the 'spirit of Christmas' to a confused electrician."

"NOEL!" Mayor Kringle waved from across the square. "The power grid—it's not festive! It's making a humming noise!"

"On it."

The next three hours were a blur of escalating festive panic. The inflatable snowman started listing left with a slow, mournful hiss. A vendor brought three dozen live partridges because they'd "misinterpreted the theme."

And then there was the glitter.

Hugh arrived with a literal cannon. "It's a sparkle surge, Noel! To bless the square!"

"Hugh, don't—"

*FOOMP.*

A cloud of silver glitter erupted into the freezing air, coating everything within fifty feet. Beautiful for exactly three seconds. Then the wind picked up.

Noel found himself standing in a blizzard of sparkle. He felt Eben beside him, and for a wild moment, his hand brushed Eben's sleeve. The fabric was cold, but the arm underneath was solid.

"Basic resource allocation." Eben muttered it under his breath, but he didn't move away.

"We're sparkly, Frost." Noel laughed. "Competently sparkly."

"I am not sparkly. I am merely reflecting light."

And then, it happened.

A small popping sound from the inflatable snowman. A larger pop.

"Is that... smoke?"

Noel's eyes widened. "THE SNOWMAN IS ON FIRE!"

"NOBODY PANIC!" Hugh screamed, which was the universal signal for everyone to lose their minds.

The snowman began to melt in a spectacular, flaming puddle. The sharp, acrid scent of burnt vinyl choked the air—a smell that would haunt the square for a month.

Noel ran toward the fire extinguisher, but a gloved hand caught his arm.

"I have it."

Eben didn't run. He walked with purpose. Reached the extinguisher, pulled the pin, and neutralized the flaming Frosty with clinical efficiency.

Noel stood there, heart hammering, watching Eben return the extinguisher to its stand.

The town was watching. And they weren't looking at Noel. They were looking at the man who had just saved the square.

"Clean execution." Eben returned to Noel's side. "The snowman was defective. I'll file the insurance claim."

Noel looked at the melted puddle and then at the faces of his neighbors.

"Thanks."

"Now, we have eleven more hours until the opening. We should probably move the partridges."

Noel followed him, the weight of "temporary" feeling heavier with every step.
