# Chapter 8: Hook Ending

The hall was quiet.

Eben stood in the center of Merryweather Hall and listened to the silence. It was cold and hollow, missing the frantic energy of the day.

Just the two of them.

Across the room, Noel was hunched over the volunteer schedule for tomorrow. The harsh fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, washing out the warmth in his face—a stark contrast to the diamond-glow of the square six hours ago.

Eben should leave. His contract for Day One was complete. Systems were stable. Equipment secured.

He didn't move.

"I think that's everything." Noel looked up, his voice stripped of its performer's charm.

"The permits are finalized. Volunteer schedule optimized. Emergency protocols in place."

"So we're done."

"For today."

Silence. Heavier than before.

Noel set down his clipboard with a clatter. He crossed the floor, stopping at the three-foot boundary.

The distance felt like a failure of geometry.

"Tomorrow."

"Tomorrow."

"Same time?"

"I'll be here."

Noel blinked. "You don't have to be. I've done the morning setup for years."

"I don't do things out of obligation, Noel. I do them because they are necessary for the project."

"And I'm part of the project?"

"You are the center of it."

Noel looked at him, his gaze heavy and searching. "That sounds like you care about the person, Frost. Not just the data."

The warning system tightened in Eben's chest.

"I care about the outcome."

"Right. The outcome." Noel laughed quietly. "Eleven more days of outcomes. Then you leave."

"That is the arrangement."

"Back to the clean exits. Back to the apartment that isn't a home."

"It's efficient."

"Efficiency isn't the same as living, Eben."

"Then analyze why you're still standing here instead of going to your hotel."

Eben didn't have an answer that fit into a spreadsheet. He was standing here because leaving Noel alone in this hollow hall felt like a logistical catastrophe.

"This is temporary."

"I know."

"Then you leave, and I go back to being the one this town needs. Alone."

"You have the town. You have Wes. Hugh."

"I have a lot of people who need me, Eben. That's not the same as having someone who stays."

The honesty breached every boundary Eben had built. He wanted to close the distance. He wanted to say *I'll stay*.

He didn't.

Because everything ended. Every project closed.

"I should go."

"Six AM. Don't be late."

"I'm never late, Frost. I'm just spiritually delayed."

Noel smiled then—soft, tired, devastating.

Eben walked out without looking back.

The winter air hit him like a blow. He sat in his car and stared at the dark windshield. Looked at his leather gloves—the armor he'd put back on the moment they left the sound booth.

"Temporary."

The word didn't mean anything anymore.

Eleven days.

It shouldn't have felt like a deadline.

It did.
