# Chapter 1: Cold Open

Noel Merrick had been awake for thirty-seven hours and was handling it fine.

This was a lie, but it was a festive lie, so it was legally tax-deductible.

The Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic was Tinsel Town's holy grail, and right now, the fluorescent lights of the hall buzzed overhead like angry wasps. His coffee had gone cold somewhere around crisis number twelve.

"Noel!" A vendor waved frantically from across the main floor. "The sound system's doing the thing again!"

The thing where it worked perfectly during testing and then developed a death rattle the moment anyone actually needed it.

"On it." The smile clicked into place—a reflex honed by a lifetime of making sure nobody saw the cracks. He crossed the hall in purposeful strides, though his knees felt like they were held together by aging rubber bands and holiday prayers.

Five forty-seven AM. Still dark outside. The festival launched in four hours and thirteen minutes. Noel had approximately ninety-three problems to solve, half of which were currently hidden in the shadows, waiting to pounce.

His hands shook a little as he crouched beside the sound board. He tucked them into his pockets until the tremor subsided. Just the cold. December in Tinsel Town didn't mess around.

"It's making a clicking sound." Marcus—who ran the candle booth and always smelled faintly of unburnt wick—hovered at his shoulder. "Like a... click. Click. Click."

"I've noticed." Noel smiled wider, the professional mask anchored by pure spite.

Loose cable. A simple, manageable failure.

"Try it now." He tightened the connection.

Marcus flipped a switch. Clean sound poured through the speakers.

"You're a miracle worker. I don't know what this town would do without you, Noel."

Noel's chest did something complicated. *What would he be, if he wasn't the one everyone needed?*

"Just doing my job."

He stood, his vision swimming for a second. His phone buzzed three times. The rhythm of impending doom.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Noel! Quick question!*
**Mayor Kringle:** *Did we file the vendor permits for Evergreen Square?*
**Mayor Kringle:** *Because I'm looking at the system and I'm not seeing them and I'm sure it's just a glitch but—*

Noel's stomach dropped.

The permits.

He remembered the kitchen table. The glow of the laptop. He'd been right there, cursor hovering over the 'Submit' button, when Mrs. Henderson had called about the wreath delivery catastrophe. He'd tabbed away, and then—the world had kept spinning.

"Excuse me." Noel nodded to Marcus, the smile still locked in place.

He walked very calmly toward the storage room. He made it three steps past the door before he braced both hands on a stack of boxes and allowed himself exactly five seconds of silent, screaming panic.

One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

He straightened. His reflection in a nearby window looked like a ghost that had been through a car wash.

He dialed the permit office. Voicemail. Of course. It was 5:50 AM. Normal people were still tucked under duvets.

His phone buzzed again.

**Wes Candle:** *Saw your car in the lot. Coffee?*
**Noel:** *Yes. Please. IV drip if possible.*
**Wes:** *On it. Also you look like death. Just FYI.*
**Noel:** *Festive death.*
**Wes:** *The best kind.*

Noel pocketed his phone and returned to the main hall. The chaos had multiplied in his absence. The volunteer coordinator had lost the sign-in sheets. Two vendors were currently engaged in a heated debate over whose booth was more "spiritually aligned" with the entrance. Someone's terrier—Sprinkles—was investigating the buffet with a professional's focus.

And then there was Hugh.

Hugh Everhart swept into the building wearing what appeared to be a cape made entirely of silver tinsel. He looked like an aggressive disco ball.

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice echoed through the rafters. "Crisis averted! The ribbon shipment arrived!"

"That's great, Hugh—"

"It's the wrong color!"

Of course it was.

"How wrong?" Noel shielded his eyes from the tinsel-glare.

"Chartreuse instead of forest green." Hugh held up a spool, his expression tragic. "Do you know what chartreuse does to a holiday palette, Noel? It's a crime. A festive felony."

"We'll fix it."

"You're a saint!" Hugh swept away in a rustle of metallic fringe.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Also! Quick thing! I arranged some help for you!*

Noel stared at the screen. The word 'help' felt like an insult. 'Help' meant he wasn't handling it. 'Help' meant the cracks were showing.

**Noel:** *What kind of help?*
**Mayor Kringle:** *You'll see! Should be there soon! Merry Christmas!*

He caught Sprinkles, returned the dog to a frantic vendor, and was mid-explanation about the spiritual alignment of booth placement when the main doors groaned open.

A draft of freezing winter air sliced through the stale warmth of the hall, carrying the sharp scent of cold pine and impending judgment.

Noel looked up.

The man in the doorway was a stark contrast to the colorful, glitter-stained chaos surrounding him. Tall. Charcoal coat tailored to the millimeter. He held a clipboard like a tactical map.

He scanned the room—the bickering vendors, Hugh's tinsel cape, the dog hair on Noel's trousers—with the clinical detachment of a surgeon about to begin a difficult operation.

Then his eyes landed on Noel.

Noel, who was currently covered in dog hair and running on thirty-seven hours of desperation.

The man didn't smile. He just assessed. Cold. Precise.

Noel hated him instantly.

The stranger walked toward him with a measured, rhythmic gait. He stopped exactly three feet away—the precise boundary of professional distance.

"Can I help you?" Noel's smile was strained but holding.

"I'm here to help you."

His voice was a low, steady baritone. Like ice.

"I'm handling it."

The stranger's gaze flickered to the chaos behind Noel. To the ticking sound system, the missing sheets, the chartreuse ribbons. Then back to Noel's bloodshot eyes.

"That's one word for it."

And Noel knew, with the sinking certainty of a man who'd just hit a very festive iceberg, that this was going to be a very long twelve days.
