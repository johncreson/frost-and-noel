# Chapter 6: Working Together

**NOEL**

They'd developed a rhythm.

It was the way Eben would already be holding the ladder before Noel realized he needed to reach the top strand of lights. The way Noel would finish explaining something to a vendor, and Eben would be standing there with the exact form that needed signing.

Efficient. Seamless. Destabilizing.

"Left side needs more slack." Eben called from across the square. The 8 PM launch was only four hours away.

Noel adjusted the light strand. "Better?"

"Perfect."

*Perfect.* The word hit like a weight. If Eben was the precision, what was Noel? Just the glitter?

"Noel!" A volunteer waved from the edge of the square. "Where do you want the cocoa station?"

Noel opened his mouth.

"Northeast corner." Eben appeared beside him. "Best proximity to the seating area. Puts the heaters at the windward side."

"What he said."

The volunteer left, looking more confident.

"You have opinions about cocoa station thermodynamics."

"I have opinions about the conservation of energy."

"I'm starting to think you enjoy Being Right."

Eben's mouth twitched. "Being right is just a byproduct of good data."

"I'd appreciate it if you were occasionally wrong. For my ego."

"I'll take it under advisement."

They stood side by side, watching the square transform. The tree was a pillar of unlit potential. The booths were orderly.

"We did this."

"You did the vision." Eben didn't look away from the tree. "I handled the physics."

"We did it together, Eben. Don't audit the credit."

Eben was quiet. Then: "Together."

Something warm unfurled in Noel's chest.

"I should check the sound board."

"I checked it twenty minutes ago."

"I should check it anyway."

"Why?"

*Because I need to not be standing three inches away from you. Because you smell like winter and cedar.*

"Professional thoroughness."

Eben didn't believe the lie. But he didn't challenge it.

Noel fled toward the stage.

**EBEN**

Noel was avoiding him.

It was strategic. A sudden need to audit things that didn't need auditing. A careful preservation of distance.

Eben was doing the same thing.

He found himself anticipating Noel's needs with precision that felt like vulnerability. He knew when Noel was about to trip. He knew when his caffeine had worn off.

"Mr. Frost?" A volunteer approached. "We're not sure about the banner placement."

"Shift it three feet left and raise it eighteen inches. Visible from the highway without catching crosswinds."

"That makes sense!"

Eben wasn't thinking about the banner. He was watching Noel across the square, laughing with Wes, head tilted back in the dying sunlight.

"Eben!"

Noel jogged toward him. "We have a problem."

"What kind?"

"The mayor wants a photo op. With 'The Team.' For the town website."

"No."

"I told him no! He's got the photographer already."

"I don't do public relations."

"Look at him." Noel pointed toward the center of the square, where Mayor Kringle was bouncing on his feet. "He's so excited he might actually pop."

Eben looked at Noel. The exhaustion lining his face.

"One photo."

"Really?"

"One. Then I retreat into the shadows."

"Deal."

They walked toward the mayor. Side by side. Eben found himself matching Noel's stride without thinking.

"Just stand together!" Mayor Kringle beamed. "Look competent! Festive!"

"We're Being Right." Noel muttered it just for Eben.

The photographer snapped the picture.

"Wonderful! You look like you've been working together for years!"

Nine hours. But it felt like a system that had always been in place.

They escaped the mayor's enthusiasm.

"Eleven more days." Noel didn't move away.

The word *temporary* hung between them—a lie they were both using to protect themselves.

And as Eben stood in the falling snow, he knew he was in significant logistical trouble.

Because for the first time in ten years, he didn't want a clean exit.
