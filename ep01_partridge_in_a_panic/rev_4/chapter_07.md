# Chapter 7: Evening Save

The lights came on at exactly eight PM.

Noel stood at the edge of Evergreen Square and watched the transformation. One moment, construction zone. The next, magic.

Thousands of tiny white lights blazed to life with a single, synchronized *click*. The lights reflected off the fresh snow like scattered diamonds. The tree glowed like a beacon. Even the replacement snowman—which Eben had personally vetted—looked noble in the golden glow, its top hat secured by a thick bow of chartreuse ribbon.

The chartreuse was hideous. A crime against holiday tradition. But in the glow of the square, it looked like a victory lap.

The crowd gasped. Then applauded.

Noel's chest did something complicated. *One down. Eleven to go.*

"It's beautiful." Mrs. Henderson squeezed his arm. "I don't know where we'd be without you, Noel."

"Just doing my job."

The thought should have been enough. Tonight, it felt like a cage.

"Noel."

Eben was standing three feet away, charcoal coat stark against the festive backdrop. "We have a problem."

"What kind?"

"The sound system. Main amplifier is cutting out."

"I thought you checked it twice."

"I did. It was stable twenty minutes ago." Eben looked at the crowd, then back at Noel. "I can bypass the circuit, but I can't hold the board steady and reach the wiring at the same time."

"You're asking me for help?"

"I need someone I trust."

Noel froze. Eben had known him for less than fifteen hours, and he was using that word as if it meant everything.

"Show me."

They moved through the crowd together. Eben led him behind the stage to the cramped sound booth.

"The connection is loose. I need you to hold the board while I re-seat the terminals."

"That's it?"

"I need someone I trust."

Noel braced his shoulder against the heavy board. They were close. Close enough to feel the heat radiating from Eben's body. Close enough to smell the cedar and cold-pine.

Eben's hands moved with focused efficiency. No gloves. His fingers were long and sure.

"Almost there."

"Done."

Eben didn't move away immediately. They stayed there for a beat too long.

"Test it."

Noel flipped the switch. Clean sound poured through the speakers.

"Perfect."

"Perfect."

They both stepped back. Eben reached for his gloves. Armor back in place.

"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO DAY ONE OF THE MERRYWEATHER TWELVE DAYS OF MAGIC!"

Mayor Kringle's voice boomed across the square. The crowd roared.

Noel and Eben moved to the edge of the stage. Side by side. Not touching.

"You did it."

"We did it."

"A functional partnership."

Noel looked at Eben. The man who treated attachment like a system error but who had just said *I trust you* in a dark sound booth.

*I don't want this to be temporary.*

"Long day." Eben kept his gaze on the lights.

"Ten more to go."

"Eleven."

"Right. One down." Noel laughed. "Eleven more days of Being Right."

"And then?"

"Then you leave. And I go back to handling it."

Eben just watched the snow fall. "Yes. That's the system."

But as the lights reflected in Eben's dark eyes, Noel knew the system was already failing.

Because for the first time in his life, Noel Merrick didn't want to be 'fine.'

He wanted to be *stays*.
