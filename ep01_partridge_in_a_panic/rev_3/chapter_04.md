# Chapter 4: Town Watches

By noon, the focus of the Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic had shifted from the humid, tinsel-covered rafters of Merryweather Hall to the icy expanse of Evergreen Square.

Noel stood at the edge of the fountain and tried to remember why he’d thought a twelve-day celebration of human endurance and holiday cliches was a good idea. 

The square was a masterpiece of organized disaster. Wooden booths spiraled out from the center like a slow-motion car crash. Strings of lights lay in tangled heaps on the frozen ground, looking like the shed skins of electric snakes. And in the very middle, a massive Colorado Spruce stood tall, its branches currently bare and appearing somewhat resentful of the proximity to so much glitter.

"It'll come together." Noel whispered to the frost on his breath. "The magic just... hasn't been applied yet."

"Magic is an unreliable variable in a project timeline." 

Noel didn't even jump this time. He just sighed. "You're going to have to stop doing that, Eben. It’s bad for the local morale. People will start thinking the square is haunted by a very well-dressed spirit of Christmas judgment."

"I walk normally." Eben scanned the placement of the hot cocoa station. "The square is naturally acoustic. You’re just—"

"Exhausted? Vibrating? Failing?"

"I was going to say ‘unprotected.’" Eben looked at him then, his eyes dark and unreadable. "You don't have a coat on."

"I have a sweater. It’s festive."

"It’s wool. It’s not windproof. You’re shivering."

"I'm handling it."

"That appears to be your answer to everything. Regardless of the physics involved." 

Before Noel could retort that physics were a secondary concern during a holiday crisis, Wes appeared with a tray of cinnamon-dusted pastries and three steaming cups of something that smelled like heaven and heavy cream.

"Reinforcements!" Wes stepped over a stray length of garland. "I brought sustenance for the survivors. And I see we have a new addition to the Tinsel Town landscape."

Wes turned to Eben, his eyes gleaming with the sharp curiosity that made him the town's unofficial information broker. "Wes Candle. I run the bakery. I also know everyone’s secrets, but I only trade them for high-quality spreadsheets."

"Eben Frost." Eben shook Wes’s hand with a single, efficient pump. "Logistics. And I don’t deal in secrets. Only data."

"Same thing, really. So. The man that Mayor Kringle hired to save Noel from himself. How’s the rescue mission going?"

Noel felt the familiar prickle of irritation. "I don't need saving, Wes. I need the inflatable snowman to stop leaking air."

"I've already patched the snowman." Eben sipped his coffee. "And I'm not here for a rescue mission. I'm here to ensure the internal systems remain functional for the duration of the contract."

"Contract." Wes caught Noel’s eye. "So. Temporary."

"Extremely." Noel said it a little too quickly. 

"Twelve days." Eben added. "Then I leave for Chicago. Clean entry, clean exit."

Wes watched them like a spectator at a tennis match. "Chicago. Right. Well, good luck with the 'clean exit' part. Tinsel Town tends to be a bit... sticky."

"Sticky is just a lack of proper cleaning protocols."

"See?" Noel gestured at Eben. "He’s a delight. He treats human emotion like a spill in aisle four."

Wes just laughed and turned to go. "Try not to set anything on fire, Noel! The town is watching!"

"It was three times, Wes! And the fire marshal said it was a 'statistical anomaly'!"

They stood in silence for a moment as Wes disappeared into the crowd of volunteers. 

"The town *is* watching." Eben looked around the square. 

Noel could see them—the vendors, the volunteers, the families setting up shop. They were all watching him. They were watching the man who had been their anchor for five years. And they were watching the stranger standing beside him. 

The weight of it felt heavier than usual. *I'm lovable when I’m useful,* Noel thought, the mantra a dull ache in his chest. *If I'm not the one fixing everything, who am I to them?*

"They're watching because they want to know if they're safe." Eben said it as if he’d read the tension in Noel’s shoulders. "People in a community like this rely on their leaders for stability. They see you as the stability."

"You think I'm a leader? I thought you think I'm a 'failure of resource management.'"

"A leader who is currently failing at resource management is still a leader. It just means the leader needs a better support system."

"And that’s you? The support system?"

"I'm the logistics. The system is the system." Eben adjusted his clipboard. "I'll handle the tree lighting crew. You go deal with the Mayor. He’s currently explaining the 'spirit of Christmas' to a very confused electrician."

"NOEL!" Mayor Kringle waved from across the square, looking like an anxious marshmallow in his white puffer jacket. "Noel, we have a problem! The power grid is—it’s not festive! It’s making a humming noise!"

"On it." Noel called out, the smile clicking back into place. 

The next three hours were a blur of escalating festive panic. The inflatable snowman—the one Eben had supposedly patched—started listing to the left with a slow, mournful hiss. A vendor brought three dozen live partridges because they’d "misinterpreted the theme," and the birds were currently staging a occupy protest in the main tent. 

And then there was the glitter. 

Hugh had arrived with a literal cannon. "It’s a sparkle surge, Noel! To bless the square!"

"Hugh, don't—"

*FOOMP.*

A cloud of silver glitter erupted into the freezing air, coating everything within a fifty-foot radius. It was beautiful for exactly three seconds. Then the wind picked up.

Noel found himself standing in a blizzard of sparkle. He felt Eben beside him, and for a wild moment, he reached out, his hand brushing Eben’s charcoal sleeve. The fabric was cold, but the arm underneath was solid. A mountain in the middle of a glitter-storm.

"Basic resource allocation." Eben muttered it under his breath, but he didn't move away. 

"We're sparkly, Frost." Noel laughed, a hysterical bubble rising in his throat. "We're competently sparkly."

"I am not sparkly. I am merely reflecting light."

And then, it happened.

A small popping sound from the base of the inflatable snowman. A larger pop. 

"Is that... smoke?"

Noel’s eyes widened. "THE SNOWMAN IS ON FIRE!"

"NOBODY PANIC!" Hugh screamed, which was the universal signal for everyone to lose their minds.

The snowman began to melt in a spectacular, flaming puddle of synthetic vinyl and holiday dreams. The sharp, acrid scent of burnt plastic and chemical pine choked the air—a smell that would haunt the square for a month.

Noel ran toward the fire extinguisher, but he felt a hand on his arm—firm, steady, and wearing a leather glove.

"I have it." 

Eben didn't run. He walked with a purpose. He reached the extinguisher, pulled the pin, and neutralized the flaming Frosty with a clinical efficiency that left the square in a stunned, glittery silence.

Noel stood there, heart hammering, watching Eben return the extinguisher to its stand. 

The town was watching. And they weren't looking at Noel. They were looking at the man who had just saved the square.

"Clean execution." Eben returned to Noel’s side, brushing a final speck of glitter off his coat. "The snowman was defective. I'll file the insurance claim."

Noel looked at the puddle of melted snowman and then at the faces of his neighbors. He felt a sharp, cold hollow opening up inside him. 

"Thanks. Fixed again."

"Just linguistics. Now, we have eleven more hours until the opening. We should probably move the partridges."

Noel followed him, the weight of the "temporary" lie feeling heavier with every step. Eben was here to fix the festival. But Noel was starting to worry that he was the thing that needed fixing the most.
