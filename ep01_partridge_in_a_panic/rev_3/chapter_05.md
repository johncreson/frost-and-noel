# Chapter 5: First Crack

The inflatable snowman incident had been resolved with minimal property damage and maximum emotional fallout.

Eben stood in the dim, cool air of the storage room behind Merryweather Hall and listened to the silence. It was a reprieve from the square, where the scent of burnt vinyl and aggressive glitter still hung in his nostrils, a persistent reminder of the day's instability.

He’d been hired for logistics. He had not been hired for flaming holiday decor, partridge containment, or managing an event director who treated every failure like a personal indictment of his character. 

And yet.

Eben pulled off his leather gloves. One finger at a time. It was a familiar, grounding ritual that marked the boundary between the performance of efficiency and the reality of existence. He watched his own hands—bare, slightly pale—as if they belonged to someone else.

The Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic was chaos. Noel Merrick was chaos in human form—a man made of caffeine, light, and a desperate, driving need to be the one who fixed everything.

Eben should hate this. He should be counting down the minutes until his flight to Chicago. 

He was not counting. He was remembering the way Noel's hand had felt against his sleeve in the middle of the glitter-storm. A brief, steadying connection that had felt more like a grounding wire than a disruption.

This was a problem.

Eben had built his entire adult life on a single principle: clean execution. Get in, fix the systems, get out before anyone noticed you were there. Before you became a part of the landscape. 

Before you became something that could be missed.

Attachment was a promise to lose something. Eben had learned that lesson in the echoes of a quiet house and the sight of packed boxes. Better to stay on the edges. Better to be the temporary solution than the permanent loss.

Better to keep his gloves on.

He looked at his bare hands. Flexed his fingers, feeling the bite of the winter air that had seeped into the building. 

The door creaked open.

Eben didn't look up immediately. He knew the rhythm of that stride. Frantic but trying to be light. Exhausted but refusing to drag.

Noel stood in the doorway, backlit by the hall's fluorescent hum. He looked... real. The "I’m fine" mask had slipped, leaving behind something raw and fundamentally tired. He looked like a man who had finally realized the world wouldn't end if he stopped smiling for five minutes.

Eben preferred it.

"Sorry. I didn't know anyone was in here. I just needed—" Noel gestured toward the industrial shelving.

"Extension cords."

Noel’s laugh was startled. Genuine. "The snowman incident. That's what we're calling it?"

"It’s more professional than ‘The Great Vinyl Meltdown,’ don't you think?"

"Much more. Adds a layer of dignity to the failure." Noel stepped into the room. His eyes caught on Eben's hands. He stopped, his gaze lingering on the bare skin—bare of the leather, bare of the armor.

Eben should put the gloves back on. He should reclaim the system. 

He didn't. 

"Long day."

"Eleven more to go." Noel leaned against a stack of boxes, his shoulders finally dropping an inch. His sweater brushed against the cold cardboard with a soft, sliding sound.

"Twelve isn't so many."

"You really believe that, don't you? That twelve days is nothing."

"It's a finite period. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. That makes it manageable."

"And after the end?" 

"Fewer with two people."

Noel's expression shifted. The tension in his jaw relaxed, replaced by something soft and dangerously close to trust. "Fewer with two," he agreed.

The silence that followed wasn't the empty silence Eben was used to. It was thick. Charged. Eben was aware of the three feet of space between them. He could see the coffee stain on Noel’s collar, the way a single speck of silver glitter had hooked into his dark hair. 

He wanted to reach out and brush it away. He wanted to close the distance.

Eben didn't move.

"You're good at this."

"At what? Reorganizing storage rooms?"

"At fixing things. At being... the stabilizer." Noel looked down at his own hands, his fingers interlaced tightly. "You came in here and in six hours, you made everything work. You handled Marcus, you handled Hugh, you handled the fire. You handled me."

"I didn't handle you, Noel."

"You did. You made it so I didn’t have to do it all alone. I don't... I’m not used to that."

"I noticed."

"Is it that obvious?"

"You treat every crisis like a personal failure of your character. It’s a very inefficient way to live."

Noel laughed, a short, sharp sound that didn't have any humor in it. "I’m lovable when I’m useful, Eben. If I’m not the one fixing the snowman, what am I?"

Eben looked at the younger man—really looked at the vulnerability he was exposing. It was a breach of protocol. A breakdown of the system.

"You're the person this town loves regardless of the snowman." It was the truth, but saying it felt like a betrayal of his own distance.

"How do you know that? You've been here for six hours."

"I’m an analyst, Noel. I observe patterns. The pattern in Tinsel Town is that everyone looks to you not just for the schedule, but for the permission to be happy. That has nothing to do with whether the lights work."

Noel was quiet for a long beat. "That’s a lot of pressure."

"It is. Which is why you need help."

"Temporary help."

The word landed between them like a physical barrier. The reminder of the system. The promise of the exit.

"Temporary."

Noel’s expression flickered. "Right. Eleven days. Then you go back to Chicago or wherever the next 'clean exit' is."

"That's the job."

"And I go back to managing the sparkle-surges on my own." Noel pushed off the boxes, his mask clicking back into place with a speed that made Eben’s chest ache. "I should get those cords. The mayor is probably vibrating again."

"Noel—"

"Thanks. For the analysis." Noel reached for the cords, his movements quick and professional once more. He paused in the doorway, looking back over his shoulder. "You're not what I expected, Frost."

"Cold and distant?"

"Contained. There's a difference." Noel's gaze dropped to Eben's hands one last time. "You should put your gloves back on. It’s freezing in here."

He left before Eben could respond.

Eben stood alone in the cool darkness. He looked at his bare hands—vulnerable, human, and for the first time in a decade, feeling the absence of a touch he hadn't even received.

Slowly, deliberately, he pulled his gloves back on. One finger at a time. The leather was cold. The armor was heavy.

It didn't help. 

The system was compromised. Noel Merrick had walked through the "temporary" lie like it was made of tinsel and glitter. 

Eben closed his eyes. Eleven days. He just had to survive eleven days of wanting to stay in a place he had no business belonging to. 

"Temporary." 

But as he walked out of the storage room, he knew the data was already beginning to suggest otherwise.
