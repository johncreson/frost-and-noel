# Chapter 3: Competence Clash

Noel was going to kill Mayor Kringle.

Not immediately. He had a festival to run, and the paperwork required for a homicide would be a logistical nightmare. But eventually. With something festive. Maybe a sharpened candy cane or a particularly heavy wreath.

He watched Eben Frost cross the hall toward the vendor area. The man moved with a rhythmic, measured precision that suggested he’d never stumbled on a patch of ice or a loose cable in his entire life. He was a machine in a charcoal coat.

"He looks like he alphabetizes his cereal," Noel muttered, taking a desperate gulp of cold coffee. It was a bitter, metallic shock that matched the "accuracy" Frost had just used to dismantle Noel's dignity. "And judges people who don't."

The worst part—the absolutely infuriating part—was that the machine was already working. Eben had known about the permits. He’d known about the sound system rattle. He’d apparently absorbed Noel's sleep-deprived briefing files and turned them into a tactical strategy while Noel was still trying to remember where he’d parked his car.

Competent. The man was terrifyingly competent. And for someone like Noel, who lived and breathed being the one who solved everyone’s problems, that competence felt like a direct assault on his nervous system.

"Noel!" Wes appeared at his elbow, holding a coffee cup the size of a small bucket. "Brought reinforcements for the front lines."

"You're a saint, Wes. Truly." Noel accepted the cup, the heat of it seeping into his chilled, shaking fingers. 

"I'm really not. I just want to make sure you're upright for the opening ceremony." Wes nodded toward the far side of the hall where Eben was speaking to Marcus at the candle booth, which already smelled of unburnt wick and impending prosperity. "So. That's the help."

"Apparently."

"He looks... intense."

"He looks like he's conducting an autopsy on my life choices."

"I was going to say 'sharp,' but sure." Wes leaned against the brick wall, arms folded. He watched the hall with the air of a man settling in for a very entertaining show. "How long do you give it before you two either kiss or commit a felony?"

Noel choked on his coffee, the hot liquid burning his throat. "What? What are you—no. Felony, maybe. The other thing? Absolutely not. We have mutual irritation. That's it."

"Uh-huh." Wes’s smile was a weapon. "He's been staring at you for ten minutes, Noel."

"He's been in the building for ten minutes total, Wes. He’s assessing the room. I’m part of the room."

"He’s looking at you like you’re the most interesting puzzle he’ve ever seen. Trust me. I know the look."

Noel refused to look. He gripped his coffee cup and focused on a distant light fixture. "You're delusional. He thinks I'm a failure of resource management. He told me so."

"And yet, he hasn't looked away." Wes pushed off the wall. "I'll be at the bakery if you need me. Try not to set anything on fire today."

"That was one time! And the snowman was defective!"

"It was three times, and the fire marshal has your picture on a dartboard." 

Wes called the last bit back over his shoulder. Noel stood alone, fuming. He was *fine*. He was the event director. He didn’t need clinical puzzles or intense staring or "help" from a man who treated human interaction like a spreadsheet.

He turned toward the storage room, intent on finding the backup lanterns.

And nearly collided with a wall of charcoal wool.

"Jesus! Do you have to haunt the hall like a Victorian ghost?"

"I walked normally." Eben’s voice was as steady as a glacier. "You were distracted."

"I was paying attention to the ninety-three things currently on my list."

"None of which are currently on fire."

"Give it twenty minutes. Hugh is here."

Eben's expression didn't change, but the slight tightening around his eyes suggested he’d already cataloged Hugh as a significant risk factor. "The vendor placement issue is resolved."

"What? You can't just move booths, Frost. People have contracts. They have—"

"They have a bottleneck that violates fire code." Eben interrupted with the flat certainty of a judge. "I explained the physics of the crowd flow to them. They were both satisfied with the new arrangement once they realized it would double their visibility. No one is blocking the emergency exits anymore."

Noel opened his mouth to argue, then closed it. He’d been planning to handle that. He’d had a whole speech prepared about community cooperation. Eben had just used physics.

"You're welcome."

"I didn't thank you."

"I noticed. Your gratitude seems to be as depleted as your glycogen levels."

"I'm fine." It was a reflex now.

"You're vibrating." Eben’s gaze dropped to Noel’s hands. "Go sit down for ten minutes."

"I have sign-in sheets to find."

"Second shelf. Left side. Behind the extra tinsel."

Noel stared at him, his jaw tight. "How did you find them? I looked for twenty minutes this morning."

"I looked logically."

Of course. Logic. The magic ingredient Noel had apparently forgotten in his thirty-eight hours of wakefulness.

Noel brushed past him into the storage room. He found the sheets exactly where Eben said they would be. He stood in the dim light for a moment, the paper crinkling in his hand. For the first time in years, somebody else was holding the weight.

It should have been a relief. Instead, it felt like being replaced. Like being told he wasn't needed anymore—which, in Noel’s world, was a fate worse than the fire marshal’s dartboard.

When he emerged, Eben was already reorganizing the check-in table. He’d created three distinct stations: Badge Distribution, Assignment Cards, and Emergency Contact. It was beautiful. It was surgical. It was incredibly annoying.

"This is... elaborate." Noel set the sheets down.

"It's efficient." Eben didn't look up from his clipboard.

"Don't let the power go to your head, Frost. It's just badges."

"Badges represent identity and authorization. They are the metadata of the festival."

"Metadata? We're a holiday festival in Tinsel Town, not a tech summit."

"Everything is a system, Noel. Regardless of how much glitter you apply to it."

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice boomed from across the room. "We have a glitter emergency! It’s a level five sparkle disaster!"

"Is anyone bleeding, Hugh?"

"Not physically! But my artistic integrity is hemorrhaging!"

"I'll handle the glitter." Eben stepped away from the table.

"You? You hate glitter. You just called it 'system noise.'"

"I don't hate it. I recognize its properties as a messy, invasive substance. Which is why I will manage it with a controlled containment strategy while you finish the volunteer briefing. This is basic resource allocation."

Noel wanted to argue. He wanted to be the one to save Hugh from his own drama. But Eben was already moving toward Hugh with a determined, clinical air.

"Fine. But if you get a single speck on that coat, don't blame me."

"I won't."

Noel watched him go. Eben Frost was cold, arrogant, and had the social warmth of a frozen pond. But as Noel looked at the perfectly organized check-in table, he felt a strange, nagging sensation in his chest.

He wasn't drowning anymore.

He was just floating. And he wasn't sure if he liked the view.

"Temporary." Noel gripped his coffee cup. "He's only here for twelve days. Then I go back to being the one this town needs."

But as he watched Eben calmly explain the structural properties of glitter to a hysterical Hugh, Noel wasn't sure if he wanted to wait that long.
