# Chapter 6: Working Together

**NOEL**

They’d developed a rhythm.

It was a terrifying, beautiful thing that Noel hadn’t seen coming. It was the way Eben would already be holding the ladder before Noel realized he needed to reach the top strand of lights. It was the way Noel would finish an explanation to a disgruntled vendor, and Eben would be standing there with the exact form that needed signing.

Efficient. Seamless. And for Noel, fundamentally destabilizing.

"Left side needs more slack." Eben called from across the square. He was adjusting the rigging for the main stage, his movements a masterclass in economy. The 8 PM launch was only four hours away, and the weight of the deadline was beginning to thrum in the air.

Noel adjusted the light strand, the cable cold against his numb palms. "Better?"

"Perfect."

The word hit Noel like a physical weight. *Perfect.* Because that was what they were—a set of gears that finally had enough oil to move without grinding. 

*I'm usually the one who makes things perfect,* Noel thought, watching Eben move. *If he’s here to be the precision, what am I? Just the glitter?*

"Noel!" A volunteer waved from the edge of the square, where the scent of hot cocoa and cinnamon was beginning to overcome the lingering smell of burnt vinyl. "Where do you want the station and the extra heaters?"

Noel opened his mouth to answer, his brain already calculating the foot traffic from the main gate.

"Northeast corner." Eben appeared beside him with the suddenness of a mountain fog. "Best proximity to the seating area without obstructing the view of the tree. Also, it puts the heaters at the windward side to maximize heat retention."

"What he said." Noel’s voice was a little flatter than intended.

The volunteer left, looking much more confident than she had ten seconds ago.

"You have opinions about cocoa station thermodynamics."

"I have opinions about anything involving the conservation of energy."

"I'm starting to think you just enjoy Being Right."

Eben’s mouth twitched—a micro-expression that Noel was learning to recognize as amusement. "I enjoy systems that work, Noel. Being right is just a byproduct of good data."

"I’d appreciate it if you were occasionally wrong. For the sake of my ego."

"I'll take it under advisement."

They stood side by side, watching the square transform. The tree was a pillar of unlit potential. The booths were orderly. It looked like a town that was ready to celebrate, not a town that was about to implode.

"We did this."

"You did the vision." Eben didn't look away from the tree. "I just handled the physics."

"We did it together, Eben. Don't audit the credit."

Eben was quiet for a moment. He looked at Noel, his gaze lingering on the dark circles under Noel’s eyes. "Yes. Together."

Something warm and dangerous unfurled in Noel’s chest. A sense of partnership that he hadn’t felt in years. *Fewer with two,* Eben had said. 

"I should check the sound board."

"I checked it twenty minutes ago. It’s calibrated."

"I... should check it anyway."

"Why?"

*Because I need to not be standing three inches away from you,* Noel thought. *Because you smell like winter and cedar and I’m noticing the way your coat fits your shoulders.*

"Professional thoroughness." Noel’s smile clicked back into place.

Eben’s gaze didn't waver. He didn't believe the lie, but he didn't challenge it. "As you wish."

Noel fled toward the stage, his heart hammering a rhythm that had nothing to do with the festival.

**EBEN**

Noel was avoiding him. 

It was a strategic withdrawal, executed with the charm of a professional. A sudden need to audit things that didn't need auditing. A careful preservation of the four-foot boundary between them. 

Eben understood. He was doing the same thing. 

He found himself anticipating Noel’s needs with a precision that was beginning to feel like a vulnerability. He knew when Noel was about to trip over a cable. He knew when Noel’s caffeine had worn off. He knew which vendors made Noel’s smile go brittle.

It was an attachment he hadn’t authorized. 

"Mr. Frost?" A volunteer approached, looking slightly intimidated by his clipboard. "We're not sure about the banner placement."

Eben followed her to the main entrance. "Shift it three feet to the left and raise it eighteen inches. It’ll be visible from the highway entrance without being caught in the crosswinds."

"Oh! That makes sense. You really have an eye for this."

"It’s basic spatial reasoning." Eben’s mind wasn't on the banner. 

He was watching Noel across the square. Noel was laughing with Wes, his head tilted back, the dying sunlight catching the warmth in his face. It was a beautiful sight, and Eben hated how much it made him want to stay.

"Eben!"

He turned. Noel was jogging toward him, looking slightly breathless. 

"We have a problem."

"What kind? Logistics or personality?"

"The mayor. He wants a photo op. With 'The Team.' For the town website."

Eben’s stomach sank. "No."

"I told him no! I told him you were a 'logistics ghost.' He said ghosts don't increase tourism revenue. He’s got the photographer already."

"I don't do public relations, Noel."

"I know. But look at him." Noel pointed toward the center of the square, where Mayor Kringle was bouncing on the balls of his feet. "He’s so excited he might actually pop. And after today... I don't have the energy to fight him."

Eben looked at Noel. Really looked at the exhaustion lining his face. He saw the way Noel was leaning toward him, just slightly, as if seeking a center of gravity.

"One photo."

"Really?"

"One. Then I retreat into the shadows."

"Deal."

They walked toward the mayor. Side by side. Eben found himself matching Noel’s stride without thinking. 

"Perfect!" Mayor Kringle beamed, gesturing them into place in front of the tree. "Just stand together. Look competent! Look festive! Look like the men who saved the Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic!"

"We're just ensuring the launch integrity."

"We’re Being Right." Noel muttered it just for Eben. 

The photographer snapped the picture. 

"Wonderful! You two look like you've been working together for years!"

Eben looked at Noel. They’d been working together for nine hours. But it felt like a system that had always been in place. A rhythm that had been waiting for its second half.

"Can we go now?" 

"Yes, yes! Thank you, boys! The town is going to love this!"

They escaped the mayor’s enthusiasm, retreating toward the quieted edge of the square. 

"The town is going to love it. The 'Team.'"

"It’s a functional partnership. For twelve days."

"Eleven now." Noel didn't move away. 

Eben looked at the lights twinkling across the square—unlit, but ready. At the snow that had begun to fall in soft, silent flakes, coating the charcoal of his coat in a fine white dust. At the man standing beside him who had no idea how much Eben wanted to make day one last forever.

"Eleven more days."

"Temporary." 

"Temporary."

The word was a lie they were both using to protect themselves from the reality of how much it was going to hurt when the twelve days were up. And as Eben stood in the falling snow, he knew he was in significant logistical trouble. 

Because for the first time in ten years, he didn't want a clean exit.
