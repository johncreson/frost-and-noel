# Chapter 1: Cold Open

Noel Merrick had been awake for thirty-seven hours and was handling it fine.

This was a lie, but it was a festive lie, so it counted.

The Merryweather Hall's fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like angry wasps, which was appropriate, because Noel felt like he'd been stung approximately forty-seven times in the last six hours alone. His coffee had gone cold somewhere around crisis number twelve. He'd lost track after that.

"Noel!" A vendor waved frantically from across the main floor. "The sound system's doing the thing again!"

The thing. Yes. The thing where it worked perfectly during testing and then developed a death rattle the moment anyone actually needed it.

"On it," Noel called back, smile firmly in place, and crossed the hall in what he hoped looked like purposeful strides rather than the caffeinated stumble it actually was.

Five forty-seven AM. Still dark outside. The festival didn't officially start until ten, which meant he had exactly four hours and thirteen minutes to solve approximately ninety-three problems, half of which he didn't know existed yet.

He could do this.

He was *fine*.

His hands only shook a little as he crouched beside the sound board, and that was probably just the cold. December in Tinsel Town didn't mess around. The hall's heating system was older than most of the volunteers, and about as reliable.

"It's making a clicking sound," the vendor—Marcus, ran the candle booth—said helpfully. "Like a... click. Click. Click."

Noel resisted the urge to point out that yes, clicking sounds did tend to go *click*. Instead, he smiled wider and checked the connections.

Loose cable. Of course.

"Should be good now," he said, tightening it. "Try it?"

Marcus flipped a switch. Clean sound poured through the speakers.

"You're a miracle worker," Marcus said, relief flooding his face.

Noel's chest did something complicated. Warm and tight and *necessary*.

"Just doing my job," he said, and meant it in ways that probably required therapy to unpack.

He stood, knees protesting, and his phone buzzed in his pocket. Three times. Which meant either someone was very excited or something was very wrong.

Historically, in Noel's life, it was always the latter.

He pulled out his phone.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Noel! Quick question!*

**Mayor Kringle:** *Did we file the vendor permits for Evergreen Square?*

**Mayor Kringle:** *Because I'm looking at the system and I'm not seeing them and I'm sure it's just a glitch but—*

Noel's stomach dropped somewhere in the vicinity of his shoes.

The permits.

The permits he'd *definitely* filed. Two weeks ago. He remembered doing it. He'd been at his kitchen table, laptop open, form filled out, submit button clicked—

Except.

Except he'd gotten a call halfway through. Mrs. Henderson, panicking about the wreath delivery. And he'd tabbed away to check the schedule, and then—

Oh no.

"Excuse me," Noel said to Marcus, smile still locked in place, and walked very calmly toward the storage room.

He made it three steps past the door before he braced both hands on a stack of boxes and allowed himself exactly five seconds of silent, screaming panic.

One.

Two.

Three.

Four.

Five.

He straightened. Pulled out his phone. Dialed the permit office.

Voicemail. Of course. It was 5:50 AM. Normal people weren't awake yet.

Normal people also didn't run twelve-day holiday festivals that the entire town depended on for tourism revenue and general Christmas spirit.

Noel was *fine*.

He'd fix this. He always fixed things. That was what he *did*. That was what made him—

Useful.

Valuable.

Worth keeping around.

His phone buzzed again.

**Wes Candle:** *Saw your car in the lot. Coffee?*

Noel could have kissed him. Platonically. Gratefully. Desperately.

**Noel:** *Yes. Please. IV drip if possible.*

**Wes:** *On it. Also you look like death. Just FYI.*

**Noel:** *Festive death.*

**Wes:** *The best kind.*

Noel pocketed his phone and returned to the main hall, where approximately six new problems had sprouted like particularly aggressive weeds.

The volunteer coordinator couldn't find the sign-in sheets. Two vendors were arguing about booth placement. Someone's dog had gotten loose and was currently investigating the buffet table with great enthusiasm. And Hugh Everhart had just entered the building in what appeared to be a cape made entirely of silver tinsel.

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice carried across the hall like a glittery foghorn. "Crisis averted! The ribbon shipment arrived!"

"That's great, Hugh—"

"It's the wrong color!"

Of course it was.

"How wrong?" Noel asked, already crossing toward him.

"Chartreuse instead of forest green." Hugh held up a spool like it had personally offended him. "Do you know what chartreuse does to a color palette?"

"Crimes against Christmas?" Noel guessed.

"*Exactly.*"

Noel added it to the mental list. Permits. Sound system (fixed). Dog (ongoing). Ribbons (catastrophic, apparently). Volunteers (missing). His own will to live (debatable).

"I'll call the supplier," he said.

"You're a saint," Hugh declared, and swept away in a cloud of tinsel and drama.

Noel's phone buzzed.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Also! Quick thing! I arranged some help for you!*

Noel stared at the message.

Help.

He didn't need help. He needed permits and sleep and possibly a vacation, but he didn't need *help*. He had this under control.

Mostly.

Technically.

**Noel:** *What kind of help?*

**Mayor Kringle:** *You'll see! Should be there soon! Merry Christmas!*

That was ominous.

Noel didn't have time for ominous.

He pocketed his phone, grabbed the runaway dog (a terrier named Sprinkles, because of course), returned her to her apologetic owner, and was halfway through explaining the booth placement situation when the main doors opened.

Cold air rushed in.

And someone new stepped through.

Noel looked up.

The man in the doorway was tall. Neat. Wearing a charcoal coat that probably cost more than Noel's car, and he held a clipboard like it was a weapon.

He looked at the chaos of Merryweather Hall—the scattered volunteers, the arguing vendors, Hugh's tinsel cape, the dog situation—with the expression of someone conducting a very thorough autopsy.

Then his eyes landed on Noel.

Noel, who hadn't slept in thirty-seven hours. Noel, whose shirt was wrinkled and whose hair was doing something unforgivable. Noel, who was smiling so hard his face hurt because that was what you did when everything was falling apart.

The man's expression didn't change.

But something in his eyes did.

Assessment, Noel thought. Cold. Clinical.

He hated it immediately.

The man walked toward him with the kind of deliberate precision that suggested he'd measured the distance first.

"Can I help you?" Noel asked, smile firmly in place.

The man stopped exactly three feet away. Close enough to be professional. Far enough to avoid any actual warmth.

"I'm here to help you," the man said.

His voice was winter itself. Crisp. Clean. Controlled.

Noel's smile didn't waver.

"I'm handling it," he said.

The man looked at the chaos again. The vendors. The dog. Hugh, who was now arguing with someone about glitter density.

Then he looked back at Noel.

"That's one word for it," he said.

And Noel knew, with the certainty of someone who'd been running on spite and caffeine for thirty-seven hours straight, that this was going to be a very long twelve days.
