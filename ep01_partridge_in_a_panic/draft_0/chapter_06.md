# Chapter 6: Working Together

**NOEL**

They'd developed a rhythm.

Noel wasn't sure when it happened. Somewhere between the snowman incident and the light rigging crisis. Somewhere between Eben handing him coffee without being asked and Noel knowing exactly which clipboard Eben needed before he asked for it.

It was efficient.

It was dangerous.

"Left side needs more slack," Eben called from across the square.

Noel adjusted the light strand. "Better?"

"Perfect."

Perfect. Right. Because they were perfect at this. At working together. At moving through the chaos like they'd choreographed it.

This is fine, Noel thought. This is just efficiency. We're just efficient.

"Noel!" A volunteer waved. "Where do you want the hot cocoa station?"

Noel opened his mouth to answer.

"Northeast corner," Eben said, appearing beside him. "Better traffic flow. Closer to the seating area."

"What he said," Noel agreed.

The volunteer left.

Noel looked at Eben. "You have opinions about cocoa station placement."

"I have opinions about everything."

"I've noticed."

"Is that a problem?"

"It's..." Noel searched for the word. "Unexpected."

"You expected me to be less opinionated?"

"I expected you to be less right about everything."

Eben's mouth twitched. "I'll try to be wrong occasionally. For variety."

"I'd appreciate that."

They stood side by side, watching the square transform. Booths were complete. Lights were strung. The tree was upright and decorated. It actually looked like a festival.

It actually looked like it might work.

"We did this," Noel said quietly.

"You did most of it."

"We did it together."

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "Yes. We did."

Something warm unfurled in Noel's chest. Something dangerous and inconvenient and absolutely not allowed.

He shoved it down.

"I should check on the sound system," Noel said.

"I checked it twenty minutes ago. It's fine."

"I should check it anyway."

"Why?"

Because I need to not be standing next to you right now, Noel thought. Because you smell like winter and something clean and I'm noticing it and that's a problem.

"Professional thoroughness," Noel said.

"Uh-huh."

Eben definitely didn't believe him.

Noel fled anyway.

**EBEN**

Noel was avoiding him.

Eben knew the signs. The sudden need to check things that didn't need checking. The careful maintenance of physical distance. The way Noel's smile clicked into place whenever they got too close.

Eben understood.

He was doing the same thing.

They were both very good at avoidance.

"Mr. Frost?" A volunteer approached. "We're not sure about the banner placement."

Eben followed her to the main entrance, where two volunteers were debating the merits of various hanging angles.

"Higher," Eben said. "And shift it three feet left. Better sight lines from the street."

They adjusted. It was perfect.

"You're really good at this," one of the volunteers said.

"It's basic spatial reasoning."

"It's more than that. You just—see things. How they should be."

Eben didn't know how to respond to that.

He'd always seen things. Patterns. Systems. The way pieces fit together. It was how his mind worked. How he'd survived.

How he'd stayed alone.

"Thank you," he said finally.

The volunteer smiled and left.

Eben stood alone, looking at the banner. The festival. The town square transformed into something magical.

He'd done this. With Noel.

They'd done this together.

The thought should have been neutral. Professional.

It wasn't.

"Eben!"

He turned. Noel was jogging toward him, slightly breathless.

"We have a problem," Noel said.

"What kind of problem?"

"The good kind. The mayor wants to do a photo op. With both of us. For the town website."

Eben's stomach sank. "Both of us."

"Apparently we're 'the team that saved the festival.'" Noel's expression was complicated. "I tried to tell him it was premature, but he's already got the photographer."

"I don't do photo ops."

"I told him that. He said 'everyone does photo ops.'"

"I'm not everyone."

"I noticed." Noel's smile was wry. "But he's the mayor. And he's excited. And honestly, after today, I don't have the energy to argue."

Eben looked at him. Really looked.

Noel was exhausted. Running on fumes. But there was something else in his eyes now. Something that hadn't been there this morning.

Hope.

"Fine," Eben said.

"Really?"

"One photo. Then I'm done."

"Deal."

They walked toward where Mayor Kringle was setting up with a photographer. Side by side. Close enough that their arms almost brushed.

Eben was very aware of the distance.

Very aware of how easy it would be to close it.

"Just stand together!" Mayor Kringle directed. "Look competent! Festive! Competently festive!"

"That's not a thing," Noel muttered.

"We're making it a thing," Eben muttered back.

Noel laughed. Quiet. Genuine.

The photographer snapped the picture.

"Perfect!" Mayor Kringle beamed. "You two are naturals!"

"We're really not," Noel said.

"Nonsense! You work together beautifully! Like you've been doing this for years!"

They'd been doing this for eight hours.

Eight hours that felt like longer. Like something that had weight. Like something that mattered.

Eben didn't like how much it mattered.

"Can we go now?" he asked.

"Yes, yes! Thank you! This is wonderful! The town will love this!"

They escaped.

**NOEL**

The evening rush hit like a tidal wave.

Last-minute vendor questions. Volunteer coordination. Equipment checks. A thousand tiny details that needed handling before tomorrow's opening.

Noel handled them.

With Eben.

They moved through the chaos like dancers. Noel would start toward a problem, and Eben would already be solving it. Eben would need something, and Noel would have it ready.

It was seamless.

It was terrifying.

"Extension cord," Eben said, hand out.

Noel handed it to him without looking.

"How did you know I needed that?" Eben asked.

"You were looking at the light strand. It's too short. Extension cord was the logical next step."

"That's very logical of you."

"I'm learning from the master."

Eben's expression did something complicated. "I'm not a master."

"You're something."

Their eyes met.

Held.

Noel forgot what he was going to say.

"Noel!" Hugh appeared like a glittery comet. "Final ribbon approval needed!"

The moment broke.

Noel turned away, heart doing something irregular in his chest.

This was fine.

This was just adrenaline. Just the stress of the day. Just—

Just Eben's hand steadying him when he stumbled over a cable.

Just Eben's voice, quiet and certain, saying "I've got it" when Noel was drowning.

Just Eben, looking at him like he saw past the smile to the exhaustion underneath.

This was fine.

Noel was fine.

He just needed to survive eleven more days.

**EBEN**

By seven PM, the square was ready.

Eben stood at the edge and conducted a final assessment. Booths: secure. Lights: functional. Sound system: operational. Volunteers: briefed. Emergency protocols: established.

It was done.

They'd done it.

"It looks good," Noel said, appearing beside him.

"It looks functional."

"Same thing."

"Not quite."

"Close enough." Noel was quiet for a moment. Then: "Thank you. For today. I couldn't have done this without you."

"You could have."

"I would have. That's different."

Eben looked at him. "Is it?"

"Yeah." Noel's smile was soft. Tired. Real. "One is surviving. The other is—"

"Living?"

"Something like that."

They stood in silence, watching the lights twinkle across the square. Snow had started falling. Soft. Gentle. Perfect.

Eben hated how perfect it was.

Hated how right it felt to be standing here, next to Noel, watching something they'd built together.

Hated how much he wanted to stay.

"Tomorrow," Noel said quietly.

"Tomorrow," Eben agreed.

"Same time?"

"Same time."

Noel turned to face him. "This is temporary. Just for the festival."

"Temporary," Eben repeated.

The word sat between them like a lie they both needed to believe.

"Right," Noel said. "Temporary."

He didn't sound convinced.

Neither was Eben.

But they both nodded, and smiled, and pretended that twelve days was enough time to build something and not enough time to break when it ended.

And Eben, standing in the snow with Noel Merrick beside him, knew with absolute certainty that he was in trouble.
