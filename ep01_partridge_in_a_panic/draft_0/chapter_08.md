# Chapter 8: Hook Ending

The hall was quiet.

Eben stood in the center of Merryweather Hall and listened to the silence.

No vendors. No volunteers. No Hugh with his glitter emergencies or Mayor Kringle with his anxious hovering.

Just Noel, across the room, checking the volunteer schedule for tomorrow.

Just the two of them.

Just the question that hung in the air like snow waiting to fall: what now?

Eben should leave. The day was done. The festival was launched. His job for today was complete.

He didn't leave.

"I think that's everything," Noel said, looking up from his clipboard.

"The vendor permits are filed," Eben confirmed. "The volunteer schedule is set. The equipment is secured."

"So we're done."

"For today."

"Right. For today."

Silence.

Noel set down his clipboard. Crossed the room. Stopped a careful three feet away.

The distance felt deliberate.

"So," Noel said. "Tomorrow."

"Tomorrow," Eben agreed.

"Same time?"

"What time do you usually start?"

"Six AM."

"Then six AM."

Noel blinked. "You don't have to—"

"I'll be here."

"Eben—"

"Unless you don't want me here."

"That's not—" Noel ran a hand through his hair. "I just don't want you to feel obligated."

"I don't do things out of obligation."

"Then why?"

Because I want to, Eben thought. Because today was chaos and exhausting and the most alive I've felt in years. Because you make me want to stay, and that terrifies me, and I'm doing it anyway.

He didn't say any of that.

"Because the job isn't finished," he said instead.

"Right. The job."

"Eleven more days."

"Eleven more days," Noel repeated. His expression was complicated. "And then?"

"Then the festival ends. And I leave."

"Back to—where, exactly?"

"Wherever the next job is."

"You don't have a home base?"

"I have an apartment. That's not the same thing."

Noel looked at him like he was trying to solve a puzzle. "That sounds lonely."

"It's efficient."

"That's not the same thing either."

"Isn't it?"

"No." Noel's voice was soft. Certain. "It's really not."

Eben should argue. Should maintain the distance. Should remember that this was temporary and temporary meant safe and safe meant—

Alone.

Always alone.

"This is temporary," Eben said.

The words came out harder than he meant them to.

Noel flinched. Just slightly. But Eben saw it.

"Right," Noel said. "Temporary. Just for the festival."

"Just for the festival."

"Twelve days."

"Eleven now."

"Eleven." Noel's smile was brittle. "Then you leave, and I go back to doing this alone."

"You won't be alone. You'll have—"

"The volunteers. The town. I know." Noel's laugh was quiet. Bitter. "I'll be fine."

There it was again. That word.

Fine.

The lie Noel told himself. The lie Eben recognized because he'd told himself the same one for years.

"Noel—"

"It's okay." Noel stepped back. Creating more distance. "I get it. This is a job. You're here to do a job. And when it's done, you leave. That's how it works."

"Yes."

"So. Temporary."

"Temporary."

They looked at each other.

Eben wanted to close the distance. Wanted to say that temporary didn't have to mean nothing. That eleven days could matter. That—

He didn't.

Because eleven days did mean nothing. In the grand scheme of things. In the long run.

Eleven days was just enough time to want something and not enough time to keep it.

Eben knew that better than anyone.

"I should go," Eben said.

"Yeah. It's late."

"Tomorrow. Six AM."

"I'll be here."

"So will I."

Noel nodded. Smiled. It didn't reach his eyes.

Eben turned toward the door.

"Eben?"

He stopped. Looked back.

Noel was backlit by the hall's fluorescent lights. Exhausted. Beautiful. Real.

"Thank you," Noel said. "For today. I know I was—resistant. At first. But you—" He gestured vaguely. "You helped. A lot. So. Thank you."

"You're welcome."

"And I'm sorry. If I was difficult."

"You weren't difficult. You were drowning."

Noel's expression cracked. Just for a moment. Just enough for Eben to see the truth underneath.

"Yeah," Noel said quietly. "I was."

"You're not anymore."

"Because of you."

"Because of us."

The word hung between them.

Us.

Like they were a unit. A team. Like they were something more than a temporary arrangement.

"Us," Noel repeated. "For eleven more days."

"Eleven more days."

"Right."

Eben should leave. Should walk out the door. Should maintain the boundaries he'd spent years building.

"Noel," he said instead.

"Yeah?"

"This—" Eben gestured between them. "Whatever this is. It doesn't have to be—"

He stopped.

Because what was he going to say? It doesn't have to be temporary? It doesn't have to end?

That was a lie.

Everything ended.

Everything left.

That was the rule.

"Never mind," Eben said.

"Eben—"

"I'll see you tomorrow."

He left before Noel could respond.

The cold air hit him like a slap. Snow was still falling. The streets were empty. Quiet.

Eben walked to his car and sat in the driver's seat and stared at the dark windshield.

Temporary.

He'd said it like a promise. Like a boundary. Like a rule that would keep him safe.

It tasted like a lie.

Because the truth was, Eben had spent the entire day watching Noel Merrick smile and solve problems and refuse to admit he was drowning. Had spent the entire day wanting to fix things for him. Had spent the entire day feeling something he'd promised himself he wouldn't feel.

Attachment.

The thing that destroyed. The thing that left. The thing that hurt.

Eben had built his entire life around avoiding it.

And in one day, Noel Merrick had walked through every defense like they were made of paper.

"Temporary," Eben said to the empty car.

The word echoed.

He started the engine. Pulled out of the parking lot. Drove through the quiet streets of Tinsel Town with its twinkling lights and its Christmas magic and its festival that he'd helped save.

With Noel.

Eleven more days.

Eleven more days of working beside him. Of watching him smile. Of wanting to close the distance and knowing he couldn't.

Eleven more days of pretending this was just a job.

Eleven more days of lying to himself.

Eben drove home through the snow and tried to remember why he'd taken this job in the first place.

Clean execution. That was why. Get in, fix the problem, get out.

Before it became something he couldn't leave.

Too late, a voice whispered in his head.

Too late.

Outside, the snow was falling on Tinsel Town, covering everything in white. Making it clean. Making it new.

And Eben Frost sat in his apartment and stared at his gloves—armor, carefully maintained—and knew with absolute certainty that nothing about this was going to be temporary at all.

He just had to figure out what to do about it.

Eleven days.

It wasn't enough time.

It was too much time.

It was all the time he had.

And Eben, who had spent years perfecting the art of leaving, realized he had no idea how to stay.

But he was going to try.

Starting tomorrow.

At six AM.

When Noel would be there, smiling his exhausted smile, running on spite and coffee and sheer stubborn refusal to ask for help.

And Eben would be there too.

Because temporary or not, eleven days or not, job or not—

He wasn't ready to leave.

Not yet.

Maybe not ever.

And that was the most terrifying thing of all.
