# Chapter 5: First Crack

The inflatable snowman incident had been resolved with minimal property damage and maximum chaos.

Eben stood in the storage room behind Merryweather Hall and tried to process the last six hours.

He'd been hired for logistics.

He had not been hired for flaming snowmen, glitter emergencies, or managing a festival director who ran on caffeine and sheer stubborn refusal to admit defeat.

And yet.

Eben pulled off his gloves. One finger at a time. The familiar ritual helped him think.

The festival was chaos. Noel Merrick was chaos in human form.

Eben should hate this.

He did not hate this.

This was a problem.

Eben had built his entire adult life on a simple principle: clean execution. Get in, fix the problem, get out before it became something he couldn't leave.

Before it became something that could leave him.

Attachment was a promise to lose something. Eben had learned that lesson early and well. Better to stay on the edges. Better to be useful without being necessary.

Better to keep his gloves on.

He looked at his bare hands. Flexed his fingers.

The door opened.

Eben looked up.

Noel stood in the doorway, backlit by the hall's fluorescent lights. He looked—

Terrible. Wonderful. Exhausted.

Real.

His performer's smile was gone. What was left was something rawer. More honest.

Eben preferred it.

"Sorry," Noel said. "I didn't know anyone was in here. I just needed—"

He gestured vaguely at the shelves.

"Extension cords," Eben supplied.

"How did you—"

"You're replacing the ones that melted in the snowman incident."

Noel's laugh was startled. Genuine. "The snowman incident. That's what we're calling it?"

"Would you prefer 'The Great Inflatable Disaster of December Fourteenth'?"

"That's better. More dramatic." Noel stepped into the room. His eyes caught on Eben's hands. Lingered.

Eben should put his gloves back on.

He didn't.

"Long day," Eben said.

"Twelve more to go," Noel replied.

"Twelve isn't so many."

Noel looked at him. Really looked. Like he was trying to figure out a puzzle.

"You really believe that," Noel said.

"I do."

"Why?"

Because I'm counting them, Eben thought. Because every day with you is one day closer to the end, and I'm already dreading it.

He didn't say that.

"Fewer with two people," he said instead.

Noel's expression shifted. Softened.

"Fewer with two," he agreed quietly.

The silence stretched. Not uncomfortable. Just—present.

Eben was aware of the space between them. Three feet. Maybe less. Close enough to see the coffee stain on Noel's collar. Close enough to count the shadows under his eyes.

Close enough to want to close the distance.

Eben didn't move.

"You're good at this," Noel said suddenly.

"At what?"

"Fixing things. Organizing chaos. Being—" Noel gestured. "—competent."

"It's my job."

"It's more than that." Noel leaned against the doorframe. "You actually care. About getting it right."

"Don't you?"

"I care about people being happy. That's different."

"Is it?"

"You tell me."

Eben considered. "I think they're connected. People are happy when things work. Things work when someone cares about the details."

"That's very logical."

"I'm a very logical person."

"I noticed." Noel's smile was small. Tired. Real. "It's annoying."

"I've been told."

"By who?"

"Everyone I've ever worked with."

Noel laughed again. The sound did something dangerous to Eben's carefully controlled composure.

"I should get those extension cords," Noel said.

He didn't move.

Neither did Eben.

"Noel," Eben said.

It was the first time he'd used Noel's first name. Not Merrick. Not "the event coordinator."

Just Noel.

Noel's eyes widened slightly. "Yeah?"

"When did you last sleep?"

"I don't remember. That's probably bad, right?"

"That's very bad."

"I'll sleep in January."

"That's not sustainable."

"It's sustained me this far."

"That's not the same thing."

Noel pushed off the doorframe. Crossed to the shelves. Found the extension cords.

When he turned back, he was closer. Close enough that Eben could see the exact shade of brown in his eyes. Warm. Like coffee. Like cinnamon.

"You don't have to worry about me," Noel said.

"I'm not worried. I'm concerned. Professionally."

"Professionally."

"Yes."

"Right." Noel's smile turned wry. "Because we're professionals."

"We are."

"Working together."

"Temporarily."

The word landed between them like a stone.

Noel's expression flickered. "Temporarily," he repeated.

"Twelve days."

"Then you leave."

"Then I leave."

"And I go back to doing this alone."

Eben's chest tightened. "You won't be alone. You'll have the volunteers. The town. You'll—"

"I'll be fine," Noel finished. "I know. I'm always fine."

He said it like a mantra. Like something he'd repeated so many times it had worn grooves in his mind.

Eben recognized it. The lie people told themselves to keep moving.

He'd told himself the same lie for years.

"Noel—"

"I should get back." Noel moved toward the door. "Thanks. For today. For helping."

"You don't have to thank me."

"I know. But I'm going to anyway." Noel paused in the doorway. Looked back. "You're not what I expected."

"What did you expect?"

"Someone more..." Noel gestured vaguely. "Cold. Distant. You know. Frost."

"I am cold and distant."

"You're really not."

"I'm very controlled."

"That's different." Noel's smile was soft. Dangerous. "Control isn't the same as cold."

He left before Eben could respond.

Eben stood alone in the storage room, extension cords forgotten, and tried to remember why he'd taken this job.

Clean execution. That was why. Get in, fix the festival, get out.

Don't get attached.

Don't let it become something you can't leave.

Don't—

Eben looked at his bare hands.

Slowly, deliberately, he pulled his gloves back on.

One finger at a time.

Armor back in place.

It didn't help.

He could still feel the warmth of Noel's smile. Could still hear the way he'd said "fewer with two" like it meant something.

Could still see the exhaustion in his eyes and the stubborn set of his jaw and the way he'd looked at Eben's hands like—

Like—

Eben closed his eyes.

Twelve days.

He could do twelve days.

He'd done harder things.

He just had to remember: this was temporary. Everything was temporary. That was the rule. That was how he stayed safe.

That was how he kept from losing anything else.

"Temporary," Eben said to the empty room.

It tasted like a lie.

He left the storage room and returned to the chaos, where Noel was already solving three problems at once with a smile that didn't reach his eyes.

And Eben, despite every rule he'd ever made for himself, wanted to fix that too.
