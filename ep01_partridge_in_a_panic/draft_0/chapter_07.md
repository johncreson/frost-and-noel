# Chapter 7: Evening Save

The lights came on at exactly eight PM.

Noel stood at the edge of Evergreen Square and watched the transformation.

One moment: construction zone. Chaos. Potential disaster.

The next: magic.

Thousands of tiny white lights blazed to life across the square. The tree glowed like a beacon. The booths sparkled. Even the sad inflatable snowman—replaced after the incident—looked dignified in the golden light.

The crowd that had gathered gasped.

Then applauded.

Noel's chest did something complicated.

They'd done it.

Day one.

One down. Eleven to go.

"It's beautiful," someone said.

Noel turned. An older woman stood beside him, eyes bright with tears.

"Thank you," Noel said automatically.

"No, thank *you*. This town needed this. We all needed this."

She squeezed his arm and moved into the crowd.

Noel stood very still and tried not to feel the weight of that.

Needed.

He was needed.

That should feel good. That should feel like enough.

It felt like drowning.

"Noel."

Eben's voice. Quiet. Close.

Noel turned. Eben stood three feet away, hands in his pockets, expression unreadable.

"We have a problem," Eben said.

Of course they did.

"What kind of problem?" Noel asked.

"The sound system. It's cutting out."

"I thought you checked it."

"I did. It was fine twenty minutes ago."

"And now?"

"Now it's not."

Noel looked at the crowd. At the mayor, who was preparing to give his opening speech. At the photographer, ready to capture the moment.

At the festival that was supposed to be perfect.

"How bad?" Noel asked.

"Fixable. But we need to do it now."

"Can you—"

"I need your help."

Noel blinked. Eben Frost, who had spent the entire day fixing things independently, needed his help.

"Okay," Noel said. "Show me."

They moved through the crowd together. Eben led him to the sound booth, tucked behind the main stage.

"There," Eben said, pointing to a tangle of cables. "Something's loose. But I can't reach it and hold the board steady at the same time."

"So you need—"

"Someone to hold the board while I fix the connection."

"You need me to hold something."

"Yes."

"That's it?"

"That's it."

Noel stared at him. "You could have asked any volunteer."

"I asked you."

"Why?"

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "Because I trust you."

The words hit like a physical thing.

Trust.

Eben Frost, who had known him for less than twelve hours, trusted him.

"Okay," Noel said quietly. "Tell me what to do."

Eben directed him. Noel held the board steady. Eben's hands moved with precise efficiency, tightening connections, testing cables.

They were close. Close enough that Noel could feel the warmth of Eben's shoulder against his. Close enough to smell whatever clean, winter scent Eben used.

Close enough to be dangerous.

"Got it," Eben said.

He didn't move away.

Neither did Noel.

"Test it," Eben said.

Noel flipped the switch. Clean sound poured through the speakers.

"Perfect," Noel said.

"Perfect," Eben agreed.

They were still close. Still not moving.

Noel could feel his pulse in his throat. Could feel the cold air and the warm lights and Eben, solid and certain beside him.

"We should—" Noel started.

"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!" Mayor Kringle's voice boomed through the speakers. "WELCOME TO THE FIRST ANNUAL TWELVE DAYS OF TINSEL TOWN FESTIVAL!"

The crowd cheered.

The moment broke.

Eben stepped back. Put his gloves on. One finger at a time.

Armor back in place.

"We should watch," Eben said.

"Yeah," Noel agreed.

They moved to the edge of the crowd. Side by side. Not touching.

Mayor Kringle gave his speech. Something about community and tradition and the magic of Christmas. Noel had heard it before. Had probably written half of it.

But standing here, watching the lights reflect on the snow, feeling the warmth of the crowd and the cold of the air and Eben's presence beside him—

It felt different.

It felt real.

"You did this," Eben said quietly.

"We did this," Noel corrected.

"You had the vision. I just helped execute it."

"You did more than that."

"Did I?"

Noel looked at him. Eben was watching the crowd, expression neutral. But there was something in his eyes. Something soft.

"Yeah," Noel said. "You did."

The mayor finished his speech. The crowd applauded. Music started playing—something festive and warm.

A few couples started dancing.

Noel watched them and felt something ache in his chest.

"Long day," Eben said.

"Twelve more to go."

"Eleven."

"What?"

"Eleven more. We finished day one."

"Right." Noel laughed quietly. "Eleven more."

"That's not so many."

"You keep saying that."

"Because it's true."

"Or because you're trying to convince yourself."

Eben looked at him. Really looked.

"Maybe both," he said.

The honesty of it hit Noel sideways.

"Eben—"

"We should go," Eben said. "Final check of the hall. Make sure everything's locked down for tomorrow."

He was retreating. Noel could see it. The walls going back up. The distance being reestablished.

He should let him.

He should maintain his own distance.

He should not be noticing the way the lights caught in Eben's dark hair, or the way his voice went softer when he was tired, or the way he'd said "I trust you" like it cost him something.

"Yeah," Noel said. "Let's go."

They walked back to Merryweather Hall in silence. The crowd's noise faded behind them. The streets were quiet. Snow fell soft and steady.

It was peaceful.

It was terrifying.

Because Noel realized, somewhere between the hall and the square, between the chaos and the lights, between the morning's friction and the evening's trust—

He didn't want this to be temporary.

And that was a problem.

Because Eben Frost was here for twelve days. Eleven now.

And then he'd leave.

And Noel would go back to doing this alone.

Like always.

Useful. Needed. Alone.

He looked at Eben, walking beside him in the snow, and tried to remember why that had ever been enough.

He couldn't.

And that was the most terrifying thing of all.
