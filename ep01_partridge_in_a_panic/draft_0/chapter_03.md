# Chapter 3: Competence Clash

Noel was going to kill Mayor Kringle.

Not immediately. He had a festival to run. But eventually. With something festive. Maybe a candy cane. Those were surprisingly sharp if you broke them right.

He watched Eben Frost cross the hall toward the vendor area, moving with the kind of deliberate precision that suggested he'd never stumbled in his life.

The man had the energy of someone who alphabetized his underwear and judged people silently for not doing the same.

Noel hated him.

Except.

Except he'd known about the permits. And the sound system. And he'd apparently read the entire briefing file, which Noel himself had written at two AM in a fugue state of exhaustion and spite.

Competent, Noel thought grimly. The man was competent.

This was inconvenient.

"Noel!" Wes appeared at his elbow with a coffee cup the size of a small bucket. "Brought reinforcements."

"You're a saint," Noel said, accepting it gratefully.

"I'm really not." Wes nodded toward Eben. "So. That's the help."

"Apparently."

"He looks..."

"Like he's conducting an autopsy on my life choices?"

"I was going to say 'intense,' but sure."

Noel took a long drink of coffee. It was perfect. Wes always knew his order. Three shots, oat milk, enough sugar to constitute a health hazard.

"Mayor Kringle hired him without telling me," Noel said.

"Classic Kringle." Wes leaned against the wall, watching the hall with the air of someone settling in for a show. "How long do you give it before you two either kiss or commit murder?"

Noel choked on his coffee. "What?"

"I'm just saying. There's a vibe."

"The vibe is mutual irritation."

"Uh-huh." Wes's smile was infuriating. "He's been staring at you for ten minutes."

"He's been here for ten minutes total."

"My point exactly."

Noel refused to look. He absolutely refused to—

He looked.

Eben was across the hall, talking to a vendor. Not looking at Noel at all.

"You're delusional," Noel told Wes.

"And you're deflecting." Wes pushed off the wall. "I'll be at the bakery if you need me. Try not to set anything on fire."

"That was one time!"

"It was three times."

"The third one doesn't count. That was Hugh's fault."

"Everything is Hugh's fault," Wes agreed, and left.

Noel stood alone with his coffee and his dignity, both of which were running low.

He should get back to work. There were approximately ninety problems that needed solving, and standing around thinking about Eben Frost's staring habits—which Wes had definitely imagined—wasn't solving any of them.

He turned toward the storage room.

And nearly collided with Eben.

"Jesus!" Noel stumbled back, coffee sloshing. "Do you have to sneak up on people?"

"I walked normally," Eben said. "You weren't paying attention."

"I was paying attention to the ninety-three things currently on fire."

"Nothing is literally on fire."

"Give it time."

Eben's expression didn't change, but something in his eyes might have been amusement. It was hard to tell. The man's face was a fortress.

"The vendor placement issue is resolved," Eben said.

Noel blinked. "What?"

"The two vendors arguing about booth location. I moved them."

"You can't just—"

"I already did. They're both satisfied with the new arrangement. Traffic flow is improved. No one is blocking the emergency exits anymore."

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it.

He'd been planning to handle that. After the permits. And the ribbons. And the seventeen other things on his list.

"You're welcome," Eben said.

"I didn't thank you."

"I noticed."

They stared at each other.

This was ridiculous. Eben had solved a problem. That was good. That was helpful. Noel should be grateful.

He was not grateful.

He was annoyed that he hadn't solved it himself.

"The volunteer sign-in sheets," Noel said. "You said they were in storage?"

"Second shelf. Left side."

"How did you—"

"Logical placement based on accessibility and frequency of use."

Of course.

Noel brushed past him toward the storage room, very carefully not noticing the way Eben stepped aside at exactly the right moment, or the way the air felt different in the space where they'd almost touched.

Professional awareness. That was all. He was aware of where his colleague was. Completely normal.

He found the sign-in sheets exactly where Eben said they'd be.

He hated that.

When he emerged, Eben was reorganizing the volunteer check-in table. Without being asked. Just—doing it.

"Do you ever stop?" Noel asked.

Eben looked up. "Stop what?"

"Fixing things."

"Do you?"

Fair point.

Noel set down the sheets. Eben had already created a system: sign-in, badge distribution, assignment cards. It was efficient. Logical.

Annoying.

"This is good," Noel admitted grudgingly.

"Thank you."

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Wouldn't dream of it."

Was that sarcasm? It was hard to tell. Eben's voice was so carefully controlled that emotion had to fight its way through layers of frost to reach the surface.

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice carried across the hall. "We have a glitter emergency!"

"Is anyone bleeding?" Noel called back.

"Not yet!"

"Then it's not an emergency!"

"It's EMOTIONALLY an emergency!"

Noel closed his eyes briefly. Opened them. "I should—"

"Handle the glitter crisis," Eben finished. "I'll manage the volunteer check-in."

"You don't have to—"

"I'm already here. You're needed elsewhere. This is basic resource allocation."

Noel wanted to argue. He really did.

But Hugh was waving frantically, and there was glitter literally everywhere, and Eben was right.

He hated that Eben was right.

"Fine," Noel said. "But don't reorganize anything else without asking."

"I'll try to restrain myself."

Definitely sarcasm that time.

Noel crossed the hall to deal with Hugh's glitter crisis, which turned out to be both more and less serious than advertised. Yes, there was glitter everywhere. No, it wasn't fixable. Glitter was eternal. Glitter was inevitable.

"It's fine," Noel told Hugh. "We'll just... embrace the sparkle."

"You're a visionary," Hugh declared.

"I'm tired."

"Same thing, really."

By the time Noel returned to the check-in table, Eben had processed six volunteers, assigned them all to appropriate stations, and somehow acquired a second clipboard.

"You have a clipboard," Noel observed.

"I brought it with me."

"Of course you did."

"Organization is important."

"So is spontaneity."

"Spontaneity is just poor planning with better marketing."

Noel stared at him. "Did you just—was that a joke?"

"No."

"It sounded like a joke."

"I don't joke."

"Everyone jokes."

"I don't."

Noel studied him. Eben's expression was perfectly neutral. But there was something in his eyes. A flicker. A spark.

"You're messing with me," Noel said.

"I wouldn't dare."

Definitely messing with him.

Noel felt something dangerous happen in his chest. Something warm and inconvenient.

He shoved it down.

"I'm going to check on the sound system," he said.

"I already checked it. It's fine."

"I'm going to check it anyway."

"Suit yourself."

Noel fled.

Not fled. Walked purposefully. Toward the sound system. Which was fine, exactly as Eben had said.

He stood there for a moment, staring at the perfectly functional equipment, and tried to figure out what was happening.

Eben Frost was competent. Efficient. Possibly the most organized human being Noel had ever encountered.

He was also annoying. Presumptuous. And he kept fixing things before Noel could fix them himself.

And Noel was—

Not grateful.

Not interested.

Not noticing the way Eben moved through space like he'd measured it first, or the way his voice did something complicated to Noel's pulse, or the way he'd looked when he'd taken off his gloves—

Noel was fine.

Completely fine.

He just needed more coffee.

And possibly a new personality.

"Noel?" A volunteer appeared. "There's a problem with the—"

"On it," Noel said, and dove gratefully back into the chaos.

Where he belonged.

Where he was useful.

Where he definitely wasn't thinking about Eben Frost's hands.
