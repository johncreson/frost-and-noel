# Chapter 2: First Meeting

Eben Frost did not believe in chaos.

Chaos was just order that hadn't been properly categorized yet.

The Merryweather Hall, however, was testing that theory.

He stood in the doorway and conducted a rapid assessment: Fourteen vendors in various states of setup. Structural sound, but the booth placement violated basic traffic flow principles. Volunteer coordination appeared nonexistent. Someone had brought a dog. There was a man wearing what appeared to be a cape made of tinsel.

And in the center of it all—

Eben's gaze snagged on him immediately.

The event coordinator. Had to be. He was the eye of the storm, the point everyone orbited around. Mid-twenties, maybe. Rumpled shirt. Exhausted eyes. And a smile that looked like it had been applied with a trowel and sheer force of will.

He smiled like someone who had learned to do it from a book and then practiced until it stopped looking terrifying.

It almost worked.

Eben watched him handle three separate crises in ninety seconds: redirecting a vendor, soothing an argument, and somehow producing a roll of tape from thin air. Efficient. Competent.

Running on fumes.

Eben knew the signs. The micro-tremor in the hands. The too-bright eyes. The smile that never quite reached the rest of his face.

This was a man holding everything together through sheer stubborn refusal to let go.

Eben understood that. Respected it, even.

It was also completely unsustainable.

"Mr. Frost!" Mayor Kringle appeared at his elbow like a anxious Christmas ghost. "You made it! Wonderful! Let me introduce you to—"

"The event coordinator," Eben said, still watching the man in the center of the chaos. "Noel Merrick."

"Yes! How did you—"

"Process of elimination." Eben turned to face the mayor. "You said the festival was understaffed and over-ambitious. He's the only one managing the entire floor."

Mayor Kringle beamed like Eben had just solved world hunger. "Exactly! Which is why we need you. Noel's wonderful, absolutely wonderful, but he's been doing this alone and—well. You'll see."

Eben had already seen.

The question was whether Noel Merrick would accept help, or whether this was going to be twelve days of managing someone else's pride while also managing a festival.

Eben had been hired for logistics. He had a feeling he'd just been drafted for diplomacy.

He hated diplomacy.

"Does he know I'm coming?" Eben asked.

Mayor Kringle's smile flickered. "I... mentioned it."

"When?"

"Just now. Via text."

Eben closed his eyes briefly. Opened them. "So he doesn't know."

"He knows there's help! He just doesn't know it's... you. Specifically. Yet."

Perfect.

Eben had been hired to fix a festival. Apparently, he'd also been hired to ambush someone who clearly didn't want to be fixed.

"I'll introduce you!" Mayor Kringle said brightly, and before Eben could suggest literally any other approach, the mayor was already crossing the floor.

Eben followed, because the alternative was standing in the doorway like a particularly judgmental statue.

Up close, Noel Merrick looked worse.

Not bad. Just—worn. Like a coat that had been through one too many winters. His eyes were bloodshot. There was a coffee stain on his collar. And his smile, which had seemed merely professional from a distance, was absolutely screaming for mercy up close.

"Noel!" Mayor Kringle said. "This is Eben Frost. He's the help I mentioned!"

Noel's smile didn't waver. But something behind his eyes went very, very still.

"Help," he repeated.

"Logistics consultant," Eben clarified. "The mayor hired me to assist with festival operations."

"I'm handling the operations," Noel said.

His voice was pleasant. Warm, even. But there was steel underneath.

Eben respected that too.

"I'm sure you are," Eben said. "The mayor felt a second set of hands might be useful."

"I have hands." Noel held them up, as if providing evidence. "Two of them. Fully functional."

"They're shaking," Eben observed.

Noel's hands immediately dropped. The smile stayed fixed.

"Caffeine," he said.

"Exhaustion," Eben corrected.

The mayor made a small, nervous sound. "Well! I'll just let you two get acquainted! Eben, Noel will show you around. Noel, Eben is here for the full twelve days, so—"

"Twelve days," Noel said flatly.

"Merry Christmas!" Mayor Kringle fled.

Eben didn't blame him.

Silence stretched between them. Around them, the chaos of the hall continued—vendors shouting, someone hammering something, the dog barking—but in their small bubble of space, it was very, very quiet.

Noel's smile finally cracked.

Not broke. Just—shifted. Into something sharper.

"I didn't ask for help," he said.

"I'm aware."

"I don't need help."

"Also aware."

"Then why are you here?"

Eben considered his options. He could be diplomatic. Reassuring. He could ease into this with tact and sensitivity.

He looked at Noel Merrick's exhausted, furious eyes and decided on honesty.

"Because the mayor is panicking," Eben said. "Because the festival is understaffed. And because you've been awake for at least thirty-six hours and you're running on spite and coffee."

Noel blinked. "Thirty-seven."

"Excuse me?"

"Thirty-seven hours. If you're going to assess me, at least be accurate."

Something almost like amusement flickered in Eben's chest. He ignored it.

"Thirty-seven," he agreed. "My mistake."

Noel stared at him. Eben stared back.

This was, Eben reflected, possibly the worst introduction he'd ever had. And he'd once been hired to reorganize a library where the head librarian communicated exclusively through hostile sticky notes.

"Look," Noel said finally. "I appreciate the mayor's... concern. But I have this under control."

"Do you."

"Yes."

"The vendor permits weren't filed."

Noel's expression went very carefully blank. "How did you—"

"The mayor mentioned it. I called the permit office on my way here. They open at eight. I have the emergency filing number."

Noel's jaw tightened. "I was going to handle that."

"I'm sure you were. Now you don't have to."

"I don't need you to—"

"The sound system has a loose connection in the main board," Eben continued. "The volunteer sign-in sheets are in the storage room, second shelf. And someone ordered chartreuse ribbon instead of forest green."

Noel just stared at him.

"I read the briefing file," Eben said. "And I've been here for five minutes. Do you want to keep arguing about whether you need help, or do you want to save this festival?"

It was harsh. Eben knew it was harsh.

But Noel Merrick was drowning, and drowning people didn't respond well to gentle suggestions. They responded to life preservers.

Even if they resented the person throwing them.

Noel's smile had vanished completely now. What was left was something rawer. More real.

Eben preferred it.

"Fine," Noel said. "You want to help? Start with the booth placement. It's a disaster."

"I noticed."

"Of course you did."

Eben pulled off his gloves. One finger at a time. Deliberate. Controlled.

He didn't miss the way Noel's eyes tracked the movement.

"Where do you want me?" Eben asked.

Noel's expression did something complicated.

"Anywhere that's not directly in my way," he said finally.

Eben almost smiled.

Almost.

"I'll do my best," he said.

And he meant it as a promise.

Or possibly a threat.

With Noel Merrick, he suspected it might be both.
