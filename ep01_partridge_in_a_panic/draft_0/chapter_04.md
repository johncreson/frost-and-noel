# Chapter 4: Town Watches

By noon, they'd moved operations to Evergreen Square.

Noel stood at the edge of the plaza and tried to remember why he'd thought this was a good idea.

The festival. The twelve days. The entire elaborate production that was supposed to put Tinsel Town on the map and boost winter tourism and make everyone's Christmas magical.

Right now, it looked like a construction zone had a baby with a craft store explosion.

Booths in various states of assembly. Lights tangled in heaps. Someone's inflatable snowman listing sadly to one side. And in the center of it all, a massive Christmas tree that was supposed to be the festival's crown jewel but currently looked like it had lost a fight with gravity.

"It'll come together," Noel told himself.

"Will it?"

Noel jumped. Eben had appeared beside him like a particularly judgmental ghost.

"Do you have to do that?" Noel demanded.

"Do what?"

"Materialize. Silently. Like you're auditioning for a horror movie."

"I walked normally. Again."

"You walk like a cat. It's unnerving."

Something flickered in Eben's expression. "I've been called worse."

Noel wanted to ask what, exactly, but Wes chose that moment to arrive with a tray of pastries and an expression that meant trouble.

"Gentlemen," Wes said, in the tone of someone about to cause problems on purpose. "I brought sustenance."

"You're a saint," Noel said, reaching for a croissant.

"So I've been told." Wes turned to Eben. "We haven't been properly introduced. Wes Candle. I run the bakery on Main Street."

"Eben Frost." Eben shook his hand with the kind of precision that suggested he'd calculated the exact amount of pressure required.

"The logistics consultant," Wes said.

"Yes."

"Interesting."

"Is it?"

"Very." Wes's smile was dangerous. "Noel doesn't usually accept help."

"I noticed."

"And yet here you are."

"Here I am."

They looked at each other. Noel had the distinct impression he was watching some kind of silent negotiation happening in a language he didn't speak.

"Well," Wes said finally. "Good luck."

"With the festival?" Eben asked.

"Sure. Let's go with that." Wes turned to Noel. "I'll be at the coffee station if you need me. Try not to set anything on fire."

"It was three times and you need to let it go," Noel called after him.

Wes just waved.

Eben was looking at him.

"I don't want to know," Eben said.

"Probably for the best."

They stood in silence for a moment, watching the chaos of the square. Volunteers swarmed like particularly festive ants. Someone was arguing about light placement. The inflatable snowman had given up entirely and was now just a sad puddle of vinyl.

"This is going to be a disaster," Noel said.

"Yes," Eben agreed.

Noel looked at him. "You're supposed to say something reassuring."

"I don't do reassuring. I do realistic."

"Realistic is depressing."

"Realistic is honest."

"I hate that you're right."

"You'll get used to it."

Noel absolutely would not get used to it.

"NOEL!" Mayor Kringle appeared like a anxious whirlwind. "How's it going? Is everything on schedule? It looks wonderful! Is it wonderful? It's going to be wonderful, right?"

"It's going to be fine," Noel said, smile clicking into place.

"Fine! Yes! Fine is good! Fine is—" The mayor looked at Eben. "You're helping, right? You're helping him?"

"I'm attempting to," Eben said.

"Wonderful! You two make a great team! Very efficient! Very—" The mayor gestured vaguely. "—intense. In a good way! A productive way!"

Noel's smile felt like it might crack his face. "We're managing."

"Managing! Perfect! I'll just—I have a thing—" Mayor Kringle fled toward a group of volunteers.

Silence.

"He's terrified," Eben observed.

"He's always terrified. It's his natural state."

"And yet he's the mayor."

"Democracy is a beautiful disaster."

Eben's mouth twitched. It might have been a smile. It was hard to tell.

"Noel!" Hugh appeared in a cloud of silver and determination. "I need your opinion on the ribbon situation!"

"I thought we resolved the ribbon situation."

"We resolved the color crisis. Now we have a texture emergency."

"How is texture an emergency?"

"Satin versus grosgrain. It's a matter of structural integrity."

Noel looked at Eben. Eben looked back.

"I'll handle the tree lighting," Eben said.

"You don't have to—"

"Ribbon emergencies are outside my expertise."

"Everything is outside Hugh's definition of emergency."

"Then you're the right person for the job."

Hugh grabbed Noel's arm. "Come! We must consult!"

Noel let himself be dragged away, but not before catching Eben's expression.

Was that amusement?

It was definitely something.

The ribbon consultation took twenty minutes and involved more opinions about textile physics than Noel thought possible. By the time he escaped, the square had transformed.

Booths were upright. Lights were strung. The tree looked less like it was plotting revenge and more like an actual Christmas tree.

And Eben was in the center of it all, directing volunteers with quiet efficiency.

Noel watched him work.

He moved like he'd choreographed it. Every gesture deliberate. Every instruction clear. And people listened. Not because he was loud or commanding, but because he was certain.

Competent, Noel thought again.

Annoyingly competent.

"He's good," Wes said, appearing at Noel's elbow.

"He's adequate."

"He's been staring at you for the last ten minutes."

"He has not."

"He looked over here six times. I counted."

"You have too much free time."

"I have the perfect amount of free time." Wes handed him a coffee. "You like him."

"I tolerate him."

"Same thing."

"It's really not."

"Noel." Wes's voice went serious. "When's the last time you let someone help you?"

Noel's chest did something complicated. "I let people help all the time."

"You let people need you. That's different."

"It's the same thing."

"It's really not."

Noel took a long drink of coffee. It was perfect. It was always perfect. Wes knew his order. Wes knew him.

"I'm fine," Noel said.

"You're exhausted."

"I'm functional."

"You're running on fumes and spite."

"It's gotten me this far."

Wes sighed. "Just—try not to push him away, okay? He's trying."

"I'm not pushing anyone away."

"You're doing that thing where you smile and deflect."

"This is just my face."

"This is your 'I'm fine' face. It's different from your actual face."

"I don't have multiple faces."

"Everyone has multiple faces. Yours just happen to all be variations of 'I'm handling it.'"

Noel wanted to argue. He really did.

But across the square, Eben looked up. Their eyes met.

And Noel forgot what he was going to say.

Eben held his gaze for a beat too long. Then nodded. Once. Deliberate.

Noel nodded back.

"See?" Wes said. "Staring."

"That was eye contact. Professional eye contact."

"Uh-huh."

"It was!"

"Whatever you say." Wes patted his shoulder. "I'll be at the bakery. Try not to—"

"Set anything on fire, I know."

"I was going to say 'overthink it,' but sure."

Wes left.

Noel stood alone with his coffee and his thoughts, both of which were becoming problematic.

He wasn't overthinking anything.

He was just—aware. Professionally aware. Of his colleague. Who was competent and efficient and possibly the most organized human being on the planet.

That was all.

Completely normal.

"Noel!" A volunteer waved. "We have a problem with the—"

There was a small popping sound.

Then a larger popping sound.

Then the distinct smell of burning plastic.

Noel turned slowly.

The inflatable snowman was on fire.

"NOBODY PANIC!" Hugh shouted, which immediately made everyone panic.

Noel ran.
