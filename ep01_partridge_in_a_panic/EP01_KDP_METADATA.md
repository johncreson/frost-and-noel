## BLURBS

### Blurb A: Hook-Forward (Recommended)

Noel Merrick has been awake for thirty-seven hours and is handling it *fine*.

Running Tinsel Town's legendary Twelve Days of Magic festival should be a dream job. Instead, it's a chaos parade of glitter explosions, rogue partridges, and a mayor who communicates exclusively in holiday metaphors. Noel doesn't need help. He needs caffeine, a miracle, and maybe a good scream into the void.

What he gets is Eben Frost.

Cold. Competent. Clipboard-clutching. The logistics consultant the mayor hired without asking. Eben is everything Noel isn't—controlled, organized, and infuriatingly calm in a crisis. He's also the most attractive problem Noel has ever encountered.

Eben doesn't do attachments. He does clean entries, efficient solutions, and cleaner exits. Twelve days. That's all this is. Just long enough to fix the festival. Not nearly long enough to fix the way Noel Merrick looks at him like he's something worth staying for.

But when a shared glitter emergency turns into an accidental partnership—and accidental touches start feeling way too intentional—"temporary" starts sounding like the biggest lie either of them has ever told.

**Day one of twelve. Let the chaos begin.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring grumpy-sunshine dynamics, forced proximity, holiday disasters, explicit heat, and a guaranteed HEA.*

### Blurb B: Emotion-Forward

He doesn't need a fixer.  
He needs to be enough on his own.

Noel Merrick has spent years proving he can hold Tinsel Town together during the holidays. The festival? His responsibility. The crises? His to solve. The smile that hides how close he is to breaking? Nobody's business.

Then the mayor assigns him "help."

Eben Frost arrives with a clipboard, a charcoal coat, and zero patience for holiday chaos. He's there to fix the festival—not the exhausted event director who won't ask for anything he actually needs.

But Eben has a problem. Noel Merrick isn't just competent. He's kind. Warm. The human equivalent of a cup of cocoa Eben didn't order but somehow can't stop drinking.

This is temporary. Twelve days. Then Eben goes back to his life of clean exits and empty apartments.

Unless the man with the tired smile and chapped hands makes him want to stay.

*The first episode of Frost & Noel: a cozy MM holiday romance series with grumpy-sunshine chemistry, forced proximity, and all the Christmas chaos.*
