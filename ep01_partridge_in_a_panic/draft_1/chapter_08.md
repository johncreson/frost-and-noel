# Chapter 8: Hook Ending

The hall was finally quiet.

Eben stood in the center of Merryweather Hall and listened to the silence. It was a cold, hollow sound, missing the frantic energy of the day, missing the shouting vendors and Hugh’s glitter-cannon booms and Mayor Kringle’s anxious questions.

It was just the two of them.

Across the room, Noel was huddled over the volunteer schedule for tomorrow, the harsh fluorescent lights washing out the warmth in his face. He looked like a man who was only held together by the ink on his clipboard.

Eben should leave. His contract for Day One was complete. The systems were stable. The equipment was secured. He had no logistical reason to remain in this building.

He didn't move.

"I think that’s everything." Noel looked up, his voice faint, stripped of its performer's charm. 

"The permits are finalized." Eben’s voice sounded too loud in the empty hall. "The volunteer schedule is optimized for the morning rush. The emergency protocols are in place."

"So we're done."

"For today."

"Right. For today."

Silence returned, heavier than before. Noel set down his clipboard with a clatter that echoed through the rafters. He crossed the floor, stopping at the three-foot boundary—the clinical line Eben had drawn this morning.

The distance felt like a failure of geometry.

"So. Tomorrow."

"Tomorrow."

"Same time? Six AM?"

"I’ll be here."

Noel blinked, a flicker of surprise breaking through the exhaustion. "You don't have to be. I can handle the morning setup. I’ve done it for years."

"I don't do things out of obligation, Noel. I do them because they are necessary for the integrity of the project."

"And I'm part of the project?"

"You are the center of it."

Noel looked at him then, his gaze heavy and searching. "That sounds a lot like you care about the person, Frost. Not just the data."

Eben felt the familiar tightening in his chest—the warning system. *Attachment destroys what you build.*

"I care about the outcome."

"Right. The outcome." Noel laughed quietly, a bitter sound that didn't suit him. "Eleven more days of outcomes. Then you leave."

"That is the arrangement."

"Back to the 'clean exits.' Back to the apartment that isn't a home."

Eben tightened his grip on his own clipboard. "It’s efficient. It prevents unnecessary complications."

"Efficiency isn’t the same as living, Eben. I thought you were an analyst."

"I am."

"Then analyze why you’re still standing here instead of going to your hotel."

Eben didn't have an answer that fit into a spreadsheet. He was standing here because the thought of walking out those doors and leaving Noel alone in this hollow hall felt like a logistical catastrophe. He was standing here because the 'temporary' lie was beginning to taste like ash.

"This is temporary." Eben’s voice was hard.

Noel flinched, a small, barely visible motion that hit Eben harder than the snowman fire. "I know. Just for the festival."

"Twelve days."

"Ten now." Noel stepped back, the distance widening once more. "Then you leave, and I go back to being the one this town needs. Alone."

"You have the town, Noel. You have Wes. You have Hugh."

"I have a lot of people who need me, Eben. That’s not the same as having someone who stays."

The honesty of it was a breach of every boundary Eben had ever built. He wanted to close the distance. He wanted to say that ten days was a lifetime if you measured it in something other than minutes. He wanted to say *I'll stay*.

He didn't. 

Because everything ended. Every project closed. Every city faded into the rearview mirror. That was the only system that never failed.

"I should go."

"Yeah. Me too."

"Six AM. Don't be late."

"I’m never late, Frost. I’m just 'spiritually delayed.'"

Noel smiled then—the first version of his real smile that Eben had seen since the storage room. It was soft, tired, and absolutely devastating.

Eben turned and walked out of the hall without looking back.

The winter air hit him like a physical blow, carrying the scent of cold pine and distant woodsmoke. The streets of Tinsel Town were quiet, the festive lights reflecting on the fresh snow like scattered diamonds. It was beautiful. It was magic. It was a nightmare.

Eben sat in his car and stared at the dark windshield. He looked at his leather gloves—the armor he’d put back on the moment they’d left the sound booth. 

*I trust you*, he had said. 

It was a catastrophic failure of logic.

"Temporary." He whispered it to the dashboard. 

The word didn't mean anything anymore. 

Because as he started the engine and drove through the quiet, twinkling streets, Eben Frost knew the truth. Noel Merrick had walked through his defenses with a smile and a "glitter emergency" and a heart that was too large for his own good. And Eben, the man of clean exits and efficient systems, was already beginning to realize that the hardest part of the twelve days wasn't going to be the work.

It was going to be the leaving.

He drove home through the snow, the feeling of Noel's shoulder against his in the sound booth still a ghost-warmth in his mind. 

Ten more days. 

It was too much time. It wasn't nearly enough. 

And as the snow covered Tinsel Town in a blanket of white, Eben Frost finally admitted the data point he had been trying to ignore.

He wasn't here to save the festival. He was here to find a reason to stay. 

And that was the most terrifying thing of all.
