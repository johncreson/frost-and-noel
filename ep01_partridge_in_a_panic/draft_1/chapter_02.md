# Chapter 2: First Meeting

Eben Frost did not believe in chaos.

Chaos was just order that hadn't been properly categorized yet. It was a failure of systems, a breakdown of logic. And Eben was, if nothing else, a man of systems.

The Merryweather Hall, however, was testing that theory with a dedicated, almost malicious enthusiasm.

Eben stood in the doorway, his leather gloves still on, and conducted a rapid, clinical assessment. Fourteen vendors in various states of logistical meltdown. Structural sound, but the booth placement violated basic traffic flow principles—a bottleneck waiting to happen. Volunteer coordination appeared to be a rumor rather than a reality. Someone had brought a terrier that was currently eyeing a buffet table. And there was a man wearing a cape made of silver tinsel who was, unfortunately, the loudest thing in the room.

And in the center of it all—

Eben's gaze snagged on him immediately.

The event coordinator. Noel Merrick. Eben had seen his name on the briefing files, but the files hadn't specified that the man in charge was currently holding himself together with nothing but caffeine and what looked like pure, unadulterated spite.

Noel was the eye of the storm. He was mid-twenties, rumpled, and smiling like someone who had learned the expression from a textbook and then practiced it in a mirror until it stopped looking like a threat.

It almost worked.

Eben watched him handle three separate crises in ninety seconds. He redirected a vendor without missing a beat, soothed a mounting argument between two volunteers, and somehow produced a roll of tape from thin air to fix a falling banner.

Efficient. Competent. And absolutely drowning.

Eben knew the signs. He'd made a career of identifying them. The micro-tremor in the hands. The too-bright, bloodshot eyes. The smile that never quite reached the rest of the face, frozen in a mask of "I’m fine."

This was a man holding a falling world together by sheer stubborn refusal to let go. Eben respected the effort, but he hated the waste. It was unsustainable. A failure of resource management.

"Mr. Frost!" Mayor Kringle appeared at his elbow, vibrating with the kind of anxiety that suggested he’d recently swallowed a clock. "You made it! Wonderful! Let me introduce you to—"

"The event coordinator." Eben didn't look up from his clipboard. "Noel Merrick."

"Yes! How did you—"

"Process of elimination." Eben turned to face the mayor, his expression neutral. "You said the festival was understaffed. He's the only one actually directing traffic. Everyone else is just reacting."

Mayor Kringle beamed, relief radiating off him in waves. "Exactly! Which is why we need you. Noel's wonderful, absolutely wonderful, but he's been doing this alone and—well. You'll see."

Eben had already seen. The question wasn't whether Noel needed help, but whether he would accept it without Eben having to dismantle his pride first. Eben had been hired for logistics, but he had a feeling he'd just been drafted for a psychological operation.

He hated those. Logistics were clean. People were messy.

"Does he know I'm coming?"

Mayor Kringle's smile flickered. A classic sign of administrative cowardice. "I... mentioned it."

"When?"

"Just now. Via text."

Eben closed his eyes briefly. "So he doesn't know. You've sent me in as an ambush."

"He knows there's help! He just doesn't know it's... well, a professional of your caliber. Specifically. Yet."

Perfect. Eben was being positioned as the "fixer"—the cold, clinical outsider sent to manage the local hero. It was a role he played often. It was safe. It kept people at a distance. If they resented him for being right, they didn't try to get close.

And Eben needed the distance. Attachment was a promise to lose something, and he’d already lost enough to last a lifetime. Better to be the temporary solution.

"I'll introduce you!" Mayor Kringle said, and before Eben could suggest a more strategic approach, the mayor was already halfway across the floor.

Eben followed, his leather-gloved hands folded behind his back.

Up close, Noel Merrick looked worse. Not bad—he was, objectively, a very handsome man—but he was worn thin. Like a coat that had been through one too many winters. The coffee stain on his collar and the frantic energy in his movements screamed of a man who hadn't slept in two days.

"Noel! This is Eben Frost. He's the help I mentioned!"

Noel's smile didn't waver, but Eben saw the moment the steel slammed down behind his eyes.

"Help." Noel repeated the word as if it were a defeat. 

"Logistics consultant." Eben adjusted his coat. "The mayor hired me to audit and assist with festival operations."

"I'm handling the operations."

"I'm sure you are. The mayor felt a second set of hands might be useful to ensure the launch doesn't implode."

"I have hands." Noel held them up. They were shaking—a fine, persistent tremor. "Two of them. Fully functional."

"They're vibrating."

"Caffeine."

"Exhaustion."

The mayor made a small, strangled sound. "Well! I'll just let you two get acquainted! Eben, Noel will show you around. Noel, Eben is here for the full twelve days, so—"

"Twelve days." Noel made it sound like a prison sentence.

"Merry Christmas!" Mayor Kringle fled.

Silence stretched between them, a cold pocket in the middle of the humid, frantic hall. Noel's smile finally cracked—not broke, but shifted into something sharper, more honest.

"I didn't ask for help."

"I'm aware."

"I don't need help."

"Also aware. You need a replacement for your own failing stamina, but that’s a different conversation."

"Then why are you here, Frost?"

Eben looked at Noel Merrick’s furious, red-rimmed eyes. He decided on the blunt truth. It was more efficient than tact.

"Because the mayor is panicking. Because the festival is objectively understaffed. And because you've been awake for thirty-seven hours and you're currently the single point of failure for this entire town's holiday season."

"Thirty-seven? How did you—"

"I estimated based on the bags under your eyes and the timestamp on the last set of files you uploaded. If you're going to resent me, at least do it for being accurate."

Something almost like a spark of amusement flickered in Eben's chest. He suppressed it immediately.

"Look. I appreciate the concern. But I have this under control."

"Do you. The vendor permits weren't filed, Noel."

Noel's expression went perfectly blank. A wall of denial. 

"I checked with the office on my way here. They open at eight. I have the emergency filing number and the contact for the supervisor. I'll handle it. Now you don't have to."

"I was going to handle that. I had it on my list."

"I'm sure you did. But you're currently arguing with me instead of doing it." Eben adjusted his clipboard. "The sound system has a loose connection on the main board. The volunteer sheets are in storage, second shelf. And you have a ribbon emergency involving chartreuse."

Noel just stared at him.

"I read the briefing file. I've been in this room for five minutes. Do you want to keep protecting your pride, or do you want to save this festival?"

It was harsh. Eben knew it. But drowning people didn't need gentle suggestions; they needed a surface to grab onto. Even if that surface was as cold as ice.

Noel's performer's smile was gone now. What was left was something rawer. More real.

"Fine. You want to help? Start with the booth placement. It's a disaster."

"I noticed."

"Of course you did."

Eben began to pull off his gloves. One finger at a time. A slow, deliberate ritual that marked the transition from observation to action. He watched Noel's eyes track the movement, the younger man's gaze lingering on Eben's bare skin for a beat too long.

"Where do you want me?"

Noel’s expression did something complicated. "Anywhere that's not directly in my way."

"I'll do my best to remain a productive ghost, then."

He meant it as a promise of efficiency. But as he looked at the exhaustion lining Noel's handsome face, he realized that for the next twelve days, staying out of the way was going to be the hardest part of the job.

Because this was temporary. It had to be. Twelve days, then he’d leave before anything took root.

"Temporary," Eben whispered to himself as Noel turned away. It was the most important system he had.
