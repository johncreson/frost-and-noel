# Chapter 7: Evening Save

The lights came on at exactly eight PM.

Noel stood at the edge of Evergreen Square and watched the transformation. One moment, it was a construction zone littered with burnt vinyl and the remnants of a glitter-cannon disaster. The next, it was magic.

Thousands of tiny, warm white lights blazed to life across the square, reflecting off the fresh snow like scattered diamonds. The tree glowed like a celestial beacon. The booths sparkled. Even the replacement inflatable snowman—which Eben had personally vetted for safety—looked almost noble in the golden glow.

The crowd gasped. Then they applauded, a warm, rhythmic sound that rippled through the cold night air.

Noel’s chest did something complicated. A sharp, sparking sensation that was both triumphant and hollow. *One down. Eleven to go.*

"It's beautiful." Mrs. Henderson squeezed Noel’s arm, her eyes reflecting the twinkle of the lights. "Thank you, Noel. I don't know where we'd be without you."

"Just doing my job." Noel smiled automatically.

*Useful Noel. The man this town needs.*

The thought should have been enough. It had been enough for years. But tonight, it felt like a cage. 

"Noel."

Eben was standing three feet away, his charcoal coat stark against the festive backdrop. "We have a problem."

"What kind? The partridges? The power grid?"

"The sound system. The main amplifier is cutting out."

"I thought you checked it twice, Frost."

"I did. It was stable twenty minutes ago. Now it’s not." Eben looked at the crowd, then back at Noel. "I could probably bypass the circuit, but I can't hold the board steady and reach the wiring at the same time."

Noel blinked. "Wait. Are you asking me for...?"

"I need your help, Noel."

The words hit like a physical shock. Eben Frost, the man of infinite systems and clinical precision, was admitting a limitation. He was inviting Noel into the machine.

"Show me."

They moved through the crowd together, a silent, efficient unit. Eben led him behind the main stage to the cramped sound booth. 

"There." Eben pointed to a tangle of wires beneath the heavy mixing board. "The connection is loose. I need you to hold the board upright while I re-seat the terminals."

"That's it? You just need me to be the muscle?"

"I need someone I trust."

Noel froze. The noise of the crowd, the festive music, the chill of the wind—it all faded into the background. *Trust.* Eben had known him for less than fifteen hours, and he was using that word as if it meant everything.

"Okay. Tell me where to hold."

Eben directed him. Noel braced his shoulder against the heavy board, his heart hammering. They were close. Close enough that Noel could feel the heat radiating from Eben’s body, cutting through the winter chill. Close enough to smell the cedar and cold-pine on his skin.

Eben’s hands moved with focused, rhythmic efficiency. He didn't have his gloves on. His fingers were long and sure as he manipulated the wires. Noel watched him, mesmerized by the contrast between the man’s clinical mind and the physical reality of his effort.

"Almost there." Eben’s breath brushed Noel’s ear.

"Got it."

"Done." 

Eben didn't move away immediately. They stayed there for a beat too long, tucked together in the shadows of the booth. Noel could feel the vibration of Eben’s breathing. He looked up, and for a second, the distance between them felt like nothing at all.

"Test it." Eben’s voice was raw.

Noel flipped the master switch. Clean, crisp sound poured through the speakers. 

"Perfect."

"Perfect."

They both stepped back at the same time, the cold air rushing in to fill the space they’d occupied. Eben reached for his gloves, pulling them on with the familiar ritual. Armor back in place.

"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO DAY ONE OF TINSEL TOWN’S TWELVE DAYS OF MAGIC!"

Mayor Kringle’s voice boomed across the square. The crowd’s roar was deafening. 

Noel and Eben moved to the edge of the stage, watching the celebration unfold. Side by side. Not touching, but the awareness of each other was like an electric current. 

"You did it."

"We did it. I had the vision. You fixed the physics."

"A functional partnership."

Noel looked at Eben. The man who treated human attachment like a system error but who had just said *I trust you* in a dark sound booth. 

*I don't want this to be temporary.* The thought crystallized, sharp and terrifying. 

He didn't want to go back to being the only one who carried the weight. He didn't want to go back to being the 'useful' one who lived in the hollow of everyone else’s needs. He wanted the rhythm. He wanted the partnership.

He wanted the man beside him.

"Long day." Eben kept his gaze on the lights.

"Ten more to go."

"Eleven."

"Right. One down." Noel laughed, a short, nervous sound. "Eleven more days of Being Right."

"And then?"

"Then you leave. And I go back to 'handling it.'"

Eben didn't look at him. He just watched the snow fall soft and steady over the crowd. "Yes. That’s the system."

But as Noel watched the lights reflect in Eben’s dark eyes, he knew the system was already failing. Because for the first time in his life, Noel Merrick didn't want to be 'fine.' 

He wanted to be *stays*.
