## Episode 1: Partridge in a Panic
### Compiled Revision 3

# Chapter 1: Cold Open

Noel Merrick had been awake for thirty-seven hours and was handling it fine.

This was a lie, but it was a festive lie, so it was legally tax-deductible.

The Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic was Tinsel Town's holy grail, and right now, the fluorescent lights of the hall buzzed overhead like angry wasps—a sound that vibrated directly against the base of Noel’s skull. It was appropriate. Noel felt like he'd been stung approximately forty-seven times in the last six hours alone. His coffee had gone cold somewhere around crisis number twelve, and his brain currently had the consistency of damp cotton.

"Noel!" A vendor waved frantically from across the main floor. "The sound system's doing the thing again!"

The thing. The thing where it worked perfectly during testing and then developed a death rattle the moment anyone actually needed it. A bit like Noel’s own nervous system.

"On it." Noel called back, the smile clicking into place effortlessly. It was a reflex honed by a lifetime of making sure nobody saw the cracks. He crossed the hall in purposeful strides, though his knees felt like they were held together by aging rubber bands and holiday prayers.

Five forty-seven AM. Still dark outside, the kind of deep, winter dark that suggested the world hadn't actually decided to start yet. The festival officially launched in four hours and thirteen minutes. Noel had approximately ninety-three problems to solve, half of which were currently hidden in the shadows, waiting to pounce.

He could do this. 

He was *fine*.

His hands only shook a little as he crouched beside the sound board. He tucked them into his pockets, squeezing until the tremor subsided. Just the cold. December in Tinsel Town didn't mess around, and Merryweather Hall’s heating system was a relic that produced more noise than actual warmth.

"It's making a clicking sound." Marcus—who ran the candle booth and always smelled faintly of unburnt wick and desperate cinnamon—hovered at his shoulder. "Like a... click. Click. Click."

"I've noticed." Noel smiled wider, the professional mask anchored by pure spite. 

Loose cable. A simple, manageable failure.

"Try it now." Noel tightened the connection, a sharp spike of protest shooting through his stiff lower back. 

Marcus flipped a switch. Clean sound poured through the speakers, drowning out the buzz of the wasp-lights.

"You're a miracle worker. I don't know what this town would do without you, Noel."

Noel's chest did something complicated. A sharp, sparking warmth that was both addictive and exhausting. *What would he be, if he wasn't the one everyone needed?* 

"Just doing my job." The words felt like a shield. If he kept doing the job, he stayed safe. If he stayed useful, he stayed relevant.

He stood, his vision swimming for a brief, dizzying second. His phone buzzed in his pocket. Three times. The rhythm of impending doom.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Noel! Quick question!*
**Mayor Kringle:** *Did we file the vendor permits for Evergreen Square?*
**Mayor Kringle:** *Because I'm looking at the system and I'm not seeing them and I'm sure it's just a glitch but—*

Noel's stomach dropped somewhere in the vicinity of his shoes. 

The permits. 

He remembered the kitchen table. The glow of the laptop. The smell of his third pot of coffee. He’d been right there, cursor hovering over the 'Submit' button, when Mrs. Henderson had called about the wreath delivery catastrophe. He’d tabbed away, and then—the world had kept spinning. He’d forgotten to tap the one button that kept the police from shutting them down.

"Excuse me." Noel nodded to Marcus, the smile still locked in place even as his blood turned to ice. 

He walked very calmly toward the storage room. He made it three steps past the door before he braced both hands on a stack of boxes and allowed his forehead to rest against the cold cardboard. Five seconds. He allowed himself exactly five seconds of silent, screaming panic.

One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

He straightened. His reflection in a nearby window looked like a ghost that had been through a car wash—pale, rumpled, and fundamentally haunted.

He dialed the permit office. Voicemail. Of course. It was 5:50 AM. Normal people were still tucked under duvets, dreaming of sugarplums or at least a full eight hours of REM sleep.

Noel was *fine*. He'd fix this. He always fixed things. That was his value. That was all he had.

His phone buzzed again.

**Wes Candle:** *Saw your car in the lot. Coffee?*
**Noel:** *Yes. Please. IV drip if possible.*
**Wes:** *On it. Also you look like death. Just FYI.*
**Noel:** *Festive death.*
**Wes:** *The best kind.*

Noel pocketed his phone and returned to the main hall. The chaos had multiplied in his absence. The volunteer coordinator had lost the sign-in sheets. Two vendors were currently engaged in a heated debate over whose booth was more "spiritually aligned" with the entrance. Someone’s terrier—Sprinkles—was investigating the buffet with a professional's focus. 

And then there was Hugh.

Hugh Everhart swept into the building wearing what appeared to be a cape made entirely of silver tinsel. He looked like an aggressive disco ball.

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice echoed through the rafters. "Crisis averted! The ribbon shipment arrived!"

"That's great, Hugh—"

"It's the wrong color!"

Of course it was.

"How wrong?" Noel shielded his eyes from the tinsel-glare.

"Chartreuse instead of forest green." Hugh held up a spool, his expression tragic. "Do you know what chartreuse does to a holiday palette, Noel? It’s a crime. A festive felony."

"We'll fix it." Noel kept his voice steady even as his brain cataloged the growing pile of failures. Permits. Ribbons. Dog. Exhaustion. 

"You're a saint!" Hugh swept away in a rustle of metallic fringe.

Saint Noel. Useful Noel. The man who never said no.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Also! Quick thing! I arranged some help for you!*

Noel stared at the screen. The word 'help' felt like an insult. 'Help' meant he wasn't handling it. 'Help' meant the cracks were showing.

**Noel:** *What kind of help?*
**Mayor Kringle:** *You'll see! Should be there soon! Merry Christmas!*

Noel didn't have time for ominous holiday cheer. He caught Sprinkles, returned the dog to a frantic vendor, and was mid-explanation about the spiritual alignment of booth placement when the main doors groaned open.

A draft of freezing winter air sliced through the stale warmth of the hall, carrying the sharp scent of cold pine and impending judgment.

Noel looked up.

The man in the doorway was a stark contrast to the colorful, glitter-stained chaos surrounding him. He was tall, dressed in a charcoal coat that looked tailored to the millimeter. He held a clipboard like a tactical map.

He scanned the room—the bickering vendors, Hugh’s tinsel cape, the dog hair on Noel’s trousers—with the clinical detachment of a surgeon about to begin a difficult operation.

Then his eyes landed on Noel.

Noel, who was currently covered in dog hair and running on thirty-seven hours of desperation. Noel, whose performer's smile was the only thing keeping his face from sliding off.

The man didn't smile. He just assessed. It was cold. It was precise. It was the look of someone who saw exactly how much Noel was struggling.

Noel hated him instantly.

The stranger walked toward him with a measured, rhythmic gait. He stopped exactly three feet away—the precise boundary of professional distance.

"Can I help you?" Noel’s smile was strained but holding.

"I'm here to help you."

His voice was a low, steady baritone, clean and controlled. Like ice.

"I'm handling it." Noel’s grip tightened on his cold coffee. 

The stranger’s gaze flickered to the chaos behind Noel. To the ticking sound system, the missing sheets, the chartreuse ribbons. Then back to Noel's bloodshot eyes.

"That's one word for it."

And Noel knew, with the sinking certainty of a man who'd just hit a very festive iceberg, that this was going to be a very long twelve days. He just had to make sure the "help" didn't see him break.

# Chapter 2: First Meeting

Eben Frost did not believe in chaos.

Chaos was just order that hadn't been properly categorized yet. It was a failure of systems, a breakdown of logic. And Eben was, if nothing else, a man of systems.

The Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic, however, was testing that theory with a dedicated, almost malicious enthusiasm.

Eben stood in the doorway, his leather gloves still on, and conducted a rapid, clinical assessment. Fourteen vendors in various states of logistical meltdown. Structural sound, but the booth placement violated basic traffic flow principles—a bottleneck waiting to happen. Volunteer coordination appeared to be a rumor rather than a reality. Someone had brought a terrier that was currently eyeing a buffet table. And there was a man wearing a cape made of silver tinsel who was, unfortunately, the loudest thing in the room.

And in the center of it all—

Eben's gaze snagged on him immediately.

The event coordinator. Noel Merrick. Eben had seen his name on the briefing files, but the files hadn't specified that the man in charge was currently holding himself together with nothing but caffeine and what looked like pure, unadulterated spite.

Noel was the eye of the storm. He was mid-twenties, rumpled, and smiling like someone who had learned the expression from a textbook and then practiced it in a mirror until it stopped looking like a threat.

It almost worked.

Eben watched him handle three separate crises in ninety seconds. He redirected a vendor without missing a beat, soothed a mounting argument between two volunteers, and somehow produced a roll of tape from thin air to fix a falling banner.

Efficient. Competent. And absolutely drowning.

Eben knew the signs. He'd made a career of identifying them. The micro-tremor in the hands. The too-bright, bloodshot eyes. The smile that never quite reached the rest of the face, frozen in a mask of "I’m fine."

This was a man holding a falling world together by sheer stubborn refusal to let go. Eben respected the effort, but he hated the waste. It was unsustainable. A failure of resource management.

"Mr. Frost!" Mayor Kringle appeared at his elbow, vibrating with the kind of anxiety that suggested he’d recently swallowed a clock. "You made it! Wonderful! Let me introduce you to—"

"The event coordinator." Eben didn't look up from his clipboard. "Noel Merrick."

"Yes! How did you—"

"Process of elimination." Eben turned to face the mayor, his expression neutral. "You said the festival was understaffed. He's the only one actually directing traffic. Everyone else is just reacting."

Mayor Kringle beamed, relief radiating off him in waves. "Exactly! Which is why we need you. Noel's wonderful, absolutely wonderful, but he's been doing this alone and—well. You'll see."

Eben had already seen. The question wasn't whether Noel needed help, but whether he would accept it without Eben having to dismantle his pride first. Eben had been hired for logistics, but he had a feeling he'd just been drafted for a psychological operation.

He hated those. Logistics were clean. People were messy.

"Does he know I'm coming?"

Mayor Kringle's smile flickered. A classic sign of administrative cowardice. "I... mentioned it."

"When?"

"Just now. Via text."

Eben closed his eyes briefly. "So he doesn't know. You've sent me in as an ambush."

"He knows there's help! He just doesn't know it's... well, a professional of your caliber. Specifically. Yet."

Perfect. Eben was being positioned as the "fixer"—the cold, clinical outsider sent to manage the local hero. It was a role he played often. It was safe. It kept people at a distance. If they resented him for being right, they didn't try to get close.

And Eben needed the distance. Attachment was a promise to lose something, and he’d already lost enough to last a lifetime. Better to be the temporary solution.

"I'll introduce you!" Mayor Kringle said, and before Eben could suggest a more strategic approach, the mayor was already halfway across the floor.

Eben followed, his leather-gloved hands folded behind his back.

Up close, Noel Merrick looked worse. Not bad—he was, objectively, a very handsome man—but he was worn thin. Like a coat that had been through one too many winters. The coffee stain on his collar and the frantic energy in his movements screamed of a man who hadn't slept in two days.

"Noel! This is Eben Frost. He's the help I mentioned!"

Noel's smile didn't waver, but Eben saw the moment the steel slammed down behind his eyes.

"Help." Noel repeated the word as if it were a defeat. 

"Logistics consultant." Eben adjusted his coat. "The mayor hired me to audit and assist with festival operations."

"I'm handling the operations."

"I'm sure you are. The mayor felt a second set of hands might be useful to ensure the launch doesn't implode."

"I have hands." Noel held them up. They were shaking—a fine, persistent tremor. "Two of them. Fully functional."

"They're vibrating."

"Caffeine."

"Exhaustion."

The mayor made a small, strangled sound. "Well! I'll just let you two get acquainted! Eben, Noel will show you around. Noel, Eben is here for the full twelve days, so—"

"Twelve days." Noel made it sound like a prison sentence.

"Merry Christmas!" Mayor Kringle fled.

Silence stretched between them, a cold pocket in the middle of the humid, frantic hall. Noel's smile finally cracked—not broke, but shifted into something sharper, more honest.

"I didn't ask for help."

"I'm aware."

"I don't need help."

"Also aware. You need a replacement for your own failing stamina, but that’s a different conversation."

"Then why are you here, Frost?"

Eben looked at Noel Merrick’s furious, red-rimmed eyes. He decided on the blunt truth. It was more efficient than tact.

"Because the mayor is panicking. Because the festival is objectively understaffed. And because you've been awake for thirty-seven hours and you're currently the single point of failure for this entire town's holiday season."

"Thirty-seven? How did you—"

"I estimated based on the bags under your eyes and the timestamp on the last set of files you uploaded. If you're going to resent me, at least do it for being accurate."

Noel flinched, the precision of the hit landing exactly where Eben intended. 

"Accuracy is just one word for being an asshole, Frost."

"In my experience," Eben said, his voice dropping to that glacier-steady baritone, "it's the only word that matters when the alternative is collapse."

Noel stared at him, his mouth tightening into a thin, bitter line. Eben didn't blink. He just waited for the silence to do its work.

"Then be accurate," Noel whispered, the words sharp enough to cut. "Just don't expect me to like it."

"I don't," Eben said. "I expect you to survive."

Eben began to pull off his gloves. One finger at a time. A slow, deliberate ritual that marked the transition from observation to action. He watched Noel's eyes track the movement, the younger man's gaze lingering on Eben's bare skin for a beat too long.

"Where do you want me?"

Noel’s expression did something complicated. "Anywhere that's not directly in my way."

"I'll do my best to remain a productive ghost, then."

He meant it as a promise of efficiency. But as he looked at the exhaustion lining Noel's handsome face, he realized that for the next twelve days, staying out of the way was going to be the hardest part of the job.

Because this was temporary. It had to be. Twelve days, then he’d leave before anything took root.

"Temporary," Eben whispered to himself as Noel turned away. It was the most important system he had.

# Chapter 3: Competence Clash

Noel was going to kill Mayor Kringle.

Not immediately. He had a festival to run, and the paperwork required for a homicide would be a logistical nightmare. But eventually. With something festive. Maybe a sharpened candy cane or a particularly heavy wreath.

He watched Eben Frost cross the hall toward the vendor area. The man moved with a rhythmic, measured precision that suggested he’d never stumbled on a patch of ice or a loose cable in his entire life. He was a machine in a charcoal coat.

"He looks like he alphabetizes his cereal," Noel muttered, taking a desperate gulp of cold coffee. It was a bitter, metallic shock that matched the "accuracy" Frost had just used to dismantle Noel's dignity. "And judges people who don't."

The worst part—the absolutely infuriating part—was that the machine was already working. Eben had known about the permits. He’d known about the sound system rattle. He’d apparently absorbed Noel's sleep-deprived briefing files and turned them into a tactical strategy while Noel was still trying to remember where he’d parked his car.

Competent. The man was terrifyingly competent. And for someone like Noel, who lived and breathed being the one who solved everyone’s problems, that competence felt like a direct assault on his nervous system.

"Noel!" Wes appeared at his elbow, holding a coffee cup the size of a small bucket. "Brought reinforcements for the front lines."

"You're a saint, Wes. Truly." Noel accepted the cup, the heat of it seeping into his chilled, shaking fingers. 

"I'm really not. I just want to make sure you're upright for the opening ceremony." Wes nodded toward the far side of the hall where Eben was speaking to Marcus at the candle booth, which already smelled of unburnt wick and impending prosperity. "So. That's the help."

"Apparently."

"He looks... intense."

"He looks like he's conducting an autopsy on my life choices."

"I was going to say 'sharp,' but sure." Wes leaned against the brick wall, arms folded. He watched the hall with the air of a man settling in for a very entertaining show. "How long do you give it before you two either kiss or commit a felony?"

Noel choked on his coffee, the hot liquid burning his throat. "What? What are you—no. Felony, maybe. The other thing? Absolutely not. We have mutual irritation. That's it."

"Uh-huh." Wes’s smile was a weapon. "He's been staring at you for ten minutes, Noel."

"He's been in the building for ten minutes total, Wes. He’s assessing the room. I’m part of the room."

"He’s looking at you like you’re the most interesting puzzle he’ve ever seen. Trust me. I know the look."

Noel refused to look. He gripped his coffee cup and focused on a distant light fixture. "You're delusional. He thinks I'm a failure of resource management. He told me so."

"And yet, he hasn't looked away." Wes pushed off the wall. "I'll be at the bakery if you need me. Try not to set anything on fire today."

"That was one time! And the snowman was defective!"

"It was three times, and the fire marshal has your picture on a dartboard." 

Wes called the last bit back over his shoulder. Noel stood alone, fuming. He was *fine*. He was the event director. He didn’t need clinical puzzles or intense staring or "help" from a man who treated human interaction like a spreadsheet.

He turned toward the storage room, intent on finding the backup lanterns.

And nearly collided with a wall of charcoal wool.

"Jesus! Do you have to haunt the hall like a Victorian ghost?"

"I walked normally." Eben’s voice was as steady as a glacier. "You were distracted."

"I was paying attention to the ninety-three things currently on my list."

"None of which are currently on fire."

"Give it twenty minutes. Hugh is here."

Eben's expression didn't change, but the slight tightening around his eyes suggested he’d already cataloged Hugh as a significant risk factor. "The vendor placement issue is resolved."

"What? You can't just move booths, Frost. People have contracts. They have—"

"They have a bottleneck that violates fire code." Eben interrupted with the flat certainty of a judge. "I explained the physics of the crowd flow to them. They were both satisfied with the new arrangement once they realized it would double their visibility. No one is blocking the emergency exits anymore."

Noel opened his mouth to argue, then closed it. He’d been planning to handle that. He’d had a whole speech prepared about community cooperation. Eben had just used physics.

"You're welcome."

"I didn't thank you."

"I noticed. Your gratitude seems to be as depleted as your glycogen levels."

"I'm fine." It was a reflex now.

"You're vibrating." Eben’s gaze dropped to Noel’s hands. "Go sit down for ten minutes."

"I have sign-in sheets to find."

"Second shelf. Left side. Behind the extra tinsel."

Noel stared at him, his jaw tight. "How did you find them? I looked for twenty minutes this morning."

"I looked logically."

Of course. Logic. The magic ingredient Noel had apparently forgotten in his thirty-eight hours of wakefulness.

Noel brushed past him into the storage room. He found the sheets exactly where Eben said they would be. He stood in the dim light for a moment, the paper crinkling in his hand. For the first time in years, somebody else was holding the weight.

It should have been a relief. Instead, it felt like being replaced. Like being told he wasn't needed anymore—which, in Noel’s world, was a fate worse than the fire marshal’s dartboard.

When he emerged, Eben was already reorganizing the check-in table. He’d created three distinct stations: Badge Distribution, Assignment Cards, and Emergency Contact. It was beautiful. It was surgical. It was incredibly annoying.

"This is... elaborate." Noel set the sheets down.

"It's efficient." Eben didn't look up from his clipboard.

"Don't let the power go to your head, Frost. It's just badges."

"Badges represent identity and authorization. They are the metadata of the festival."

"Metadata? We're a holiday festival in Tinsel Town, not a tech summit."

"Everything is a system, Noel. Regardless of how much glitter you apply to it."

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice boomed from across the room. "We have a glitter emergency! It’s a level five sparkle disaster!"

"Is anyone bleeding, Hugh?"

"Not physically! But my artistic integrity is hemorrhaging!"

"I'll handle the glitter." Eben stepped away from the table.

"You? You hate glitter. You just called it 'system noise.'"

"I don't hate it. I recognize its properties as a messy, invasive substance. Which is why I will manage it with a controlled containment strategy while you finish the volunteer briefing. This is basic resource allocation."

Noel wanted to argue. He wanted to be the one to save Hugh from his own drama. But Eben was already moving toward Hugh with a determined, clinical air.

"Fine. But if you get a single speck on that coat, don't blame me."

"I won't."

Noel watched him go. Eben Frost was cold, arrogant, and had the social warmth of a frozen pond. But as Noel looked at the perfectly organized check-in table, he felt a strange, nagging sensation in his chest.

He wasn't drowning anymore.

He was just floating. And he wasn't sure if he liked the view.

"Temporary." Noel gripped his coffee cup. "He's only here for twelve days. Then I go back to being the one this town needs."

But as he watched Eben calmly explain the structural properties of glitter to a hysterical Hugh, Noel wasn't sure if he wanted to wait that long.

---

# Chapter 4: Town Watches

By noon, the focus of the Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic had shifted from the humid, tinsel-covered rafters of Merryweather Hall to the icy expanse of Evergreen Square.

Noel stood at the edge of the fountain and tried to remember why he’d thought a twelve-day celebration of human endurance and holiday cliches was a good idea. 

The square was a masterpiece of organized disaster. Wooden booths spiraled out from the center like a slow-motion car crash. Strings of lights lay in tangled heaps on the frozen ground, looking like the shed skins of electric snakes. And in the very middle, a massive Colorado Spruce stood tall, its branches currently bare and appearing somewhat resentful of the proximity to so much glitter.

"It'll come together." Noel whispered to the frost on his breath. "The magic just... hasn't been applied yet."

"Magic is an unreliable variable in a project timeline." 

Noel didn't even jump this time. He just sighed. "You're going to have to stop doing that, Eben. It’s bad for the local morale. People will start thinking the square is haunted by a very well-dressed spirit of Christmas judgment."

"I walk normally." Eben scanned the placement of the hot cocoa station. "The square is naturally acoustic. You’re just—"

"Exhausted? Vibrating? Failing?"

"I was going to say ‘unprotected.’" Eben looked at him then, his eyes dark and unreadable. "You don't have a coat on."

"I have a sweater. It’s festive."

"It’s wool. It’s not windproof. You’re shivering."

"I'm handling it."

"That appears to be your answer to everything. Regardless of the physics involved." 

Before Noel could retort that physics were a secondary concern during a holiday crisis, Wes appeared with a tray of cinnamon-dusted pastries and three steaming cups of something that smelled like heaven and heavy cream.

"Reinforcements!" Wes stepped over a stray length of garland. "I brought sustenance for the survivors. And I see we have a new addition to the Tinsel Town landscape."

Wes turned to Eben, his eyes gleaming with the sharp curiosity that made him the town's unofficial information broker. "Wes Candle. I run the bakery. I also know everyone’s secrets, but I only trade them for high-quality spreadsheets."

"Eben Frost." Eben shook Wes’s hand with a single, efficient pump. "Logistics. And I don’t deal in secrets. Only data."

"Same thing, really. So. The man that Mayor Kringle hired to save Noel from himself. How’s the rescue mission going?"

Noel felt the familiar prickle of irritation. "I don't need saving, Wes. I need the inflatable snowman to stop leaking air."

"I've already patched the snowman." Eben sipped his coffee. "And I'm not here for a rescue mission. I'm here to ensure the internal systems remain functional for the duration of the contract."

"Contract." Wes caught Noel’s eye. "So. Temporary."

"Extremely." Noel said it a little too quickly. 

"Twelve days." Eben added. "Then I leave for Chicago. Clean entry, clean exit."

Wes watched them like a spectator at a tennis match. "Chicago. Right. Well, good luck with the 'clean exit' part. Tinsel Town tends to be a bit... sticky."

"Sticky is just a lack of proper cleaning protocols."

"See?" Noel gestured at Eben. "He’re a delight. He treats human emotion like a spill in aisle four."

Wes just laughed and turned to go. "Try not to set anything on fire, Noel! The town is watching!"

"It was three times, Wes! And the fire marshal said it was a 'statistical anomaly'!"

They stood in silence for a moment as Wes disappeared into the crowd of volunteers. 

"The town *is* watching." Eben looked around the square. 

Noel could see them—the vendors, the volunteers, the families setting up shop. They were all watching him. They were watching the man who had been their anchor for five years. And they were watching the stranger standing beside him. 

The weight of it felt heavier than usual. *I'm lovable when I’m useful,* Noel thought, the mantra a dull ache in his chest. *If I'm not the one fixing everything, who am I to them?*

"They're watching because they want to know if they're safe." Eben said it as if he’d read the tension in Noel’s shoulders. "People in a community like this rely on their leaders for stability. They see you as the stability."

"You think I'm a leader? I thought you think I'm a 'failure of resource management.'"

"A leader who is currently failing at resource management is still a leader. It just means the leader needs a better support system."

"And that’s you? The support system?"

"I'm the logistics. The system is the system." Eben adjusted his clipboard. "I'll handle the tree lighting crew. You go deal with the Mayor. He’s currently explaining the 'spirit of Christmas' to a very confused electrician."

"NOEL!" Mayor Kringle waved from across the square, looking like an anxious marshmallow in his white puffer jacket. "Noel, we have a problem! The power grid is—it’s not festive! It’s making a humming noise!"

"On it." Noel called out, the smile clicking back into place. 

The next three hours were a blur of escalating festive panic. The inflatable snowman—the one Eben had supposedly patched—started listing to the left with a slow, mournful hiss. A vendor brought three dozen live partridges because they’d "misinterpreted the theme," and the birds were currently staging a occupy protest in the main tent. 

And then there was the glitter. 

Hugh had arrived with a literal cannon. "It’s a sparkle surge, Noel! To bless the square!"

"Hugh, don't—"

*FOOMP.*

A cloud of silver glitter erupted into the freezing air, coating everything within a fifty-foot radius. It was beautiful for exactly three seconds. Then the wind picked up.

Noel found himself standing in a blizzard of sparkle. He felt Eben beside him, and for a wild moment, he reached out, his hand brushing Eben’s charcoal sleeve. The fabric was cold, but the arm underneath was solid. A mountain in the middle of a glitter-storm.

"Basic resource allocation." Eben muttered it under his breath, but he didn't move away. 

"We're sparkly, Frost." Noel laughed, a hysterical bubble rising in his throat. "We're competently sparkly."

"I am not sparkly. I am merely reflecting light."

And then, it happened.

A small popping sound from the base of the inflatable snowman. A larger pop. 

"Is that... smoke?"

Noel’s eyes widened. "THE SNOWMAN IS ON FIRE!"

"NOBODY PANIC!" Hugh screamed, which was the universal signal for everyone to lose their minds.

The snowman began to melt in a spectacular, flaming puddle of synthetic vinyl and holiday dreams. The sharp, acrid scent of burnt plastic and chemical pine choked the air—a smell that would haunt the square for a month.

Noel ran toward the fire extinguisher, but he felt a hand on his arm—firm, steady, and wearing a leather glove.

"I have it." 

Eben didn't run. He walked with a purpose. He reached the extinguisher, pulled the pin, and neutralized the flaming Frosty with a clinical efficiency that left the square in a stunned, glittery silence.

Noel stood there, heart hammering, watching Eben return the extinguisher to its stand. 

The town was watching. And they weren't looking at Noel. They were looking at the man who had just saved the square.

"Clean execution." Eben returned to Noel’s side, brushing a final speck of glitter off his coat. "The snowman was defective. I'll file the insurance claim."

Noel looked at the puddle of melted snowman and then at the faces of his neighbors. He felt a sharp, cold hollow opening up inside him. 

"Thanks. Fixed again."

"Just linguistics. Now, we have eleven more hours until the opening. We should probably move the partridges."

Noel followed him, the weight of the "temporary" lie feeling heavier with every step. Eben was here to fix the festival. But Noel was starting to worry that he was the thing that needed fixing the most.

# Chapter 5: First Crack

The inflatable snowman incident had been resolved with minimal property damage and maximum emotional fallout.

Eben stood in the dim, cool air of the storage room behind Merryweather Hall and listened to the silence. It was a reprieve from the square, where the scent of burnt vinyl and aggressive glitter still hung in his nostrils, a persistent reminder of the day's instability.

He’d been hired for logistics. He had not been hired for flaming holiday decor, partridge containment, or managing an event director who treated every failure like a personal indictment of his character. 

And yet.

Eben pulled off his leather gloves. One finger at a time. It was a familiar, grounding ritual that marked the boundary between the performance of efficiency and the reality of existence. He watched his own hands—bare, slightly pale—as if they belonged to someone else.

The Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic was chaos. Noel Merrick was chaos in human form—a man made of caffeine, light, and a desperate, driving need to be the one who fixed everything.

Eben should hate this. He should be counting down the minutes until his flight to Chicago. 

He was not counting. He was remembering the way Noel's hand had felt against his sleeve in the middle of the glitter-storm. A brief, steadying connection that had felt more like a grounding wire than a disruption.

This was a problem.

Eben had built his entire adult life on a single principle: clean execution. Get in, fix the systems, get out before anyone noticed you were there. Before you became a part of the landscape. 

Before you became something that could be missed.

Attachment was a promise to lose something. Eben had learned that lesson in the echoes of a quiet house and the sight of packed boxes. Better to stay on the edges. Better to be the temporary solution than the permanent loss.

Better to keep his gloves on.

He looked at his bare hands. Flexed his fingers, feeling the bite of the winter air that had seeped into the building. 

The door creaked open.

Eben didn't look up immediately. He knew the rhythm of that stride. Frantic but trying to be light. Exhausted but refusing to drag.

Noel stood in the doorway, backlit by the hall's fluorescent hum. He looked... real. The "I’m fine" mask had slipped, leaving behind something raw and fundamentally tired. He looked like a man who had finally realized the world wouldn't end if he stopped smiling for five minutes.

Eben preferred it.

"Sorry. I didn't know anyone was in here. I just needed—" Noel gestured toward the industrial shelving.

"Extension cords."

Noel’s laugh was startled. Genuine. "The snowman incident. That's what we're calling it?"

"It’s more professional than ‘The Great Vinyl Meltdown,’ don't you think?"

"Much more. Adds a layer of dignity to the failure." Noel stepped into the room. His eyes caught on Eben's hands. He stopped, his gaze lingering on the bare skin—bare of the leather, bare of the armor.

Eben should put the gloves back on. He should reclaim the system. 

He didn't. 

"Long day."

"Eleven more to go." Noel leaned against a stack of boxes, his shoulders finally dropping an inch. His sweater brushed against the cold cardboard with a soft, sliding sound.

"Twelve isn't so many."

"You really believe that, don't you? That twelve days is nothing."

"It's a finite period. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. That makes it manageable."

"And after the end?" 

"Fewer with two people."

Noel's expression shifted. The tension in his jaw relaxed, replaced by something soft and dangerously close to trust. "Fewer with two," he agreed.

The silence that followed wasn't the empty silence Eben was used to. It was thick. Charged. Eben was aware of the three feet of space between them. He could see the coffee stain on Noel’s collar, the way a single speck of silver glitter had hooked into his dark hair. 

He wanted to reach out and brush it away. He wanted to close the distance.

Eben didn't move.

"You're good at this."

"At what? Reorganizing storage rooms?"

"At fixing things. At being... the stabilizer." Noel looked down at his own hands, his fingers interlaced tightly. "You came in here and in six hours, you made everything work. You handled Marcus, you handled Hugh, you handled the fire. You handled me."

"I didn't handle you, Noel."

"You did. You made it so I didn’t have to do it all alone. I don't... I’m not used to that."

"I noticed."

"Is it that obvious?"

"You treat every crisis like a personal failure of your character. It’s a very inefficient way to live."

Noel laughed, a short, sharp sound that didn't have any humor in it. "I’m lovable when I’m useful, Eben. If I’m not the one fixing the snowman, what am I?"

Eben looked at the younger man—really looked at the vulnerability he was exposing. It was a breach of protocol. A breakdown of the system.

"You're the person this town loves regardless of the snowman." It was the truth, but saying it felt like a betrayal of his own distance.

"How do you know that? You've been here for six hours."

"I’m an analyst, Noel. I observe patterns. The pattern in Tinsel Town is that everyone looks to you not just for the schedule, but for the permission to be happy. That has nothing to do with whether the lights work."

Noel was quiet for a long beat. "That’s a lot of pressure."

"It is. Which is why you need help."

"Temporary help."

The word landed between them like a physical barrier. The reminder of the system. The promise of the exit.

"Temporary."

Noel’s expression flickered. "Right. Eleven days. Then you go back to Chicago or wherever the next 'clean exit' is."

"That's the job."

"And I go back to managing the sparkle-surges on my own." Noel pushed off the boxes, his mask clicking back into place with a speed that made Eben’s chest ache. "I should get those cords. The mayor is probably vibrating again."

"Noel—"

"Thanks. For the analysis." Noel reached for the cords, his movements quick and professional once more. He paused in the doorway, looking back over his shoulder. "You're not what I expected, Frost."

"Cold and distant?"

"Contained. There's a difference." Noel's gaze dropped to Eben's hands one last time. "You should put your gloves back on. It’s freezing in here."

He left before Eben could respond.

Eben stood alone in the cool darkness. He looked at his bare hands—vulnerable, human, and for the first time in a decade, feeling the absence of a touch he hadn't even received.

Slowly, deliberately, he pulled his gloves back on. One finger at a time. The leather was cold. The armor was heavy.

It didn't help. 

The system was compromised. Noel Merrick had walked through the "temporary" lie like it was made of tinsel and glitter. 

Eben closed his eyes. Eleven days. He just had to survive eleven days of wanting to stay in a place he had no business belonging to. 

"Temporary." 

But as he walked out of the storage room, he knew the data was already beginning to suggest otherwise.

# Chapter 6: Working Together

**NOEL**

They’d developed a rhythm.

It was a terrifying, beautiful thing that Noel hadn’t seen coming. It was the way Eben would already be holding the ladder before Noel realized he needed to reach the top strand of lights. It was the way Noel would finish an explanation to a disgruntled vendor, and Eben would be standing there with the exact form that needed signing.

Efficient. Seamless. And for Noel, fundamentally destabilizing.

"Left side needs more slack." Eben called from across the square. He was adjusting the rigging for the main stage, his movements a masterclass in economy. The 8 PM launch was only four hours away, and the weight of the deadline was beginning to thrum in the air.

Noel adjusted the light strand, the cable cold against his numb palms. "Better?"

"Perfect."

The word hit Noel like a physical weight. *Perfect.* Because that was what they were—a set of gears that finally had enough oil to move without grinding. 

*I'm usually the one who makes things perfect,* Noel thought, watching Eben move. *If he’s here to be the precision, what am I? Just the glitter?*

"Noel!" A volunteer waved from the edge of the square, where the scent of hot cocoa and cinnamon was beginning to overcome the lingering smell of burnt vinyl. "Where do you want the station and the extra heaters?"

Noel opened his mouth to answer, his brain already calculating the foot traffic from the main gate.

"Northeast corner." Eben appeared beside him with the suddenness of a mountain fog. "Best proximity to the seating area without obstructing the view of the tree. Also, it puts the heaters at the windward side to maximize heat retention."

"What he said." Noel’s voice was a little flatter than intended.

The volunteer left, looking much more confident than she had ten seconds ago.

"You have opinions about cocoa station thermodynamics."

"I have opinions about anything involving the conservation of energy."

"I'm starting to think you just enjoy Being Right."

Eben’s mouth twitched—a micro-expression that Noel was learning to recognize as amusement. "I enjoy systems that work, Noel. Being right is just a byproduct of good data."

"I’d appreciate it if you were occasionally wrong. For the sake of my ego."

"I'll take it under advisement."

They stood side by side, watching the square transform. The tree was a pillar of unlit potential. The booths were orderly. It looked like a town that was ready to celebrate, not a town that was about to implode.

"We did this."

"You did the vision." Eben didn't look away from the tree. "I just handled the physics."

"We did it together, Eben. Don't audit the credit."

Eben was quiet for a moment. He looked at Noel, his gaze lingering on the dark circles under Noel’s eyes. "Yes. Together."

Something warm and dangerous unfurled in Noel’s chest. A sense of partnership that he hadn’t felt in years. *Fewer with two,* Eben had said. 

"I should check the sound board."

"I checked it twenty minutes ago. It’s calibrated."

"I... should check it anyway."

"Why?"

*Because I need to not be standing three inches away from you,* Noel thought. *Because you smell like winter and cedar and I’m noticing the way your coat fits your shoulders.*

"Professional thoroughness." Noel’s smile clicked back into place.

Eben’s gaze didn't waver. He didn't believe the lie, but he didn't challenge it. "As you wish."

Noel fled toward the stage, his heart hammering a rhythm that had nothing to do with the festival.

---

**EBEN**

Noel was avoiding him. 

It was a strategic withdrawal, executed with the charm of a professional. A sudden need to audit things that didn't need auditing. A careful preservation of the four-foot boundary between them. 

Eben understood. He was doing the same thing. 

He found himself anticipating Noel’s needs with a precision that was beginning to feel like a vulnerability. He knew when Noel was about to trip over a cable. He knew when Noel’s caffeine had worn off. He knew which vendors made Noel’s smile go brittle.

It was an attachment he hadn’t authorized. 

"Mr. Frost?" A volunteer approached, looking slightly intimidated by his clipboard. "We're not sure about the banner placement."

Eben followed her to the main entrance. "Shift it three feet to the left and raise it eighteen inches. It’ll be visible from the highway entrance without being caught in the crosswinds."

"Oh! That makes sense. You really have an eye for this."

"It’s basic spatial reasoning." Eben’s mind wasn't on the banner. 

He was watching Noel across the square. Noel was laughing with Wes, his head tilted back, the dying sunlight catching the warmth in his face. It was a beautiful sight, and Eben hated how much it made him want to stay.

"Eben!"

He turned. Noel was jogging toward him, looking slightly breathless. 

"We have a problem."

"What kind? Logistics or personality?"

"The mayor. He wants a photo op. With 'The Team.' For the town website."

Eben’s stomach sank. "No."

"I told him no! I told him you were a 'logistics ghost.' He said ghosts don't increase tourism revenue. He’s got the photographer already."

"I don't do public relations, Noel."

"I know. But look at him." Noel pointed toward the center of the square, where Mayor Kringle was bouncing on the balls of his feet. "He’s so excited he might actually pop. And after today... I don't have the energy to fight him."

Eben looked at Noel. Really looked at the exhaustion lining his face. He saw the way Noel was leaning toward him, just slightly, as if seeking a center of gravity.

"One photo."

"Really?"

"One. Then I retreat into the shadows."

"Deal."

They walked toward the mayor. Side by side. Eben found himself matching Noel’s stride without thinking. 

"Perfect!" Mayor Kringle beamed, gesturing them into place in front of the tree. "Just stand together. Look competent! Look festive! Look like the men who saved the Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic!"

"We're just ensuring the launch integrity."

"We’re Being Right." Noel muttered it just for Eben. 

The photographer snapped the picture. 

"Wonderful! You two look like you've been working together for years!"

Eben looked at Noel. They’d been working together for nine hours. But it felt like a system that had always been in place. A rhythm that had been waiting for its second half.

"Can we go now?" 

"Yes, yes! Thank you, boys! The town is going to love this!"

They escaped the mayor’s enthusiasm, retreating toward the quieted edge of the square. 

"The town is going to love it. The 'Team.'"

"It’s a functional partnership. For twelve days."

"Eleven now." Noel didn't move away. 

Eben looked at the lights twinkling across the square—unlit, but ready. At the snow that had begun to fall in soft, silent flakes, coating the charcoal of his coat in a fine white dust. At the man standing beside him who had no idea how much Eben wanted to make day one last forever.

"Eleven more days."

"Temporary." 

"Temporary."

The word was a lie they were both using to protect themselves from the reality of how much it was going to hurt when the twelve days were up. And as Eben stood in the falling snow, he knew he was in significant logistical trouble. 

Because for the first time in ten years, he didn't want a clean exit.

# Chapter 7: Evening Save

The lights came on at exactly eight PM.

Noel stood at the edge of Evergreen Square and watched the transformation. One moment, it was a construction zone littered with burnt vinyl and the remnants of a glitter-cannon disaster. The next, it was magic.

Thousands of tiny, warm white lights blazed to life across the square with a single, synchronized *click* that Noel felt in his very bones. The lights reflected off the fresh snow like scattered diamonds. The tree glowed like a celestial beacon. The booths sparkled. Even the replacement inflatable snowman—which Eben had personally vetted for safety—looked almost noble in the golden glow, its top hat secured by a thick, defiant bow of chartreuse ribbon.

Noel smiled. The chartreuse was hideous, a crime against holiday tradition, but in the glow of the square, it looked like a victory lap. Eben had suggested using it for structural reinforcement. Noel had turned it into a statement.

The crowd gasped. Then they applauded, a warm, rhythmic sound that rippled through the cold night air.

Noel’s chest did something complicated. A sharp, sparking sensation that was both triumphant and hollow. *One down. Eleven to go.*

"It's beautiful." Mrs. Henderson squeezed Noel’s arm, her eyes reflecting the twinkle of the lights. "Thank you, Noel. I don't know where we'd be without you."

"Just doing my job." Noel smiled automatically.

*Useful Noel. The man this town needs.*

The thought should have been enough. It had been enough for years. But tonight, it felt like a cage. 

"Noel."

Eben was standing three feet away, his charcoal coat stark against the festive backdrop of the Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic. "We have a problem."

"What kind? The partridges? The power grid?"

"The sound system. The main amplifier is cutting out."

"I thought you checked it twice, Frost."

"I did. It was stable twenty minutes ago. Now it’s not." Eben looked at the crowd, then back at Noel. "I could probably bypass the circuit, but I can't hold the board steady and reach the wiring at the same time."

Noel blinked. "Wait. Are you asking me for...?"

"I need your help, Noel."

The words hit like a physical shock. Eben Frost, the man of infinite systems and clinical precision, was admitting a limitation. He was inviting Noel into the machine.

"Show me."

They moved through the crowd together, a silent, efficient unit. Eben led him behind the main stage to the cramped sound booth. 

"There." Eben pointed to a tangle of wires beneath the heavy mixing board. "The connection is loose. I need you to hold the board upright while I re-seat the terminals."

"That's it? You just need me to be the muscle?"

"I need someone I trust."

Noel froze. The noise of the crowd, the festive music, the chill of the wind—it all faded into the background. *Trust.* Eben had known him for less than fifteen hours, and he was using that word as if it meant everything.

"Okay. Tell me where to hold."

Eben directed him. Noel braced his shoulder against the heavy board, his heart hammering. They were close. Close enough that Noel could feel the heat radiating from Eben’s body, cutting through the winter chill. Close enough to smell the cedar and cold-pine on his skin.

Eben’s hands moved with focused, rhythmic efficiency. He didn't have his gloves on. His fingers were long and sure as he manipulated the wires. Noel watched him, mesmerized by the contrast between the man’s clinical mind and the physical reality of his effort.

"Almost there." Eben’s breath brushed Noel’s ear.

"Got it."

"Done." 

Eben didn't move away immediately. They stayed there for a beat too long, tucked together in the shadows of the booth. Noel could feel the vibration of Eben’s breathing. He looked up, and for a second, the distance between them felt like nothing at all.

"Test it." Eben’s voice was raw.

Noel flipped the master switch. Clean, crisp sound poured through the speakers. 

"Perfect."

"Perfect."

They both stepped back at the same time, the cold air rushing in to fill the space they’d occupied. Eben reached for his gloves, pulling them on with the familiar ritual. Armor back in place.

"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO DAY ONE OF TINSEL TOWN’S TWELVE DAYS OF MAGIC!"

Mayor Kringle’s voice boomed across the square. The crowd’s roar was deafening. 

Noel and Eben moved to the edge of the stage, watching the celebration unfold. Side by side. Not touching, but the awareness of each other was like an electric current. 

"You did it."

"We did it. I had the vision. You fixed the physics."

"A functional partnership."

Noel looked at Eben. The man who treated human attachment like a system error but who had just said *I trust you* in a dark sound booth. 

*I don't want this to be temporary.* The thought crystallized, sharp and terrifying. 

He didn't want to go back to being the only one who carried the weight. He didn't want to go back to being the 'useful' one who lived in the hollow of everyone else’s needs. He wanted the rhythm. He wanted the partnership.

He wanted the man beside him.

"Long day." Eben kept his gaze on the lights.

"Ten more to go."

"Eleven." Eben corrected him instantly, no heat in it. Just the fact.

"Right. One down." Noel laughed, a short, nervous sound. "Eleven more days of Being Right."

"And then?"

"Then you leave. And I go back to 'handling it.'"

Eben didn't look at him. He just watched the snow fall soft and steady over the crowd. "Yes. That’s the system."

But as Noel watched the lights reflect in Eben’s dark eyes, he knew the system was already failing. Because for the first time in his life, Noel Merrick didn't want to be 'fine.' 

He wanted to be *stays*.

# Chapter 8: Hook Ending

The hall was finally quiet.

Eben stood in the center of Merryweather Hall and listened to the silence. It was a cold, hollow sound, missing the frantic energy of the day, missing the shouting vendors and Hugh’s glitter-cannon booms and Mayor Kringle’s anxious questions.

It was just the two of them.

Across the room, Noel was huddled over the volunteer schedule for tomorrow. The harsh fluorescent lights overhead buzzed with that familiar, wasp-like anger, washing out the warmth in his face. It was a stark contrast to the diamond-glow of the square six hours ago. He looked like a man who was only held together by the ink on his clipboard.

Eben should leave. His contract for Day One was complete. The systems for the Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic were stable. The equipment was secured. He had no logistical reason to remain in this building.

He didn't move.

"I think that’s everything." Noel looked up, his voice faint, stripped of its performer's charm. 

"The permits are finalized." Eben’s voice sounded too loud in the empty hall. "The volunteer schedule is optimized for the morning rush. The emergency protocols are in place."

"So we're done."

"For today."

"Right. For today."

Silence returned, heavier than before. Noel set down his clipboard with a clatter that echoed through the rafters. He crossed the floor, stopping at the three-foot boundary—the clinical line Eben had drawn this morning.

The distance felt like a failure of geometry.

"So. Tomorrow."

"Tomorrow."

"Same time? Six AM?"

"I’ll be here."

Noel blinked, a flicker of surprise breaking through the exhaustion. "You don't have to be. I can handle the morning setup. I’ve done it for years."

"I don't do things out of obligation, Noel. I do them because they are necessary for the integrity of the project."

"And I'm part of the project?"

"You are the center of it."

Noel looked at him then, his gaze heavy and searching. "That sounds a lot like you care about the person, Frost. Not just the data."

Eben felt the familiar tightening in his chest—the warning system. *Attachment destroys what you build.*

"I care about the outcome."

"Right. The outcome." Noel laughed quietly, a bitter sound that didn't suit him. "Eleven more days of outcomes. Then you leave."

"That is the arrangement."

"Back to the 'clean exits.' Back to the apartment that isn't a home."

Eben tightened his grip on his own clipboard. "It’s efficient. It prevents unnecessary complications."

"Efficiency isn’t the same as living, Eben. I thought you were an analyst."

"I am."

"Then analyze why you’re still standing here instead of going to your hotel."

Eben didn't have an answer that fit into a spreadsheet. He was standing here because the thought of walking out those doors and leaving Noel alone in this hollow hall felt like a logistical catastrophe. He was standing here because the 'temporary' lie was beginning to taste like ash.

"This is temporary." Eben’s voice was hard.

Noel flinched, a small, barely visible motion that hit Eben harder than the snowman fire. "I know. Just for the festival."

"Twelve days."

"Eleven now." Noel stepped back, his voice small but the math finally accurate. He’d apparently absorbed Eben’s earlier correction. "Then you leave, and I go back to being the one this town needs. Alone."

"You have the town, Noel. You have Wes. You have Hugh."

"I have a lot of people who need me, Eben. That’s not the same as having someone who stays."

The honesty of it was a breach of every boundary Eben had ever built. He wanted to close the distance. He wanted to say that eleven days was a lifetime if you measured it in something other than minutes. He wanted to say *I'll stay*.

He didn't. 

Because everything ended. Every project closed. Every city faded into the rearview mirror. That was the only system that never failed.

"I should go."

"Yeah. Me too."

"Six AM. Don't be late."

"I’m never late, Frost. I’m just 'spiritually delayed.'"

Noel smiled then—the first version of his real smile that Eben had seen since the storage room. It was soft, tired, and absolutely devastating.

Eben turned and walked out of the hall without looking back.

The winter air hit him like a physical blow, carrying the scent of cold pine and distant woodsmoke. The streets of Tinsel Town were quiet, the festive lights reflecting on the fresh snow like scattered diamonds. It was beautiful. It was magic. It was a nightmare.

Eben sat in his car and stared at the dark windshield. He looked at his leather gloves—the armor he’d put back on the moment they’d left the sound booth. 

*I trust you*, he had said. 

It was a catastrophic failure of logic.

"Temporary." He whispered it to the dashboard. 

The word didn't mean anything anymore. 

Because as he started the engine and drove through the quiet, twinkling streets, Eben Frost knew the truth. Noel Merrick had walked through his defenses with a smile and a "glitter emergency" and a heart that was too large for his own good. And Eben, the man of clean exits and efficient systems, was already beginning to realize that the hardest part of the twelve days wasn't going to be the work.

It was going to be the leaving.

He drove home through the snow, the feeling of Noel's shoulder against his in the sound booth still a ghost-warmth in his mind. 

Eleven more days. 

It was too much time. It wasn't nearly enough. 

And as the snow covered Tinsel Town in a blanket of white, Eben Frost finally admitted the data point he had been trying to ignore.

He wasn't here to save the festival. He was here to find a reason to stay. 

And that was the most terrifying thing of all.
