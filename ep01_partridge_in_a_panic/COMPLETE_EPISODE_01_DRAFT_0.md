# Chapter 1: Cold Open

Noel Merrick had been awake for thirty-seven hours and was handling it fine.

This was a lie, but it was a festive lie, so it counted.

The Merryweather Hall's fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like angry wasps, which was appropriate, because Noel felt like he'd been stung approximately forty-seven times in the last six hours alone. His coffee had gone cold somewhere around crisis number twelve. He'd lost track after that.

"Noel!" A vendor waved frantically from across the main floor. "The sound system's doing the thing again!"

The thing. Yes. The thing where it worked perfectly during testing and then developed a death rattle the moment anyone actually needed it.

"On it," Noel called back, smile firmly in place, and crossed the hall in what he hoped looked like purposeful strides rather than the caffeinated stumble it actually was.

Five forty-seven AM. Still dark outside. The festival didn't officially start until ten, which meant he had exactly four hours and thirteen minutes to solve approximately ninety-three problems, half of which he didn't know existed yet.

He could do this.

He was *fine*.

His hands only shook a little as he crouched beside the sound board, and that was probably just the cold. December in Tinsel Town didn't mess around. The hall's heating system was older than most of the volunteers, and about as reliable.

"It's making a clicking sound," the vendor—Marcus, ran the candle booth—said helpfully. "Like a... click. Click. Click."

Noel resisted the urge to point out that yes, clicking sounds did tend to go *click*. Instead, he smiled wider and checked the connections.

Loose cable. Of course.

"Should be good now," he said, tightening it. "Try it?"

Marcus flipped a switch. Clean sound poured through the speakers.

"You're a miracle worker," Marcus said, relief flooding his face.

Noel's chest did something complicated. Warm and tight and *necessary*.

"Just doing my job," he said, and meant it in ways that probably required therapy to unpack.

He stood, knees protesting, and his phone buzzed in his pocket. Three times. Which meant either someone was very excited or something was very wrong.

Historically, in Noel's life, it was always the latter.

He pulled out his phone.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Noel! Quick question!*

**Mayor Kringle:** *Did we file the vendor permits for Evergreen Square?*

**Mayor Kringle:** *Because I'm looking at the system and I'm not seeing them and I'm sure it's just a glitch but—*

Noel's stomach dropped somewhere in the vicinity of his shoes.

The permits.

The permits he'd *definitely* filed. Two weeks ago. He remembered doing it. He'd been at his kitchen table, laptop open, form filled out, submit button clicked—

Except.

Except he'd gotten a call halfway through. Mrs. Henderson, panicking about the wreath delivery. And he'd tabbed away to check the schedule, and then—

Oh no.

"Excuse me," Noel said to Marcus, smile still locked in place, and walked very calmly toward the storage room.

He made it three steps past the door before he braced both hands on a stack of boxes and allowed himself exactly five seconds of silent, screaming panic.

One.

Two.

Three.

Four.

Five.

He straightened. Pulled out his phone. Dialed the permit office.

Voicemail. Of course. It was 5:50 AM. Normal people weren't awake yet.

Normal people also didn't run twelve-day holiday festivals that the entire town depended on for tourism revenue and general Christmas spirit.

Noel was *fine*.

He'd fix this. He always fixed things. That was what he *did*. That was what made him—

Useful.

Valuable.

Worth keeping around.

His phone buzzed again.

**Wes Candle:** *Saw your car in the lot. Coffee?*

Noel could have kissed him. Platonically. Gratefully. Desperately.

**Noel:** *Yes. Please. IV drip if possible.*

**Wes:** *On it. Also you look like death. Just FYI.*

**Noel:** *Festive death.*

**Wes:** *The best kind.*

Noel pocketed his phone and returned to the main hall, where approximately six new problems had sprouted like particularly aggressive weeds.

The volunteer coordinator couldn't find the sign-in sheets. Two vendors were arguing about booth placement. Someone's dog had gotten loose and was currently investigating the buffet table with great enthusiasm. And Hugh Everhart had just entered the building in what appeared to be a cape made entirely of silver tinsel.

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice carried across the hall like a glittery foghorn. "Crisis averted! The ribbon shipment arrived!"

"That's great, Hugh—"

"It's the wrong color!"

Of course it was.

"How wrong?" Noel asked, already crossing toward him.

"Chartreuse instead of forest green." Hugh held up a spool like it had personally offended him. "Do you know what chartreuse does to a color palette?"

"Crimes against Christmas?" Noel guessed.

"*Exactly.*"

Noel added it to the mental list. Permits. Sound system (fixed). Dog (ongoing). Ribbons (catastrophic, apparently). Volunteers (missing). His own will to live (debatable).

"I'll call the supplier," he said.

"You're a saint," Hugh declared, and swept away in a cloud of tinsel and drama.

Noel's phone buzzed.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Also! Quick thing! I arranged some help for you!*

Noel stared at the message.

Help.

He didn't need help. He needed permits and sleep and possibly a vacation, but he didn't need *help*. He had this under control.

Mostly.

Technically.

**Noel:** *What kind of help?*

**Mayor Kringle:** *You'll see! Should be there soon! Merry Christmas!*

That was ominous.

Noel didn't have time for ominous.

He pocketed his phone, grabbed the runaway dog (a terrier named Sprinkles, because of course), returned her to her apologetic owner, and was halfway through explaining the booth placement situation when the main doors opened.

Cold air rushed in.

And someone new stepped through.

Noel looked up.

The man in the doorway was tall. Neat. Wearing a charcoal coat that probably cost more than Noel's car, and he held a clipboard like it was a weapon.

He looked at the chaos of Merryweather Hall—the scattered volunteers, the arguing vendors, Hugh's tinsel cape, the dog situation—with the expression of someone conducting a very thorough autopsy.

Then his eyes landed on Noel.

Noel, who hadn't slept in thirty-seven hours. Noel, whose shirt was wrinkled and whose hair was doing something unforgivable. Noel, who was smiling so hard his face hurt because that was what you did when everything was falling apart.

The man's expression didn't change.

But something in his eyes did.

Assessment, Noel thought. Cold. Clinical.

He hated it immediately.

The man walked toward him with the kind of deliberate precision that suggested he'd measured the distance first.

"Can I help you?" Noel asked, smile firmly in place.

The man stopped exactly three feet away. Close enough to be professional. Far enough to avoid any actual warmth.

"I'm here to help you," the man said.

His voice was winter itself. Crisp. Clean. Controlled.

Noel's smile didn't waver.

"I'm handling it," he said.

The man looked at the chaos again. The vendors. The dog. Hugh, who was now arguing with someone about glitter density.

Then he looked back at Noel.

"That's one word for it," he said.

And Noel knew, with the certainty of someone who'd been running on spite and caffeine for thirty-seven hours straight, that this was going to be a very long twelve days.

# Chapter 2: First Meeting

Eben Frost did not believe in chaos.

Chaos was just order that hadn't been properly categorized yet.

The Merryweather Hall, however, was testing that theory.

He stood in the doorway and conducted a xrapid assessment: Fourteen vendors in various states of setup. Structural sound, but the booth placement violated basic traffic flow principles. Volunteer coordination appeared nonexistent. Someone had brought a dog. There was a man wearing what appeared to be a cape made of tinsel.

And in the center of it all—

Eben's gaze snagged on him immediately.

The event coordinator. Had to be. He was the eye of the storm, the point everyone orbited around. Mid-twenties, maybe. Rumpled shirt. Exhausted eyes. And a smile that looked like it had been applied with a trowel and sheer force of will.

He smiled like someone who had learned to do it from a book and then practiced until it stopped looking terrifying.

It almost worked.

Eben watched him handle three separate crises in ninety seconds: redirecting a vendor, soothing an argument, and somehow producing a roll of tape from thin air. Efficient. Competent.

Running on fumes.

Eben knew the signs. The micro-tremor in the hands. The too-bright eyes. The smile that never quite reached the rest of his face.

This was a man holding everything together through sheer stubborn refusal to let go.

Eben understood that. Respected it, even.

It was also completely unsustainable.

"Mr. Frost!" Mayor Kringle appeared at his elbow like a anxious Christmas ghost. "You made it! Wonderful! Let me introduce you to—"

"The event coordinator," Eben said, still watching the man in the center of the chaos. "Noel Merrick."

"Yes! How did you—"

"Process of elimination." Eben turned to face the mayor. "You said the festival was understaffed and over-ambitious. He's the only one managing the entire floor."

Mayor Kringle beamed like Eben had just solved world hunger. "Exactly! Which is why we need you. Noel's wonderful, absolutely wonderful, but he's been doing this alone and—well. You'll see."

Eben had already seen.

The question was whether Noel Merrick would accept help, or whether this was going to be twelve days of managing someone else's pride while also managing a festival.

Eben had been hired for logistics. He had a feeling he'd just been drafted for diplomacy.

He hated diplomacy.

"Does he know I'm coming?" Eben asked.

Mayor Kringle's smile flickered. "I... mentioned it."

"When?"

"Just now. Via text."

Eben closed his eyes briefly. Opened them. "So he doesn't know."

"He knows there's help! He just doesn't know it's... you. Specifically. Yet."

Perfect.

Eben had been hired to fix a festival. Apparently, he'd also been hired to ambush someone who clearly didn't want to be fixed.

"I'll introduce you!" Mayor Kringle said brightly, and before Eben could suggest literally any other approach, the mayor was already crossing the floor.

Eben followed, because the alternative was standing in the doorway like a particularly judgmental statue.

Up close, Noel Merrick looked worse.

Not bad. Just—worn. Like a coat that had been through one too many winters. His eyes were bloodshot. There was a coffee stain on his collar. And his smile, which had seemed merely professional from a distance, was absolutely screaming for mercy up close.

"Noel!" Mayor Kringle said. "This is Eben Frost. He's the help I mentioned!"

Noel's smile didn't waver. But something behind his eyes went very, very still.

"Help," he repeated.

"Logistics consultant," Eben clarified. "The mayor hired me to assist with festival operations."

"I'm handling the operations," Noel said.

His voice was pleasant. Warm, even. But there was steel underneath.

Eben respected that too.

"I'm sure you are," Eben said. "The mayor felt a second set of hands might be useful."

"I have hands." Noel held them up, as if providing evidence. "Two of them. Fully functional."

"They're shaking," Eben observed.

Noel's hands immediately dropped. The smile stayed fixed.

"Caffeine," he said.

"Exhaustion," Eben corrected.

The mayor made a small, nervous sound. "Well! I'll just let you two get acquainted! Eben, Noel will show you around. Noel, Eben is here for the full twelve days, so—"

"Twelve days," Noel said flatly.

"Merry Christmas!" Mayor Kringle fled.

Eben didn't blame him.

Silence stretched between them. Around them, the chaos of the hall continued—vendors shouting, someone hammering something, the dog barking—but in their small bubble of space, it was very, very quiet.

Noel's smile finally cracked.

Not broke. Just—shifted. Into something sharper.

"I didn't ask for help," he said.

"I'm aware."

"I don't need help," he said.

"Also aware."

"Then why are you here?"

Eben considered his options. He could be diplomatic. Reassuring. He could ease into this with tact and sensitivity.

He looked at Noel Merrick's exhausted, furious eyes and decided on honesty.

"Because the mayor is panicking," Eben said. "Because the festival is understaffed. And because you've been awake for at least thirty-six hours and you're running on spite and coffee."

Noel blinked. "Thirty-seven."

"Excuse me?"

"Thirty-seven hours. If you're going to assess me, at least be accurate."

Something almost like amusement flickered in Eben's chest. He ignored it.

"Thirty-seven," he agreed. "My mistake."

Noel stared at him. Eben stared back.

This was, Eben reflected, possibly the worst introduction he'd ever had. And he'd once been hired to reorganize a library where the head librarian communicated exclusively through hostile sticky notes.

"Look," Noel said finally. "I appreciate the mayor's... concern. But I have this under control."

"Do you."

"Yes."

"The vendor permits weren't filed."

Noel's expression went very carefully blank. "How did you—"

"The mayor mentioned it. I called the permit office on my way here. They open at eight. I have the emergency filing number."

Noel's jaw tightened. "I was going to handle that."

"I'm sure you were. Now you don't have to."

"I don't need you to—"

"The sound system has a loose connection in the main board," Eben continued. "The volunteer sign-in sheets are in the storage room, second shelf. And someone ordered chartreuse ribbon instead of forest green."

Noel just stared at him.

"I read the briefing file," Eben said. "And I've been here for five minutes. Do you want to keep arguing about whether you need help, or do you want to save this festival?"

It was harsh. Eben knew it was harsh.

But Noel Merrick was drowning, and drowning people didn't respond well to gentle suggestions. They responded to life preservers.

Even if they resented the person throwing them.

Noel's smile had vanished completely now. What was left was something rawer. More real.

Eben preferred it.

"Fine," Noel said. "You want to help? Start with the booth placement. It's a disaster."

"I noticed."

"Of course you did."

Eben pulled off his gloves. One finger at a time. Deliberate. Controlled.

He didn't miss the way Noel's eyes tracked the movement.

"Where do you want me?" Eben asked.

Noel's expression did something complicated.

"Anywhere that's not directly in my way," he said finally.

Eben almost smiled.

Almost.

"I'll do my best," he said.

And he meant it as a promise.

Or possibly a threat.

With Noel Merrick, he suspected it might be both.

# Chapter 3: Competence Clash

Noel was going to kill Mayor Kringle.

Not immediately. He had a festival to run. But eventually. With something festive. Maybe a candy cane. Those were surprisingly sharp if you broke them right.

He watched Eben Frost cross the hall toward the vendor area, moving with the kind of deliberate precision that suggested he'd never stumbled in his life.

The man had the energy of someone who alphabetized his underwear and judged people silently for not doing the same.

Noel hated him.

Except.

Except he'd known about the permits. And the sound system. And he'd apparently read the entire briefing file, which Noel himself had written at two AM in a fugue state of exhaustion and spite.

Competent, Noel thought grimly. The man was competent.

This was inconvenient.

"Noel!" Wes appeared at his elbow with a coffee cup the size of a small bucket. "Brought reinforcements."

"You're a saint," Noel said, accepting it gratefully.

"I'm really not." Wes nodded toward Eben. "So. That's the help."

"Apparently."

"He looks..."

"Like he's conducting an autopsy on my life choices?"

"I was going to say 'intense,' but sure."

Noel took a long drink of coffee. It was perfect. Wes always knew his order. Three shots, oat milk, enough sugar to constitute a health hazard.

"Mayor Kringle hired him without telling me," Noel said.

"Classic Kringle." Wes leaned against the wall, watching the hall with the air of someone settling in for a show. "How long do you give it before you two either kiss or commit murder?"

Noel choked on his coffee. "What?"

"I'm just saying. There's a vibe."

"The vibe is mutual irritation."

"Uh-huh." Wes's smile was infuriating. "He's been staring at you for ten minutes."

"He's been here for ten minutes total."

"My point exactly."

Noel refused to look. He absolutely refused to—

He looked.

Eben was across the hall, talking to a vendor. Not looking at Noel at all.

"You're delusional," Noel told Wes.

"And you're deflecting." Wes pushed off the wall. "I'll be at the bakery if you need me. Try not to set anything on fire."

"That was one time!"

"It was three times."

"The third one doesn't count. That was Hugh's fault."

"Everything is Hugh's fault," Wes agreed, and left.

Noel stood alone with his coffee and his dignity, both of which were running low.

He should get back to work. There were approximately ninety problems that needed solving, and standing around thinking about Eben Frost's staring habits—which Wes had definitely imagined—wasn't solving any of them.

He turned toward the storage room.

And nearly collided with Eben.

"Jesus!" Noel stumbled back, coffee sloshing. "Do you have to sneak up on people?"

"I walked normally," Eben said. "You weren't paying attention."

"I was paying attention to the ninety-three things currently on fire."

"Nothing is literally on fire."

"Give it time."

Eben's expression didn't change, but something in his eyes might have been amusement. It was hard to tell. The man's face was a fortress.

"The vendor placement issue is resolved," Eben said.

Noel blinked. "What?"

"The two vendors arguing about booth location. I moved them."

"You can't just—"

"I already did. They're both satisfied with the new arrangement. Traffic flow is improved. No one is blocking the emergency exits anymore."

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it.

He'd been planning to handle that. After the permits. And the ribbons. And the seventeen other things on his list.

"You're welcome," Eben said.

"I didn't thank you."

"I noticed."

They stared at each other.

This was ridiculous. Eben had solved a problem. That was good. That was helpful. Noel should be grateful.

He was not grateful.

He was annoyed that he hadn't solved it himself.

"The volunteer sign-in sheets," Noel said. "You said they were in storage?"

"Second shelf. Left side."

"How did you—"

"Logical placement based on accessibility and frequency of use."

Of course.

Noel brushed past him toward the storage room, very carefully not noticing the way Eben stepped aside at exactly the right moment, or the way the air felt different in the space where they'd almost touched.

Professional awareness. That was all. He was aware of where his colleague was. Completely normal.

He found the sign-in sheets exactly where Eben said they'd be.

He hated that.

When he emerged, Eben was reorganizing the volunteer check-in table. Without being asked. Just—doing it.

"Do you ever stop?" Noel asked.

Eben looked up. "Stop what?"

"Fixing things."

"Do you?"

Fair point.

Noel set down the sheets. Eben had already created a system: sign-in, badge distribution, assignment cards. It was efficient. Logical.

Annoying.

"This is good," Noel admitted grudgingly.

"Thank you."

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Wouldn't dream of it."

Was that sarcasm? It was hard to tell. Eben's voice was so carefully controlled that emotion had to fight its way through layers of frost to reach the surface.

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice carried across the hall. "We have a glitter emergency!"

"Is anyone bleeding?" Noel called back.

"Not yet!"

"Then it's not an emergency!"

"It's EMOTIONALLY an emergency!"

Noel closed his eyes briefly. Opened them. "I should—"

"Handle the glitter crisis," Eben finished. "I'll manage the volunteer check-in."

"You don't have to—"

"I'm already here. You're needed elsewhere. This is basic resource allocation."

Noel wanted to argue. He really did.

But Hugh was waving frantically, and there was glitter literally everywhere, and Eben was right.

He hated that Eben was right.

"Fine," Noel said. "But don't reorganize anything else without asking."

"I'll try to restrain myself."

Definitely sarcasm that time.

Noel crossed the hall to deal with Hugh's glitter crisis, which turned out to be both more and less serious than advertised. Yes, there was glitter everywhere. No, it wasn't fixable. Glitter was eternal. Glitter was inevitable.

"It's fine," Noel told Hugh. "We'll just... embrace the sparkle."

"You're a visionary," Hugh declared.

"I'm tired."

"Same thing, really."

By the time Noel returned to the check-in table, Eben had processed six volunteers, assigned them all to appropriate stations, and somehow acquired a second clipboard.

"You have a clipboard," Noel observed.

"I brought it with me."

"Of course you did."

"Organization is important."

"So is spontaneity."

"Spontaneity is just poor planning with better marketing."

Noel stared at him. "Did you just—was that a joke?"

"No."

"It sounded like a joke."

"I don't joke."

"Everyone jokes."

"I don't."

Noel studied him. Eben's expression was perfectly neutral. But there was something in his eyes. A flicker. A spark.

"You're messing with me," Noel said.

"I wouldn't dare."

Definitely messing with him.

Noel felt something dangerous happen in his chest. Something warm and inconvenient.

He shoved it down.

"I'm going to check on the sound system," he said.

"I already checked it. It's fine."

"I'm going to check it anyway."

"Suit yourself."

Noel fled.

Not fled. Walked purposefully. Toward the sound system. Which was fine, exactly as Eben had said.

He stood there for a moment, staring at the perfectly functional equipment, and tried to figure out what was happening.

Eben Frost was competent. Efficient. Possibly the most organized human being Noel had ever encountered.

He was also annoying. Presumptuous. And he kept fixing things before Noel could fix them himself.

And Noel was—

Not grateful.

Not interested.

Not noticing the way Eben moved through space like he'd measured it first, or the way his voice did something complicated to Noel's pulse, or the way he'd looked when he'd taken off his gloves—

Noel was fine.

Completely fine.

He just needed more coffee.

And possibly a new personality.

"Noel?" A volunteer appeared. "There's a problem with the—"

"On it," Noel said, and dove gratefully back into the chaos.

Where he belonged.

Where he was useful.

Where he definitely wasn't thinking about Eben Frost's hands.

---

# Chapter 4: Town Watches

By noon, they'd moved operations to Evergreen Square.

Noel stood at the edge of the plaza and tried to remember why he'd thought this was a good idea.

The festival. The twelve days. The entire elaborate production that was supposed to put Tinsel Town on the map and boost winter tourism and make everyone's Christmas magical.

Right now, it looked like a construction zone had a baby with a craft store explosion.

Booths in various states of assembly. Lights tangled in heaps. Someone's inflatable snowman listing sadly to one side. And in the center of it all, a massive Christmas tree that was supposed to be the festival's crown jewel but currently looked like it had lost a fight with gravity.

"It'll come together," Noel told himself.

"Will it?"

Noel jumped. Eben had appeared beside him like a particularly judgmental ghost.

"Do you have to do that?" Noel demanded.

"Do what?"

"Materialize. Silently. Like you're auditioning for a horror movie."

"I walked normally. Again."

"You walk like a cat. It's unnerving."

Something flickered in Eben's expression. "I've been called worse."

Noel wanted to ask what, exactly, but Wes chose that moment to arrive with a tray of pastries and an expression that meant trouble.

"Gentlemen," Wes said, in the tone of someone about to cause problems on purpose. "I brought sustenance."

"You're a saint," Noel said, reaching for a croissant.

"So I've been told." Wes turned to Eben. "We haven't been properly introduced. Wes Candle. I run the bakery on Main Street."

"Eben Frost." Eben shook his hand with the kind of precision that suggested he'd calculated the exact amount of pressure required.

"The logistics consultant," Wes said.

"Yes."

"Interesting."

"Is it?"

"Very." Wes's smile was dangerous. "Noel doesn't usually accept help."

"I noticed."

"And yet here you are."

"Here I am."

They looked at each other. Noel had the distinct impression he was watching some kind of silent negotiation happening in a language he didn't speak.

"Well," Wes said finally. "Good luck."

"With the festival?" Eben asked.

"Sure. Let's go with that." Wes turned to Noel. "I'll be at the coffee station if you need me. Try not to set anything on fire."

"It was three times and you need to let it go," Noel called after him.

Wes just waved.

Eben was looking at him.

"I don't want to know," Eben said.

"Probably for the best."

They stood in silence for a moment, watching the chaos of the square. Volunteers swarmed like particularly festive ants. Someone was arguing about light placement. The inflatable snowman had given up entirely and was now just a sad puddle of vinyl.

"This is going to be a disaster," Noel said.

"Yes," Eben agreed.

Noel looked at him. "You're supposed to say something reassuring."

"I don't do reassuring. I do realistic."

"Realistic is depressing."

"Realistic is honest."

"I hate that you're right."

"You'll get used to it."

Noel absolutely would not get used to it.

"NOEL!" Mayor Kringle appeared like a anxious whirlwind. "How's it going? Is everything on schedule? It looks wonderful! Is it wonderful? It's going to be wonderful, right?"

"It's going to be fine," Noel said, smile clicking into place.

"Fine! Yes! Fine is good! Fine is—" The mayor looked at Eben. "You're helping, right? You're helping him?"

"I'm attempting to," Eben said.

"Wonderful! You two make a great team! Very efficient! Very—" The mayor gestured vaguely. "—intense. In a good way! A productive way!"

Noel's smile felt like it might crack his face. "We're managing."

"Managing! Perfect! I'll just—I have a thing—" Mayor Kringle fled toward a group of volunteers.

Silence.

"He's terrified," Eben observed.

"He's always terrified. It's his natural state."

"And yet he's the mayor."

"Democracy is a beautiful disaster."

Eben's mouth twitched. It might have been a smile. It was hard to tell.

"Noel!" Hugh appeared in a cloud of silver and determination. "I need your opinion on the ribbon situation!"

"I thought we resolved the ribbon situation."

"We resolved the color crisis. Now we have a texture emergency."

"How is texture an emergency?"

"Satin versus grosgrain. It's a matter of structural integrity."

Noel looked at Eben. Eben looked back.

"I'll handle the tree lighting," Eben said.

"You don't have to—"

"Ribbon emergencies are outside my expertise."

"Everything is outside Hugh's definition of emergency."

"Then you're the right person for the job."

Hugh grabbed Noel's arm. "Come! We must consult!"

Noel let himself be dragged away, but not before catching Eben's expression.

Was that amusement?

It was definitely something.

The ribbon consultation took twenty minutes and involved more opinions about textile physics than Noel thought possible. By the time he escaped, the square had transformed.

Booths were upright. Lights were strung. The tree looked less like it was plotting revenge and more like an actual Christmas tree.

And Eben was in the center of it all, directing volunteers with quiet efficiency.

Noel watched him work.

He moved like he'd choreographed it. Every gesture deliberate. Every instruction clear. And people listened. Not because he was loud or commanding, but because he was certain.

Competent, Noel thought again.

Annoyingly competent.

"He's good," Wes said, appearing at Noel's elbow.

"He's adequate."

"He's been staring at you for the last ten minutes."

"He has not."

"He looked over here six times. I counted."

"You have too much free time."

"I have the perfect amount of free time." Wes handed him a coffee. "You like him."

"I tolerate him."

"Same thing."

"It's really not."

"Noel." Wes's voice went serious. "When's the last time you let someone help you?"

Noel's chest did something complicated. "I let people help all the time."

"You let people need you. That's different."

"It's the same thing."

"It's really not."

Noel took a long drink of coffee. It was perfect. It was always perfect. Wes knew his order. Wes knew him.

"I'm fine," Noel said.

"You're exhausted."

"I'm functional."

"You're running on fumes and spite."

"It's gotten me this far."

Wes sighed. "Just—try not to push him away, okay? He's trying."

"I'm not pushing anyone away."

"You're doing that thing where you smile and deflect."

"This is just my face."

"This is your 'I'm fine' face. It's different from your actual face."

"I don't have multiple faces."

"Everyone has multiple faces. Yours just happen to all be variations of 'I'm handling it.'"

Noel wanted to argue. He really did.

But across the square, Eben looked up. Their eyes met.

And Noel forgot what he was going to say.

Eben held his gaze for a beat too long. Then nodded. Once. Deliberate.

Noel nodded back.

"See?" Wes said. "Staring."

"That was eye contact. Professional eye contact."

"Uh-huh."

"It was!"

"Whatever you say." Wes patted his shoulder. "I'll be at the bakery. Try not to—"

"Set anything on fire, I know."

"I was going to say 'overthink it,' but sure."

Wes left.

Noel stood alone with his coffee and his thoughts, both of which were becoming problematic.

He wasn't overthinking anything.

He was just—aware. Professionally aware. Of his colleague. Who was competent and efficient and possibly the most organized human being on the planet.

That was all.

Completely normal.

"Noel!" A volunteer waved. "We have a problem with the—"

There was a small popping sound.

Then a larger popping sound.

Then the distinct smell of burning plastic.

Noel turned slowly.

The inflatable snowman was on fire.

"NOBODY PANIC!" Hugh shouted, which immediately made everyone panic.

Noel ran.

---

# Chapter 5: First Crack

The inflatable snowman incident had been resolved with minimal property damage and maximum chaos.

Eben stood in the storage room behind Merryweather Hall and tried to process the last six hours.

He'd been hired for logistics.

He had not been hired for flaming snowmen, glitter emergencies, or managing a festival director who ran on caffeine and sheer stubborn refusal to admit defeat.

And yet.

Eben pulled off his gloves. One finger at a time. The familiar ritual helped him think.

The festival was chaos. Noel Merrick was chaos in human form.

Eben should hate this.

He did not hate this.

This was a problem.

Eben had built his entire adult life on a simple principle: clean execution. Get in, fix the problem, get out before it became something he couldn't leave.

Before it became something that could leave him.

Attachment was a promise to lose something. Eben had learned that lesson early and well. Better to stay on the edges. Better to be useful without being necessary.

Better to keep his gloves on.

He looked at his bare hands. Flexed his fingers.

The door opened.

Eben looked up.

Noel stood in the doorway, backlit by the hall's fluorescent lights. He looked—

Terrible. Wonderful. Exhausted.

Real.

His performer's smile was gone. What was left was something rawer. More honest.

Eben preferred it.

"Sorry," Noel said. "I didn't know anyone was in here. I just needed—"

He gestured vaguely at the shelves.

"Extension cords," Eben supplied.

"How did you—"

"You're replacing the ones that melted in the snowman incident."

Noel's laugh was startled. Genuine. "The snowman incident. That's what we're calling it?"

"Would you prefer 'The Great Inflatable Disaster of December Fourteenth'?"

"That's better. More dramatic." Noel stepped into the room. His eyes caught on Eben's hands. Lingered.

Eben should put his gloves back on.

He didn't.

"Long day," Eben said.

"Twelve more to go," Noel replied.

"Twelve isn't so many."

Noel looked at him. Really looked. Like he was trying to figure out a puzzle.

"You really believe that," Noel said.

"I do."

"Why?"

Because I'm counting them, Eben thought. Because every day with you is one day closer to the end, and I'm already dreading it.

He didn't say that.

"Fewer with two people," he said instead.

Noel's expression shifted. Softened.

"Fewer with two," he agreed quietly.

The silence stretched. Not uncomfortable. Just—present.

Eben was aware of the space between them. Three feet. Maybe less. Close enough to see the coffee stain on Noel's collar. Close enough to count the shadows under his eyes.

Close enough to want to close the distance.

Eben didn't move.

"You're good at this," Noel said suddenly.

"At what?"

"Fixing things. Organizing chaos. Being—" Noel gestured. "—competent."

"It's my job."

"It's more than that." Noel leaned against the doorframe. "You actually care. About getting it right."

"Don't you?"

"I care about people being happy. That's different."

"Is it?"

"You tell me."

Eben considered. "I think they're connected. People are happy when things work. Things work when someone cares about the details."

"That's very logical."

"I'm a very logical person."

"I noticed." Noel's smile was small. Tired. Real. "It's annoying."

"I've been told."

"By who?"

"Everyone I've ever worked with."

Noel laughed again. The sound did something dangerous to Eben's carefully controlled composure.

"I should get those extension cords," Noel said.

He didn't move.

Neither did Eben.

"Noel," Eben said.

It was the first time he'd used Noel's first name. Not Merrick. Not "the event coordinator."

Just Noel.

Noel's eyes widened slightly. "Yeah?"

"When did you last sleep?"

"I don't remember. That's probably bad, right?"

"That's very bad."

"I'll sleep in January."

"That's not sustainable."

"It's sustained me this far."

"That's not the same thing."

Noel pushed off the doorframe. Crossed to the shelves. Found the extension cords.

When he turned back, he was closer. Close enough that Eben could see the exact shade of brown in his eyes. Warm. Like coffee. Like cinnamon.

"You don't have to worry about me," Noel said.

"I'm not worried. I'm concerned. Professionally."

"Professionally."

"Yes."

"Right." Noel's smile turned wry. "Because we're professionals."

"We are."

"Working together."

"Temporarily."

The word landed between them like a stone.

Noel's expression flickered. "Temporarily," he repeated.

"Twelve days."

"Then you leave."

"Then I leave."

"And I go back to doing this alone."

Eben's chest tightened. "You won't be alone. You'll have the volunteers. The town. You'll—"

"I'll be fine," Noel finished. "I know. I'm always fine."

He said it like a mantra. Like something he'd repeated so many times it had worn grooves in his mind.

Eben recognized it. The lie people told themselves to keep moving.

He'd told himself the same lie for years.

"Noel—"

"I should get back." Noel moved toward the door. "Thanks. For today. For helping."

"You don't have to thank me."

"I know. But I'm going to anyway." Noel paused in the doorway. Looked back. "You're not what I expected."

"What did you expect?"

"Someone more..." Noel gestured vaguely. "Cold. Distant. You know. Frost."

"I am cold and distant."

"You're really not."

"I'm very controlled."

"That's different." Noel's smile was soft. Dangerous. "Control isn't the same as cold."

He left before Eben could respond.

Eben stood alone in the storage room, extension cords forgotten, and tried to remember why he'd taken this job.

Clean execution. That was why. Get in, fix the festival, get out.

Don't get attached.

Don't let it become something you can't leave.

Don't—

Eben looked at his bare hands.

Slowly, deliberately, he pulled his gloves back on.

One finger at a time.

Armor back in place.

It didn't help.

He could still feel the warmth of Noel's smile. Could still hear the way he'd said "fewer with two" like it meant something.

Could still see the exhaustion in his eyes and the stubborn set of his jaw and the way he'd looked at Eben's hands like—

Like—

Eben closed his eyes.

Twelve days.

He could do twelve days.

He'd done harder things.

He just had to remember: this was temporary. Everything was temporary. That was the rule. That was how he stayed safe.

That was how he kept from losing anything else.

"Temporary," Eben said to the empty room.

It tasted like a lie.

He left the storage room and returned to the chaos, where Noel was already solving three problems at once with a smile that didn't reach his eyes.

And Eben, despite every rule he'd ever made for himself, wanted to fix that too.

# Chapter 6: Working Together

**NOEL**

They'd developed a rhythm.

Noel wasn't sure when it happened. Somewhere between the snowman incident and the light rigging crisis. Somewhere between Eben handing him coffee without being asked and Noel knowing exactly which clipboard Eben needed before he asked for it.

It was efficient.

It was dangerous.

"Left side needs more slack," Eben called from across the square.

Noel adjusted the light strand. "Better?"

"Perfect."

Perfect. Right. Because they were perfect at this. At working together. At moving through the chaos like they'd choreographed it.

This is fine, Noel thought. This is just efficiency. We're just efficient.

"Noel!" A volunteer waved. "Where do you want the hot cocoa station?"

Noel opened his mouth to answer.

"Northeast corner," Eben said, appearing beside him. "Better traffic flow. Closer to the seating area."

"What he said," Noel agreed.

The volunteer left.

Noel looked at Eben. "You have opinions about cocoa station placement."

"I have opinions about everything."

"I've noticed."

"Is that a problem?"

"It's..." Noel searched for the word. "Unexpected."

"You expected me to be less opinionated?"

"I expected you to be less right about everything."

Eben's mouth twitched. "I'll try to be wrong occasionally. For variety."

"I'd appreciate that."

They stood side by side, watching the square transform. Booths were complete. Lights were strung. The tree was upright and decorated. It actually looked like a festival.

It actually looked like it might work.

"We did this," Noel said quietly.

"You did most of it."

"We did it together."

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "Yes. We did."

Something warm unfurled in Noel's chest. Something dangerous and inconvenient and absolutely not allowed.

He shoved it down.

"I should check on the sound system," Noel said.

"I checked it twenty minutes ago. It's fine."

"I should check it anyway."

"Why?"

Because I need to not be standing next to you right now, Noel thought. Because you smell like winter and something clean and I'm noticing it and that's a problem.

"Professional thoroughness," Noel said.

"Uh-huh."

Eben definitely didn't believe him.

Noel fled anyway.

---

**EBEN**

Noel was avoiding him.

Eben knew the signs. The sudden need to check things that didn't need checking. The careful maintenance of physical distance. The way Noel's smile clicked into place whenever they got too close.

Eben understood.

He was doing the same thing.

They were both very good at avoidance.

"Mr. Frost?" A volunteer approached. "We're not sure about the banner placement."

Eben followed her to the main entrance, where two volunteers were debating the merits of various hanging angles.

"Higher," Eben said. "And shift it three feet left. Better sight lines from the street."

They adjusted. It was perfect.

"You're really good at this," one of the volunteers said.

"It's basic spatial reasoning."

"It's more than that. You just—see things. How they should be."

Eben didn't know how to respond to that.

He'd always seen things. Patterns. Systems. The way pieces fit together. It was how his mind worked. How he'd survived.

How he'd stayed alone.

"Thank you," he said finally.

The volunteer smiled and left.

Eben stood alone, looking at the banner. The festival. The town square transformed into something magical.

He'd done this. With Noel.

They'd done this together.

The thought should have been neutral. Professional.

It wasn't.

"Eben!"

He turned. Noel was jogging toward him, slightly breathless.

"We have a problem," Noel said.

"What kind of problem?"

"The good kind. The mayor wants to do a photo op. With both of us. For the town website."

Eben's stomach sank. "Both of us."

"Apparently we're 'the team that saved the festival.'" Noel's expression was complicated. "I tried to tell him it was premature, but he's already got the photographer."

"I don't do photo ops."

"I told him that. He said 'everyone does photo ops.'"

"I'm not everyone."

"I noticed." Noel's smile was wry. "But he's the mayor. And he's excited. And honestly, after today, I don't have the energy to argue."

Eben looked at him. Really looked.

Noel was exhausted. Running on fumes. But there was something else in his eyes now. Something that hadn't been there this morning.

Hope.

"Fine," Eben said.

"Really?"

"One photo. Then I'm done."

"Deal."

They walked toward where Mayor Kringle was setting up with a photographer. Side by side. Close enough that their arms almost brushed.

Eben was very aware of the distance.

Very aware of how easy it would be to close it.

"Just stand together!" Mayor Kringle directed. "Look competent! Festive! Competently festive!"

"That's not a thing," Noel muttered.

"We're making it a thing," Eben muttered back.

Noel laughed. Quiet. Genuine.

The photographer snapped the picture.

"Perfect!" Mayor Kringle beamed. "You two are naturals!"

"We're really not," Noel said.

"Nonsense! You work together beautifully! Like you've been doing this for years!"

They'd been doing this for eight hours.

Eight hours that felt like longer. Like something that had weight. Like something that mattered.

Eben didn't like how much it mattered.

"Can we go now?" he asked.

"Yes, yes! Thank you! This is wonderful! The town will love this!"

They escaped.

---

**NOEL**

The evening rush hit like a tidal wave.

Last-minute vendor questions. Volunteer coordination. Equipment checks. A thousand tiny details that needed handling before tomorrow's opening.

Noel handled them.

With Eben.

They moved through the chaos like dancers. Noel would start toward a problem, and Eben would already be solving it. Eben would need something, and Noel would have it ready.

It was seamless.

It was terrifying.

"Extension cord," Eben said, hand out.

Noel handed it to him without looking.

"How did you know I needed that?" Eben asked.

"You were looking at the light strand. It's too short. Extension cord was the logical next step."

"That's very logical of you."

"I'm learning from the master."

Eben's expression did something complicated. "I'm not a master."

"You're something."

Their eyes met.

Held.

Noel forgot what he was going to say.

"Noel!" Hugh appeared like a glittery comet. "Final ribbon approval needed!"

The moment broke.

Noel turned away, heart doing something irregular in his chest.

This was fine.

This was just adrenaline. Just the stress of the day. Just—

Just Eben's hand steadying him when he stumbled over a cable.

Just Eben's voice, quiet and certain, saying "I've got it" when Noel was drowning.

Just Eben, looking at him like he saw past the smile to the exhaustion underneath.

This was fine.

Noel was fine.

He just needed to survive eleven more days.

---

**EBEN**

By seven PM, the square was ready.

Eben stood at the edge and conducted a final assessment. Booths: secure. Lights: functional. Sound system: operational. Volunteers: briefed. Emergency protocols: established.

It was done.

They'd done it.

"It looks good," Noel said, appearing beside him.

"It looks functional."

"Same thing."

"Not quite."

"Close enough." Noel was quiet for a moment. Then: "Thank you. For today. I couldn't have done this without you."

"You could have."

"I would have. That's different."

Eben looked at him. "Is it?"

"Yeah." Noel's smile was soft. Tired. Real. "One is surviving. The other is—"

"Living?"

"Something like that."

They stood in silence, watching the lights twinkle across the square. Snow had started falling. Soft. Gentle. Perfect.

Eben hated how perfect it was.

Hated how right it felt to be standing here, next to Noel, watching something they'd built together.

Hated how much he wanted to stay.

"Tomorrow," Noel said quietly.

"Tomorrow," Eben agreed.

"Same time?"

"Same time."

Noel turned to face him. "This is temporary. Just for the festival."

"Temporary," Eben repeated.

The word sat between them like a lie they both needed to believe.

"Right," Noel said. "Temporary."

He didn't sound convinced.

Neither was Eben.

But they both nodded, and smiled, and pretended that twelve days was enough time to build something and not enough time to break when it ended.

And Eben, standing in the snow with Noel Merrick beside him, knew with absolute certainty that he was in trouble.

---

# Chapter 7: Evening Save

The lights came on at exactly eight PM.

Noel stood at the edge of Evergreen Square and watched the transformation.

One moment: construction zone. Chaos. Potential disaster.

The next: magic.

Thousands of tiny white lights blazed to life across the square. The tree glowed like a beacon. The booths sparkled. Even the sad inflatable snowman—replaced after the incident—looked dignified in the golden light.

The crowd that had gathered gasped.

Then applauded.

Noel's chest did something complicated.

They'd done it.

Day one.

One down. Eleven to go.

"It's beautiful," someone said.

Noel turned. An older woman stood beside him, eyes bright with tears.

"Thank you," Noel said automatically.

"No, thank *you*. This town needed this. We all needed this."

She squeezed his arm and moved into the crowd.

Noel stood very still and tried not to feel the weight of that.

Needed.

He was needed.

That should feel good. That should feel like enough.

It felt like drowning.

"Noel."

Eben's voice. Quiet. Close.

Noel turned. Eben stood three feet away, hands in his pockets, expression unreadable.

"We have a problem," Eben said.

Of course they did.

"What kind of problem?" Noel asked.

"The sound system. It's cutting out."

"I thought you checked it."

"I did. It was fine twenty minutes ago."

"And now?"

"Now it's not."

Noel looked at the crowd. At the mayor, who was preparing to give his opening speech. At the photographer, ready to capture the moment.

At the festival that was supposed to be perfect.

"How bad?" Noel asked.

"Fixable. But we need to do it now."

"Can you—"

"I need your help."

Noel blinked. Eben Frost, who had spent the entire day fixing things independently, needed his help.

"Okay," Noel said. "Show me."

They moved through the crowd together. Eben led him to the sound booth, tucked behind the main stage.

"There," Eben said, pointing to a tangle of cables. "Something's loose. But I can't reach it and hold the board steady at the same time."

"So you need—"

"Someone to hold the board while I fix the connection."

"You need me to hold something."

"Yes."

"That's it?"

"That's it."

Noel stared at him. "You could have asked any volunteer."

"I asked you."

"Why?"

Eben was quiet for a moment. Then: "Because I trust you."

The words hit like a physical thing.

Trust.

Eben Frost, who had known him for less than twelve hours, trusted him.

"Okay," Noel said quietly. "Tell me what to do."

Eben directed him. Noel held the board steady. Eben's hands moved with precise efficiency, tightening connections, testing cables.

They were close. Close enough that Noel could feel the warmth of Eben's shoulder against his. Close enough to smell whatever clean, winter scent Eben used.

Close enough to be dangerous.

"Got it," Eben said.

He didn't move away.

Neither did Noel.

"Test it," Eben said.

Noel flipped the switch. Clean sound poured through the speakers.

"Perfect," Noel said.

"Perfect," Eben agreed.

They were still close. Still not moving.

Noel could feel his pulse in his throat. Could feel the cold air and the warm lights and Eben, solid and certain beside him.

"We should—" Noel started.

"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!" Mayor Kringle's voice boomed through the speakers. "WELCOME TO THE FIRST ANNUAL TWELVE DAYS OF TINSEL TOWN FESTIVAL!"

The crowd cheered.

The moment broke.

Eben stepped back. Put his gloves on. One finger at a time.

Armor back in place.

"We should watch," Eben said.

"Yeah," Noel agreed.

They moved to the edge of the crowd. Side by side. Not touching.

Mayor Kringle gave his speech. Something about community and tradition and the magic of Christmas. Noel had heard it before. Had probably written half of it.

But standing here, watching the lights reflect on the snow, feeling the warmth of the crowd and the cold of the air and Eben's presence beside him—

It felt different.

It felt real.

"You did this," Eben said quietly.

"We did this," Noel corrected.

"You had the vision. I just helped execute it."

"You did more than that."

"Did I?"

Noel looked at him. Eben was watching the crowd, expression neutral. But there was something in his eyes. Something soft.

"Yeah," Noel said. "You did."

The mayor finished his speech. The crowd applauded. Music started playing—something festive and warm.

A few couples started dancing.

Noel watched them and felt something ache in his chest.

"Long day," Eben said.

"Twelve more to go."

"Eleven."

"What?"

"Eleven more. We finished day one."

"Right." Noel laughed quietly. "Eleven more."

"That's not so many."

"You keep saying that."

"Because it's true."

"Or because you're trying to convince yourself."

Eben looked at him. Really looked.

"Maybe both," he said.

The honesty of it hit Noel sideways.

"Eben—"

"We should go," Eben said. "Final check of the hall. Make sure everything's locked down for tomorrow."

He was retreating. Noel could see it. The walls going back up. The distance being reestablished.

He should let him.

He should maintain his own distance.

He should not be noticing the way the lights caught in Eben's dark hair, or the way his voice went softer when he was tired, or the way he'd said "I trust you" like it cost him something.

"Yeah," Noel said. "Let's go."

They walked back to Merryweather Hall in silence. The crowd's noise faded behind them. The streets were quiet. Snow fell soft and steady.

It was peaceful.

It was terrifying.

Because Noel realized, somewhere between the hall and the square, between the chaos and the lights, between the morning's friction and the evening's trust—

He didn't want this to be temporary.

And that was a problem.

Because Eben Frost was here for twelve days. Eleven now.

And then he'd leave.

And Noel would go back to doing this alone.

Like always.

Useful. Needed. Alone.

He looked at Eben, walking beside him in the snow, and tried to remember why that had ever been enough.

He couldn't.

And that was the most terrifying thing of all.

---

# Chapter 8: Hook Ending

The hall was quiet.

Eben stood in the center of Merryweather Hall and listened to the silence.

No vendors. No volunteers. No Hugh with his glitter emergencies or Mayor Kringle with his anxious hovering.

Just Noel, across the room, checking the volunteer schedule for tomorrow.

Just the two of them.

Just the question that hung in the air like snow waiting to fall: what now?

Eben should leave. The day was done. The festival was launched. His job for today was complete.

He didn't leave.

"I think that's everything," Noel said, looking up from his clipboard.

"The vendor permits are filed," Eben confirmed. "The volunteer schedule is set. The equipment is secured."

"So we're done."

"For today."

"Right. For today."

Silence.

Noel set down his clipboard. Crossed the room. Stopped a careful three feet away.

The distance felt deliberate.

"So," Noel said. "Tomorrow."

"Tomorrow," Eben agreed.

"Same time?"

"What time do you usually start?"

"Six AM."

"Then six AM."

Noel blinked. "You don't have to—"

"I'll be here."

"Eben—"

"Unless you don't want me here."

"That's not—" Noel ran a hand through his hair. "I just don't want you to feel obligated."

"I don't do things out of obligation."

"Then why?"

Because I want to, Eben thought. Because today was chaos and exhausting and the most alive I've felt in years. Because you make me want to stay, and that terrifies me, and I'm doing it anyway.

He didn't say any of that.

"Because the job isn't finished," he said instead.

"Right. The job."

"Eleven more days."

"Eleven more days," Noel repeated. His expression was complicated. "And then?"

"Then the festival ends. And I leave."

"Back to—where, exactly?"

"Wherever the next job is."

"You don't have a home base?"

"I have an apartment. That's not the same thing."

Noel looked at him like he was trying to solve a puzzle. "That sounds lonely."

"It's efficient."

"That's not the same thing either."

"Isn't it?"

"No." Noel's voice was soft. Certain. "It's really not."

Eben should argue. Should maintain the distance. Should remember that this was temporary and temporary meant safe and safe meant—

Alone.

Always alone.

"This is temporary," Eben said.

The words came out harder than he meant them to.

Noel flinched. Just slightly. But Eben saw it.

"Right," Noel said. "Temporary. Just for the festival."

"Just for the festival."

"Twelve days."

"Eleven now."

"Eleven." Noel's smile was brittle. "Then you leave, and I go back to doing this alone."

"You won't be alone. You'll have—"

"The volunteers. The town. I know." Noel's laugh was quiet. Bitter. "I'll be fine."

There it was again. That word.

Fine.

The lie Noel told himself. The lie Eben recognized because he'd told himself the same one for years.

"Noel—"

"It's okay." Noel stepped back. Creating more distance. "I get it. This is a job. You're here to do a job. And when it's done, you leave. That's how it works."

"Yes."

"So. Temporary."

"Temporary."

They looked at each other.

Eben wanted to close the distance. Wanted to say that temporary didn't have to mean nothing. That eleven days could matter. That—

He didn't.

Because eleven days did mean nothing. In the grand scheme of things. In the long run.

Eleven days was just enough time to want something and not enough time to keep it.

Eben knew that better than anyone.

"I should go," Eben said.

"Yeah. It's late."

"Tomorrow. Six AM."

"I'll be here."

"So will I."

Noel nodded. Smiled. It didn't reach his eyes.

Eben turned toward the door.

"Eben?"

He stopped. Looked back.

Noel was backlit by the hall's fluorescent lights. Exhausted. Beautiful. Real.

"Thank you," Noel said. "For today. I know I was—resistant. At first. But you—" He gestured vaguely. "You helped. A lot. So. Thank you."

"You're welcome."

"And I'm sorry. If I was difficult."

"You weren't difficult. You were drowning."

Noel's expression cracked. Just for a moment. Just enough for Eben to see the truth underneath.

"Yeah," Noel said quietly. "I was."

"You're not anymore."

"Because of you."

"Because of us."

The word hung between them.

Us.

Like they were a unit. A team. Like they were something more than a temporary arrangement.

"Us," Noel repeated. "For eleven more days."

"Eleven more days."

"Right."

Eben should leave. Should walk out the door. Should maintain the boundaries he'd spent years building.

"Noel," he said instead.

"Yeah?"

"This—" Eben gestured between them. "Whatever this is. It doesn't have to be—"

He stopped.

Because what was he going to say? It doesn't have to be temporary? It doesn't have to end?

That was a lie.

Everything ended.

Everything left.

That was the rule.

"Never mind," Eben said.

"Eben—"

"I'll see you tomorrow."

He left before Noel could respond.

The cold air hit him like a slap. Snow was still falling. The streets were empty. Quiet.

Eben walked to his car and sat in the driver's seat and stared at the dark windshield.

Temporary.

He'd said it like a promise. Like a boundary. Like a rule that would keep him safe.

It tasted like a lie.

Because the truth was, Eben had spent the entire day watching Noel Merrick smile and solve problems and refuse to admit he was drowning. Had spent the entire day wanting to fix things for him. Had spent the entire day feeling something he'd promised himself he wouldn't feel.

Attachment.

The thing that destroyed. The thing that left. The thing that hurt.

Eben had built his entire life around avoiding it.

And in one day, Noel Merrick had walked through every defense like they were made of paper.

"Temporary," Eben said to the empty car.

The word echoed.

He started the engine. Pulled out of the parking lot. Drove through the quiet streets of Tinsel Town with its twinkling lights and its Christmas magic and its festival that he'd helped save.

With Noel.

Eleven more days.

Eleven more days of working beside him. Of watching him smile. Of wanting to close the distance and knowing he couldn't.

Eleven more days of pretending this was just a job.

Eleven more days of lying to himself.

Eben drove home through the snow and tried to remember why he'd taken this job in the first place.

Clean execution. That was why. Get in, fix the problem, get out.

Before it became something he couldn't leave.

Too late, a voice whispered in his head.

Too late.

Outside, the snow was falling on Tinsel Town, covering everything in white. Making it clean. Making it new.

And Eben Frost sat in his apartment and stared at his gloves—armor, carefully maintained—and knew with absolute certainty that nothing about this was going to be temporary at all.

He just had to figure out what to do about it.

Eleven days.

It wasn't enough time.

It was too much time.

It was all the time he had.

And Eben, who had spent years perfecting the art of leaving, realized he had no idea how to stay.

But he was going to try.

Starting tomorrow.

At six AM.

When Noel would be there, smiling his exhausted smile, running on spite and coffee and sheer stubborn refusal to ask for help.

And Eben would be there too.

Because temporary or not, eleven days or not, job or not—

He wasn't ready to leave.

Not yet.

Maybe not ever.

And that was the most terrifying thing of all.
