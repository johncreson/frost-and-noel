# Continuity Assessment & Transition Plan

## 1. Internal Continuity Audit

### The "Day Countdown" Math
There is a consistent discrepancy in how Noel and Eben count the remaining days of the festival.
- **Fact**: Episode 1 is Day 1 of 12 (Dec 14). There are **11 days** remaining after Day 1 concludes.
- **Current Errors**:
    - **Ch 5**: Noel says "Twelve more to go." (Implying 12 starting tomorrow, which is 13 total).
    - **Ch 6**: Noel says "Ten now. Since day one is almost over." (Errors: 12 - 1 = 11).
    - **Ch 7**: Noel says "Ten more to go." Eben corrects to "Eleven." **(This is good—keep this, it establishes Eben as the accurate one).**
    - **Ch 8**: Noel says "Ten now." (Noel is still ignoring the math or just exhausted).
- **Plan**: Ensure Eben remains the voice of accuracy. Noel can be wrong due to exhaustion, but his errors should feel like fatigue, not a writing oversight. I will adjust Ch 5 to "Eleven more" if it's after midnight, or "Twelve days" if referring to the whole chunk.

### Prop Tracking: The Chartreuse Ribbons
- **Status**: Introduced as a "festive felony" in Ch 1. Mentioned by Eben in Ch 2. 
- **Opportunity**: We need to see where they ended up.
- **Plan**: Add a beat in Ch 6 or Ch 7 where Noel sees the chartreuse being used creatively (maybe as ties for the partridge crates or a "bow" on the replacement snowman) to show his "vision" blending with Eben's "systems."

### Consistency of Names
- **Festival Name**: Currently fluctuates between "Merryweather Festival" and "Twelve Days of Magic."
- **Plan**: Standardize to "Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic" or similar.

## 2. Transition & Ending "Punch-ups"

### Ch 2 → Ch 3 (The "Accuracy" Sting)
- **Current**: Ch 2 ends with Eben pulling off gloves. Ch 3 starts with Noel fuming.
- **Punch-up**: End Ch 2 on the clinical chill of Eben's "Accuracy" comment. Start Ch 3 with the physical sensation of the "cold coffee" matching the coldness of Eben's logic.

### Ch 4 → Ch 5 (From Fire to Echo)
- **Current**: Ch 4 ends with the snowman fire put out. Ch 5 starts in the storage room.
- **Punch-up**: Carry the smell of "burnt vinyl" more heavily into the start of Ch 5. Use the transition to highlight the shift from public "heroics" to private vulnerability.

### Ch 6 → Ch 7 (Matching Strides to Launch)
- **Current**: Ch 6 ends with "Temporary." Ch 7 starts at 8 PM launch.
- **Punch-up**: In Ch 6, establish the *anticipation* of the 8 PM launch. In Ch 7, open with the "click" of the lights—a sensory payoff to the "rhythm" established in Ch 6.

### Ch 7 → Ch 8 (The High and the Low)
- **Current**: Ch 7 ends with "Stays." Ch 8 starts in the quiet hall.
- **Punch-up**: Contrast the "diamond-scattering" lights of Ch 7 with the "harsh fluorescent" lights of Ch 8. Make the silence of the hall feel like a physical weight after the roar of the crowd.

## 3. Series Continuity Check

- **Character Voices**: Noel's voice is consistently warmer/faster; Eben's is clipped/observational.
- **Relationship Progression**: Ep 1 target is "Working Together" and "Temporary Lie Established." Both are clearly hit.
- **The "I'm Fine" Rule**: Noel says it once (Ch 3). Narrator uses it as a motif. This is within the 1x per episode threshold.

## 4. Proposed Timeline for Fixes

1. **Surgical Edits**: Fix the day countdown in Ch 5, 6, and 8.
2. **Prop Integration**: Add the "Chartreuse" payoff to Ch 7.
3. **Transition Polish**: Update the start/ends of the chapters to maximize the "seamless day" feeling.
