# Chapter 1: Cold Open

Noel Merrick had been awake for thirty-seven hours and was handling it fine.

This was a lie, but it was a festive lie, so it was legally tax-deductible.

The Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic was Tinsel Town's holy grail, and right now, the fluorescent lights of the hall buzzed overhead like angry wasps. His coffee had gone cold somewhere around crisis number twelve.

"Noel!" A vendor waved frantically from across the main floor. "The sound system's doing the thing again!"

The thing where it worked perfectly during testing and then developed a death rattle the moment anyone actually needed it.

"On it." The smile clicked into place—a reflex honed by a lifetime of making sure nobody saw the cracks. He crossed the hall in purposeful strides, though his knees felt like they were held together by aging rubber bands and holiday prayers.

Five forty-seven AM. Still dark outside. The festival launched in four hours and thirteen minutes. Noel had approximately ninety-three problems to solve, half of which were currently hidden in the shadows, waiting to pounce.

His hands shook a little as he crouched beside the sound board. He tucked them into his pockets until the tremor subsided. Just the cold. December in Tinsel Town didn't mess around.

"It's making a clicking sound." Marcus—who ran the candle booth and always smelled faintly of unburnt wick—hovered at his shoulder. "Like a... click. Click. Click."

"I've noticed." Noel smiled wider, the professional mask anchored by pure spite.

Loose cable. A simple, manageable failure.

"Try it now." He tightened the connection.

Marcus flipped a switch. Clean sound poured through the speakers.

"You're a miracle worker. I don't know what this town would do without you, Noel."

Noel's chest did something complicated. *What would he be, if he wasn't the one everyone needed?*

"Just doing my job."

He stood, his vision swimming for a second. His phone buzzed three times. The rhythm of impending doom.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Noel! Quick question!*
**Mayor Kringle:** *Did we file the vendor permits for Evergreen Square?*
**Mayor Kringle:** *Because I'm looking at the system and I'm not seeing them and I'm sure it's just a glitch but—*

Noel's stomach dropped.

The permits.

He remembered the kitchen table. The glow of the laptop. He'd been right there, cursor hovering over the 'Submit' button, when Mrs. Henderson had called about the wreath delivery catastrophe. He'd tabbed away, and then—the world had kept spinning.

"Excuse me." Noel nodded to Marcus, the smile still locked in place.

He walked very calmly toward the storage room. He made it three steps past the door before he braced both hands on a stack of boxes and allowed himself exactly five seconds of silent, screaming panic.

One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

He straightened. His reflection in a nearby window looked like a ghost that had been through a car wash.

He dialed the permit office. Voicemail. Of course. It was 5:50 AM. Normal people were still tucked under duvets.

His phone buzzed again.

**Wes Candle:** *Saw your car in the lot. Coffee?*
**Noel:** *Yes. Please. IV drip if possible.*
**Wes:** *On it. Also you look like death. Just FYI.*
**Noel:** *Festive death.*
**Wes:** *The best kind.*

Noel pocketed his phone and returned to the main hall. The chaos had multiplied in his absence. The volunteer coordinator had lost the sign-in sheets. Two vendors were currently engaged in a heated debate over whose booth was more "spiritually aligned" with the entrance. Someone's terrier—Sprinkles—was investigating the buffet with a professional's focus.

And then there was Hugh.

Hugh Everhart swept into the building wearing what appeared to be a cape made entirely of silver tinsel. He looked like an aggressive disco ball.

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice echoed through the rafters. "Crisis averted! The ribbon shipment arrived!"

"That's great, Hugh—"

"It's the wrong color!"

Of course it was.

"How wrong?" Noel shielded his eyes from the tinsel-glare.

"Chartreuse instead of forest green." Hugh held up a spool, his expression tragic. "Do you know what chartreuse does to a holiday palette, Noel? It's a crime. A festive felony."

"We'll fix it."

"You're a saint!" Hugh swept away in a rustle of metallic fringe.

**Mayor Kringle:** *Also! Quick thing! I arranged some help for you!*

Noel stared at the screen. The word 'help' felt like an insult. 'Help' meant he wasn't handling it. 'Help' meant the cracks were showing.

**Noel:** *What kind of help?*
**Mayor Kringle:** *You'll see! Should be there soon! Merry Christmas!*

He caught Sprinkles, returned the dog to a frantic vendor, and was mid-explanation about the spiritual alignment of booth placement when the main doors groaned open.

A draft of freezing winter air sliced through the stale warmth of the hall, carrying the sharp scent of cold pine and impending judgment.

Noel looked up.

The man in the doorway was a stark contrast to the colorful, glitter-stained chaos surrounding him. Tall. Charcoal coat tailored to the millimeter. He held a clipboard like a tactical map.

He scanned the room—the bickering vendors, Hugh's tinsel cape, the dog hair on Noel's trousers—with the clinical detachment of a surgeon about to begin a difficult operation.

Then his eyes landed on Noel.

Noel, who was currently covered in dog hair and running on thirty-seven hours of desperation.

The man didn't smile. He just assessed. Cold. Precise.

Noel hated him instantly.

The stranger walked toward him with a measured, rhythmic gait. He stopped exactly three feet away—the precise boundary of professional distance.

"Can I help you?" Noel's smile was strained but holding.

"I'm here to help you."

His voice was a low, steady baritone. Like ice.

"I'm handling it."

The stranger's gaze flickered to the chaos behind Noel. To the ticking sound system, the missing sheets, the chartreuse ribbons. Then back to Noel's bloodshot eyes.

"That's one word for it."

And Noel knew, with the sinking certainty of a man who'd just hit a very festive iceberg, that this was going to be a very long twelve days.

---

# Chapter 2: First Meeting

Eben Frost did not believe in chaos.

Chaos was just order that hadn't been properly categorized yet.

The Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic, however, was testing that theory with malicious enthusiasm.

Eben stood in the doorway, leather gloves still on, and conducted his assessment. Fourteen vendors in various states of logistical meltdown. Booth placement violated basic traffic flow principles—a bottleneck waiting to happen. Volunteer coordination appeared to be a rumor. Someone had brought a terrier that was eyeing a buffet table. And there was a man in a cape made of silver tinsel who was the loudest thing in the room.

And in the center of it all—

Eben's gaze snagged on him immediately.

The event coordinator. Noel Merrick. The briefing files hadn't specified that the man in charge was currently holding himself together with nothing but caffeine and what looked like pure, unadulterated spite.

Noel was the eye of the storm. Mid-twenties, rumpled, smiling like someone who had learned the expression from a textbook.

It almost worked.

Eben watched him handle three separate crises in ninety seconds. Redirected a vendor. Soothed a mounting argument. Produced tape from thin air to fix a falling banner.

Efficient. Competent. Drowning.

This was a man holding a falling world together by sheer stubborn refusal to let go.

"Mr. Frost!" Mayor Kringle appeared at his elbow, vibrating with anxiety. "You made it! Wonderful! Let me introduce you to—"

"The event coordinator." Eben didn't look up from his clipboard. "Noel Merrick."

"Yes! How did you—"

"Process of elimination. He's the only one directing traffic. Everyone else is just reacting."

Mayor Kringle beamed. "Exactly! Which is why we need you. Noel's wonderful, absolutely wonderful, but he's been doing this alone and—well. You'll see."

Eben had already seen. The question wasn't whether Noel needed help, but whether he would accept it without Eben having to dismantle his pride first.

"Does he know I'm coming?"

Mayor Kringle's smile flickered. "I... mentioned it."

"When?"

"Just now. Via text."

Eben closed his eyes briefly. "So you've sent me in as an ambush."

"He knows there's help! He just doesn't know it's... well, you. Specifically. Yet."

"I'll introduce you!" Mayor Kringle said, and before Eben could suggest a more strategic approach, the mayor was already halfway across the floor.

Eben followed.

Up close, Noel Merrick looked worse. Not bad—objectively, a very handsome man—but worn thin. Like a coat that had been through one too many winters.

"Noel! This is Eben Frost. He's the help I mentioned!"

Noel's smile didn't waver, but Eben saw the steel slam down behind his eyes.

"Help." Noel repeated the word like a defeat.

"Logistics consultant. The mayor hired me to assist with festival operations."

"I'm handling the operations."

"I'm sure you are. The mayor felt a second set of hands might be useful."

"I have hands." Noel held them up. They were shaking. "Two of them. Fully functional."

"They're vibrating."

"Caffeine."

"Exhaustion."

The mayor made a strangled sound. "Well! I'll just let you two get acquainted! Eben, Noel will show you around. Noel, Eben is here for the full twelve days, so—"

"Twelve days." Noel made it sound like a prison sentence.

"Merry Christmas!" Mayor Kringle fled.

Silence stretched between them. Noel's smile finally cracked—not broke, but shifted into something sharper.

"I didn't ask for help."

"I'm aware."

"I don't need help."

"Also aware."

"Then why are you here, Frost?"

Eben decided on the blunt truth. It was more efficient than tact.

"Because the mayor is panicking. Because the festival is understaffed. And because you've been awake for thirty-seven hours and you're currently the single point of failure for this town's holiday season."

"Thirty-seven? How did you—"

"Bags under your eyes. Timestamp on your last file upload."

Noel's mouth tightened. "Accuracy is just one word for being an asshole, Frost."

"In my experience, it's the only word that matters when the alternative is collapse."

Noel stared at him. Eben waited.

"Then be accurate," Noel said finally. "Just don't expect me to like it."

"I don't. I expect you to survive."

Eben began to pull off his gloves. One finger at a time. He watched Noel's eyes track the movement, lingering on his bare skin for a beat too long.

"Where do you want me?"

Noel's expression did something complicated. "Anywhere that's not directly in my way."

"I'll do my best."

He meant it as a promise. But as he looked at the exhaustion lining Noel's face, he realized that staying out of the way was going to be the hardest part of the job.

Because this was temporary. It had to be.

---

# Chapter 3: Competence Clash

Noel was going to kill Mayor Kringle.

Not immediately. He had a festival to run, and the paperwork for a homicide would be a logistical nightmare. But eventually. With something festive. Maybe a sharpened candy cane.

He watched Eben Frost cross the hall toward the vendor area. The man moved with a measured precision that suggested he'd never stumbled on a patch of ice in his entire life.

"He looks like he alphabetizes his cereal," Noel muttered, taking a desperate gulp of cold coffee. "And judges people who don't."

The worst part—the absolutely infuriating part—was that the machine was already working. Eben had known about the permits. He'd known about the sound system. He'd apparently absorbed Noel's sleep-deprived briefing files and turned them into a tactical strategy.

"Noel!" Wes appeared at his elbow, holding a coffee cup the size of a small bucket. "Brought reinforcements."

"You're a saint, Wes." Noel accepted the cup, the heat seeping into his chilled fingers.

"I'm really not." Wes nodded toward the far side of the hall where Eben was speaking to Marcus at the candle booth. "So. That's the help."

"Apparently."

"He looks intense."

"He looks like he's conducting an autopsy on my life choices."

"I was going to say 'sharp,' but sure." Wes leaned against the wall. "How long before you two either kiss or commit a felony?"

Noel choked on his coffee. "What? No. Felony, maybe. The other thing? Absolutely not."

"Uh-huh." Wes's smile was a weapon. "He's been staring at you for ten minutes."

"He's been in the building for ten minutes total, Wes. He's assessing the room."

"He's looking at you like you're a puzzle. Trust me."

Noel refused to look. "You're delusional."

"I'll be at the bakery if you need me. Try not to set anything on fire."

"That was one time!"

"It was three times, and the fire marshal has your picture on a dartboard."

Wes left. Noel stood alone, fuming.

He turned toward the storage room.

And nearly collided with a wall of charcoal wool.

"Jesus! Do you have to haunt the hall like a Victorian ghost?"

"I walked normally." Eben's voice was steady as a glacier. "You were distracted."

"I was paying attention to the ninety-three things on my list."

"None of which are currently on fire."

"Give it twenty minutes. Hugh is here."

Eben's expression didn't change, but his eyes tightened. "The vendor placement issue is resolved."

"You can't just move booths, Frost. People have contracts—"

"They have a bottleneck that violates fire code. I explained the physics. They were both satisfied with the new arrangement once they realized it would double their visibility."

Noel opened his mouth. Closed it. He'd been planning to handle that. He'd had a whole speech prepared.

"You're welcome."

"I didn't thank you."

"I noticed."

Noel's jaw tightened. "The sign-in sheets. Where are they?"

"Second shelf. Left side. Behind the tinsel."

"How did you find them? I looked for twenty minutes."

"I looked logically."

Noel brushed past him into the storage room. He found the sheets exactly where Eben said. He stood in the dim light, the paper crinkling in his hand.

For the first time in years, somebody else was holding the weight.

It should have been a relief.

When he emerged, Eben was already reorganizing the check-in table. Three distinct stations: Badge Distribution, Assignment Cards, Emergency Contact. Beautiful. Surgical. Annoying.

"This is elaborate."

"It's efficient." Eben didn't look up.

"Don't let the power go to your head, Frost. It's just badges."

"Badges represent identity and authorization. They are the metadata of the festival."

"We're a holiday festival in Tinsel Town, not a tech summit."

"Everything is a system. Regardless of how much glitter you apply."

"NOEL!" Hugh's voice boomed across the room. "We have a glitter emergency!"

"Is anyone bleeding, Hugh?"

"Not physically! But my artistic integrity is hemorrhaging!"

"I'll handle the glitter." Eben stepped away from the table.

"You? You hate glitter."

"I recognize its properties as a messy, invasive substance. Which is why I will manage it with a containment strategy while you finish the volunteer briefing."

Noel wanted to argue. But Eben was already moving toward Hugh with a determined, clinical air.

"Fine. But if you get a single speck on that coat, don't blame me."

"I won't."

Noel watched him go. Eben Frost was cold, arrogant, and had the social warmth of a frozen pond. But as Noel looked at the organized check-in table, he felt a strange sensation in his chest.

He wasn't drowning anymore.

He was just floating. And he wasn't sure if he liked the view.

# Chapter 4: Town Watches

By noon, the focus of the Merryweather Twelve Days of Magic had shifted from the tinsel-covered rafters of Merryweather Hall to the icy expanse of Evergreen Square.

Noel stood at the edge of the fountain and tried to remember why he'd thought a twelve-day celebration of human endurance and holiday clichés was a good idea.

The square was a masterpiece of organized disaster. Wooden booths spiraled out from the center. Strings of lights lay in tangled heaps. And in the very middle, a massive Colorado Spruce stood tall, its branches currently bare and appearing resentful of the proximity to so much glitter.

"It'll come together," Noel whispered to the frost on his breath.

"Magic is an unreliable variable in a project timeline."

Noel didn't even jump this time. "You're going to have to stop doing that, Eben. People will start thinking the square is haunted by a well-dressed spirit of Christmas judgment."

"I walk normally." Eben scanned the hot cocoa station placement. "You don't have a coat on."

"I have a sweater. It's festive."

"It's wool. Not windproof. You're shivering."

"I'm handling it."

Wes appeared with a tray of cinnamon-dusted pastries and steaming cups. "Reinforcements! I brought sustenance for the survivors."

Wes turned to Eben. "Wes Candle. I run the bakery. I also know everyone's secrets, but I only trade them for quality spreadsheets."

"Eben Frost. Logistics."

"The man Mayor Kringle hired to save Noel from himself. How's the rescue mission going?"

Noel felt the familiar prickle. "I don't need saving, Wes. I need the inflatable snowman to stop leaking air."

"I've already patched the snowman." Eben sipped his coffee. "I'm here to ensure the systems remain functional for the contract duration."

"Contract." Wes caught Noel's eye. "So. Temporary."

"Twelve days." Eben added. "Then Chicago. Clean entry, clean exit."

Wes laughed. "Good luck with the 'clean exit' part. Tinsel Town tends to be sticky."

"Sticky is just a lack of proper cleaning protocols."

Wes turned to go. "Try not to set anything on fire, Noel!"

"It was three times, Wes!"

They stood in silence as Wes disappeared into the crowd.

"The town *is* watching." Eben looked around the square.

Noel could see them—vendors, volunteers, families setting up shop. All watching the man who had been their anchor for five years. And watching the stranger beside him.

"They're watching because they want to know if they're safe," Eben said. "People in a community like this rely on their leaders for stability."

"You think I'm a leader? I thought you think I'm a failure of resource management."

"A leader who is currently failing at resource management is still a leader. It just means the leader needs a better support system."

"And that's you?"

"I'm the logistics. The system is the system." Eben adjusted his clipboard. "I'll handle the tree lighting crew. You go deal with the Mayor. He's explaining the 'spirit of Christmas' to a confused electrician."

"NOEL!" Mayor Kringle waved from across the square. "The power grid—it's not festive! It's making a humming noise!"

"On it."

The next three hours were a blur of escalating festive panic. The inflatable snowman started listing left with a slow, mournful hiss. A vendor brought three dozen live partridges because they'd "misinterpreted the theme."

And then there was the glitter.

Hugh arrived with a literal cannon. "It's a sparkle surge, Noel! To bless the square!"

"Hugh, don't—"

*FOOMP.*

A cloud of silver glitter erupted into the freezing air, coating everything within fifty feet. Beautiful for exactly three seconds. Then the wind picked up.

Noel found himself standing in a blizzard of sparkle. He felt Eben beside him, and for a wild moment, his hand brushed Eben's sleeve. The fabric was cold, but the arm underneath was solid.

"Basic resource allocation." Eben muttered it under his breath, but he didn't move away.

"We're sparkly, Frost." Noel laughed. "Competently sparkly."

"I am not sparkly. I am merely reflecting light."

And then, it happened.

A small popping sound from the inflatable snowman. A larger pop.

"Is that... smoke?"

Noel's eyes widened. "THE SNOWMAN IS ON FIRE!"

"NOBODY PANIC!" Hugh screamed, which was the universal signal for everyone to lose their minds.

The snowman began to melt in a spectacular, flaming puddle. The sharp, acrid scent of burnt vinyl choked the air—a smell that would haunt the square for a month.

Noel ran toward the fire extinguisher, but a gloved hand caught his arm.

"I have it."

Eben didn't run. He walked with purpose. Reached the extinguisher, pulled the pin, and neutralized the flaming Frosty with clinical efficiency.

Noel stood there, heart hammering, watching Eben return the extinguisher to its stand.

The town was watching. And they weren't looking at Noel. They were looking at the man who had just saved the square.

"Clean execution." Eben returned to Noel's side. "The snowman was defective. I'll file the insurance claim."

Noel looked at the melted puddle and then at the faces of his neighbors.

"Thanks."

"Now, we have eleven more hours until the opening. We should probably move the partridges."

Noel followed him, the weight of "temporary" feeling heavier with every step.

---

# Chapter 5: First Crack

The inflatable snowman incident had been resolved with minimal property damage and maximum emotional fallout.

Eben stood in the dim, cool air of the storage room behind Merryweather Hall. The scent of burnt vinyl still hung in his nostrils.

He'd been hired for logistics. He had not been hired for flaming holiday décor, partridge containment, or managing an event director who treated every failure like a personal indictment.

And yet.

Eben pulled off his leather gloves. One finger at a time. A familiar ritual that marked the boundary between performance and existence.

The festival was chaos. Noel Merrick was chaos in human form—a man made of caffeine and a desperate need to be the one who fixed everything.

Eben should hate this. He should be counting down to his flight.

He was remembering the way Noel's hand had felt against his sleeve in the middle of the glitter-storm.

This was a problem.

Better to stay on the edges. Better to be the temporary solution than the permanent loss.

Better to keep his gloves on.

He looked at his bare hands. Flexed his fingers against the cold.

The door creaked open.

Eben didn't look up immediately. He knew that stride. Frantic but trying to be light.

Noel stood in the doorway, backlit by fluorescent hum. The mask had slipped, leaving something raw and tired. He looked like a man who had finally realized the world wouldn't end if he stopped smiling.

"Sorry. I didn't know anyone was in here. I just needed—" He gestured toward the shelving.

"Extension cords."

Noel's laugh was startled. Genuine. "The snowman incident. That's what we're calling it?"

"More professional than 'The Great Vinyl Meltdown.'"

"Adds a layer of dignity to the failure." Noel stepped into the room. His eyes caught on Eben's hands.

Eben should put the gloves back on.

He didn't.

"Long day."

"Eleven more to go." Noel leaned against a stack of boxes, his shoulders finally dropping.

"Twelve isn't so many."

"You really believe that?"

"It's a finite period. Beginning, middle, end. Manageable."

"And after the end?"

"Fewer with two people."

Noel's expression shifted. Something soft and dangerously close to trust. "Fewer with two."

Silence. Thick. Charged.

Eben was aware of the three feet between them. The coffee stain on Noel's collar. The speck of silver glitter caught in his dark hair.

"You're good at this."

"At what?"

"At fixing things. At being the stabilizer." Noel looked at his own hands. "You came in here and in six hours, you made everything work. You handled the fire. You handled me."

"I didn't handle you, Noel."

"You made it so I didn't have to do it all alone. I'm not used to that."

"I noticed."

"Is it that obvious?"

"You treat every crisis like a personal failure. It's inefficient."

Noel laughed, short and sharp. "I'm lovable when I'm useful, Eben. If I'm not the one fixing the snowman, what am I?"

Eben looked at him. The vulnerability. The breach of protocol.

"You're the person this town loves regardless of the snowman."

"How do you know that? You've been here for six hours."

"The pattern is that everyone looks to you not just for the schedule, but for the permission to be happy. That has nothing to do with whether the lights work."

Noel was quiet for a long beat.

"That's a lot of pressure."

"It is. Which is why you need help."

"Temporary help."

The word landed between them.

"Temporary."

Noel's expression flickered. "Eleven days. Then Chicago."

"That's the job."

Noel pushed off the boxes, his mask clicking back into place. "I should get those cords."

"Noel—"

"Thanks. For the analysis." He paused in the doorway. "You're not what I expected, Frost."

"Cold and distant?"

"Contained. There's a difference." His gaze dropped to Eben's hands. "You should put your gloves back on. It's freezing in here."

He left.

Eben stood alone. He looked at his bare hands—vulnerable, human.

Slowly, he pulled his gloves back on. One finger at a time.

It didn't help.

Eleven days. He just had to survive eleven days of wanting to stay in a place he had no business belonging to.

# Chapter 6: Working Together

**NOEL**

They'd developed a rhythm.

It was the way Eben would already be holding the ladder before Noel realized he needed to reach the top strand of lights. The way Noel would finish explaining something to a vendor, and Eben would be standing there with the exact form that needed signing.

Efficient. Seamless. Destabilizing.

"Left side needs more slack." Eben called from across the square. The 8 PM launch was only four hours away.

Noel adjusted the light strand. "Better?"

"Perfect."

*Perfect.* The word hit like a weight. If Eben was the precision, what was Noel? Just the glitter?

"Noel!" A volunteer waved from the edge of the square. "Where do you want the cocoa station?"

Noel opened his mouth.

"Northeast corner." Eben appeared beside him. "Best proximity to the seating area. Puts the heaters at the windward side."

"What he said."

The volunteer left, looking more confident.

"You have opinions about cocoa station thermodynamics."

"I have opinions about the conservation of energy."

"I'm starting to think you enjoy Being Right."

Eben's mouth twitched. "Being right is just a byproduct of good data."

"I'd appreciate it if you were occasionally wrong. For my ego."

"I'll take it under advisement."

They stood side by side, watching the square transform. The tree was a pillar of unlit potential. The booths were orderly.

"We did this."

"You did the vision." Eben didn't look away from the tree. "I handled the physics."

"We did it together, Eben. Don't audit the credit."

Eben was quiet. Then: "Together."

Something warm unfurled in Noel's chest.

"I should check the sound board."

"I checked it twenty minutes ago."

"I should check it anyway."

"Why?"

*Because I need to not be standing three inches away from you. Because you smell like winter and cedar.*

"Professional thoroughness."

Eben didn't believe the lie. But he didn't challenge it.

Noel fled toward the stage.

---

**EBEN**

Noel was avoiding him.

It was strategic. A sudden need to audit things that didn't need auditing. A careful preservation of distance.

Eben was doing the same thing.

He found himself anticipating Noel's needs with precision that felt like vulnerability. He knew when Noel was about to trip. He knew when his caffeine had worn off.

"Mr. Frost?" A volunteer approached. "We're not sure about the banner placement."

"Shift it three feet left and raise it eighteen inches. Visible from the highway without catching crosswinds."

"That makes sense!"

Eben wasn't thinking about the banner. He was watching Noel across the square, laughing with Wes, head tilted back in the dying sunlight.

"Eben!"

Noel jogged toward him. "We have a problem."

"What kind?"

"The mayor wants a photo op. With 'The Team.' For the town website."

"No."

"I told him no! He's got the photographer already."

"I don't do public relations."

"Look at him." Noel pointed toward the center of the square, where Mayor Kringle was bouncing on his feet. "He's so excited he might actually pop."

Eben looked at Noel. The exhaustion lining his face.

"One photo."

"Really?"

"One. Then I retreat into the shadows."

"Deal."

They walked toward the mayor. Side by side. Eben found himself matching Noel's stride without thinking.

"Just stand together!" Mayor Kringle beamed. "Look competent! Festive!"

"We're Being Right." Noel muttered it just for Eben.

The photographer snapped the picture.

"Wonderful! You look like you've been working together for years!"

Nine hours. But it felt like a system that had always been in place.

They escaped the mayor's enthusiasm.

"Eleven now." Noel didn't move away. "Eleven more days."

"Temporary."

"Temporary."

The word was a lie they were both using to protect themselves.

And as Eben stood in the falling snow, he knew he was in significant logistical trouble.

Because for the first time in ten years, he didn't want a clean exit.

---

# Chapter 7: Evening Save

The lights came on at exactly eight PM.

Noel stood at the edge of Evergreen Square and watched the transformation. One moment, construction zone. The next, magic.

Thousands of tiny white lights blazed to life with a single, synchronized *click*. The lights reflected off the fresh snow like scattered diamonds. The tree glowed like a beacon. Even the replacement snowman—which Eben had personally vetted—looked noble in the golden glow, its top hat secured by a thick bow of chartreuse ribbon.

The chartreuse was hideous. A crime against holiday tradition. But in the glow of the square, it looked like a victory lap.

The crowd gasped. Then applauded.

Noel's chest did something complicated. *One down. Eleven to go.*

"It's beautiful." Mrs. Henderson squeezed his arm. "I don't know where we'd be without you, Noel."

"Just doing my job."

The thought should have been enough. Tonight, it felt like a cage.

"Noel."

Eben was standing three feet away, charcoal coat stark against the festive backdrop. "We have a problem."

"What kind?"

"The sound system. Main amplifier is cutting out."

"I thought you checked it twice."

"I did. It was stable twenty minutes ago." Eben looked at the crowd, then back at Noel. "I can bypass the circuit, but I can't hold the board steady and reach the wiring at the same time."

"You're asking me for help?"

"I need someone I trust."

Noel froze. Eben had known him for less than fifteen hours, and he was using that word as if it meant everything.

"Show me."

They moved through the crowd together. Eben led him behind the stage to the cramped sound booth.

"The connection is loose. I need you to hold the board while I re-seat the terminals."

"That's it?"

"I need someone I trust."

Noel braced his shoulder against the heavy board. They were close. Close enough to feel the heat radiating from Eben's body. Close enough to smell the cedar and cold-pine.

Eben's hands moved with focused efficiency. No gloves. His fingers were long and sure.

"Almost there."

"Done."

Eben didn't move away immediately. They stayed there for a beat too long.

"Test it."

Noel flipped the switch. Clean sound poured through the speakers.

"Perfect."

"Perfect."

They both stepped back. Eben reached for his gloves. Armor back in place.

"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO DAY ONE OF THE MERRYWEATHER TWELVE DAYS OF MAGIC!"

Mayor Kringle's voice boomed across the square. The crowd roared.

Noel and Eben moved to the edge of the stage. Side by side. Not touching.

"You did it."

"We did it."

"A functional partnership."

Noel looked at Eben. The man who treated attachment like a system error but who had just said *I trust you* in a dark sound booth.

*I don't want this to be temporary.*

"Long day." Eben kept his gaze on the lights.

"Ten more to go."

"Eleven."

"Right. One down." Noel laughed. "Eleven more days of Being Right."

"And then?"

"Then you leave. And I go back to handling it."

Eben just watched the snow fall. "Yes. That's the system."

But as the lights reflected in Eben's dark eyes, Noel knew the system was already failing.

Because for the first time in his life, Noel Merrick didn't want to be 'fine.'

He wanted to be *stays*.

# Chapter 8: Hook Ending

The hall was quiet.

Eben stood in the center of Merryweather Hall and listened to the silence. It was cold and hollow, missing the frantic energy of the day.

Just the two of them.

Across the room, Noel was hunched over the volunteer schedule for tomorrow. The harsh fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, washing out the warmth in his face—a stark contrast to the diamond-glow of the square six hours ago.

Eben should leave. His contract for Day One was complete. Systems were stable. Equipment secured.

He didn't move.

"I think that's everything." Noel looked up, his voice stripped of its performer's charm.

"The permits are finalized. Volunteer schedule optimized. Emergency protocols in place."

"So we're done."

"For today."

Silence. Heavier than before.

Noel set down his clipboard with a clatter. He crossed the floor, stopping at the three-foot boundary.

The distance felt like a failure of geometry.

"Tomorrow."

"Tomorrow."

"Same time?"

"I'll be here."

Noel blinked. "You don't have to be. I've done the morning setup for years."

"I don't do things out of obligation, Noel. I do them because they are necessary for the project."

"And I'm part of the project?"

"You are the center of it."

Noel looked at him, his gaze heavy and searching. "That sounds like you care about the person, Frost. Not just the data."

The warning system tightened in Eben's chest.

"I care about the outcome."

"Right. The outcome." Noel laughed quietly. "Eleven more days of outcomes. Then you leave."

"That is the arrangement."

"Back to the clean exits. Back to the apartment that isn't a home."

"It's efficient."

"Efficiency isn't the same as living, Eben."

"Then analyze why you're still standing here instead of going to your hotel."

Eben didn't have an answer that fit into a spreadsheet. He was standing here because leaving Noel alone in this hollow hall felt like a logistical catastrophe.

"This is temporary."

Noel flinched. "I know. Just for the festival."

"Eleven now."

"Then you leave, and I go back to being the one this town needs. Alone."

"You have the town. You have Wes. Hugh."

"I have a lot of people who need me, Eben. That's not the same as having someone who stays."

The honesty breached every boundary Eben had built. He wanted to close the distance. He wanted to say *I'll stay*.

He didn't.

Because everything ended. Every project closed.

"I should go."

"Six AM. Don't be late."

"I'm never late, Frost. I'm just spiritually delayed."

Noel smiled then—soft, tired, devastating.

Eben walked out without looking back.

The winter air hit him like a blow. He sat in his car and stared at the dark windshield. Looked at his leather gloves—the armor he'd put back on the moment they left the sound booth.

"Temporary."

The word didn't mean anything anymore.

Because Noel Merrick had walked through his defenses with a smile and a glitter emergency. And Eben, the man of clean exits, was already realizing that the hardest part of the twelve days wasn't going to be the work.

It was going to be the leaving.

Eleven more days.

Too much time. Not nearly enough.

And as the snow covered Tinsel Town, Eben finally admitted the truth.

He wasn't here to save the festival.

He was here to find a reason to stay.
