## BLURB

This town adopted him when he wasn't looking.

Noel Merrick has always been the one taking care of Tinsel Town. Now, somehow, Tinsel Town is taking care of him back—and it's all because of Eben.

The festival is running smoothly for the first time in years. The volunteers have stopped panicking. Even Hugh has graduated from "glitter emergencies" to "manageable sparkle situations."

And everyone—literally everyone—has opinions about Noel's love life.

Eben didn't sign up for a small-town welcoming committee. He definitely didn't sign up for Wes's knowing smiles, the mayor's enthusiastic matchmaking, or the way the entire town seems to have decided he belongs here.

But when a festival crisis brings everyone together—and Noel looks at him like he's part of something bigger than a contract—Eben realizes he might have found something he didn't know he was looking for.

Family.

**Day six of twelve. Home isn't always where you start.**

*Frost & Noel is a 12-episode cozy MM romance series featuring found family, small-town belonging, grumpy-sunshine dynamics, explicit heat, and a guaranteed HEA.*
