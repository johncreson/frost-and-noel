# **Chapter 1**

The reception was elegant in the way that sponsor events always were: too many lights, too much food that no one ate, and too many people pretending to have a good time.

Noel was excellent at pretending to have a good time.

Eben, standing beside him in a dark suit that should be illegal, was less excellent but managing.

"Smile," Noel murmured.

"I am smiling."

"You look like you're planning a murder."

"I'm planning several."

Noel bit back a laugh. "We just need to get through the photos. Then we can leave."

Miranda appeared with a professional photographer in tow. "Perfect timing. We'd love to get some shots of you two for our campaign."

"Of course," Noel said automatically.

The photographer positioned them near the decorated fireplace. Adjusted the lighting. Made them stand closer.

"This is good," the photographer said. "Now, I want you to look like you're in love."

Noel's brain short-circuited.

Eben's hand tightened on his waist.

"Just... be natural," the photographer said. "Forget the camera. Just look at each other."

They turned. Their eyes met.

Noel forgot how to breathe.

Eben's expression was—soft. Open. The way he'd looked the night they'd slept together. The way he'd looked when he'd said "I want to."

The camera clicked. And clicked again.

"Perfect," the photographer murmured. "That's beautiful. Stay just like that."

Eben's thumb brushed against Noel's hip. A small movement. Probably unconscious.

Noel leaned in without thinking.

The camera kept clicking.

"Wonderful!" The photographer stepped back. "I think we got it. You two are very photogenic together."

Eben's hand dropped. The loss was immediate.

Miranda reviewed the photos, beaming. "These are perfect. Exactly the kind of authentic connection our brand wants to showcase."

Authentic. Right.

They slipped out of the reception hall into a small courtyard. Cold air hit Noel's face. The muffled sound of the party faded behind them.

Eben turned to face him.

"Those photos—" Noel started.

"I know," Eben said quietly.

"We look—"

"I know."

The silence stretched.

Noel opened his mouth to say something. Anything. To ask what this was. Where they stood. What happened next.

Eben's jaw tightened. "Not here."

"Eben—"

"Tomorrow." His voice was strained. "We'll talk tomorrow."

It wasn't an answer. It wasn't even a promise.

But it was all Eben could give, and Noel could see that.

"Okay," he said quietly. "Tomorrow."

Eben nodded once. Then walked back into the reception without looking back.

Noel stood in the cold courtyard, alone, and thought: *He's terrified.*

That was something. It meant Eben felt this too.

It just didn't tell Noel what to do about it.

# **Chapter 2**

Miranda posted them before Noel had finished rinsing the dust off his hands.

He didn't even notice at first. He was halfway through peeling off borrowed gloves when his phone buzzed twice in quick succession, the vibration sharp against his palm.

A tag.

Then another.

He frowned and thumbed the screen awake.

The photo filled the display.

Him and Eben, side by side, laughing. Noel's head tipped just enough toward Eben that it looked intimate. Eben's hand rested at the small of Noel's back, casual, proprietary, like it had always belonged there.

The caption read:

**Tinsel Town knows a power couple when it sees one.**

The comments were already pouring in.

*Finally!*
*Called it from Day One.*
*They look real.*
*Look at the way he's touching him.*

Noel swallowed.

He looked up instinctively.

Eben was twenty feet away, crouched near the trailer, coaxing a stubborn generator back to life. He hadn't seen the post yet. He was focused, jaw tight, hands steady. The version of Eben who fixed things. The version who didn't look at Noel like that photo suggested.

Noel hesitated.

Then Eben's phone buzzed.

He watched the moment land.

Eben stilled. Just for a beat. Long enough that Noel knew he'd seen it.

Eben didn't look at him.

He stood, brushed dirt from his gloves, and turned back to the generator like nothing had happened.

The air shifted.

When Eben finally spoke, his voice was clipped, professional.

"We'll need to reroute the sound for the hayride."

Noel nodded. "Yeah. Sure."

Eben didn't meet his eyes.

Noel stared down at the phone again.

*They look real.*

The town thought it was settled.

Apparently, Eben did not.

# **Chapter 3**

The volunteer shoved the microphone into Noel's hand like it was a live animal.

"Just a quick thank-you for the sponsors," she said. "You two can do it together. Couples always get the best reactions."

Noel froze.

Eben was already there, close enough that their shoulders brushed. Too close to refuse without it looking like something.

Eben leaned in, low. "We don't have to."

But the crowd was already watching.

Noel lifted the mic.

"Hey, everyone," he said, smiling automatically. "Thanks for coming out today."

Applause rippled.

Eben stepped closer, his hand settling at Noel's back again. Warm. Steady. Familiar enough that Noel forgot, just for a second, that this wasn't real.

Someone yelled, "Kiss him!"

Laughter.

Eben's fingers flexed.

Noel felt it. The hesitation. The want. The fear braided together so tight it made his chest ache.

Eben leaned in, just enough to murmur, "Not here."

Noel nodded. Kept smiling. Kept performing.

They finished the thank-you. The applause faded. The volunteer beamed and vanished.

The moment they were out of sight, Eben's hand dropped.

The absence was loud.

Noel watched him take a step back, reestablishing space like it was a boundary line drawn in chalk.

For the first time all day, Noel didn't chase it.

# **Chapter 4**

The goats escaped four times. This was considered a moderate success for a farm charity event.

Noel stood at the edge of the Patterson Family Farm, watching a goat named Sprinkles make her third bid for freedom while a volunteer chased her with a bucket of feed.

"I was promised a petting zoo," Noel said. "Not a prison break."

Eben appeared at his elbow, clipboard in hand. "The fencing is inadequate. I've made a note."

"Of course you have."

They'd been at the farm since dawn, setting up for the annual charity event. Donation stations. Activity areas. A small stage for the kids' holiday performance. And, of course, the petting zoo, which was currently attempting to stage a coup.

After the mic incident, they'd settled into something easier. Not resolved—never resolved—but functional. Working together the way they always had, with an undercurrent of something neither of them was naming.

"Sprinkles is heading for the parking lot," Eben observed.

"On it."

Noel jogged across the field, intercepting the goat before she could make it past the hay bales. She looked at him with eyes that suggested she was planning her next escape.

"You're not as cute as you think you are," Noel told her.

Sprinkles bleated.

"Okay, you're exactly as cute as you think you are. Get back in the pen."

He shepherded her toward the enclosure, where the other goats were watching with what looked like solidarity.

"Noel!" Hugh appeared, covered in hay. "The hayride is ready, the kids are arriving in twenty, and I'm pretty sure one of the chickens is loose."

"Which chicken?"

"The mean one."

"There's always a mean chicken."

Noel looked at the chaos around him. Volunteers running. Animals escaping. Children's laughter drifting from the parking lot where families were arriving.

It was a disaster. A beautiful, festive disaster.

He caught Eben's eye across the field. Eben was directing a volunteer toward the loose chicken, expression serious, completely in his element despite the absurdity of the situation.

The photos were still out there. The town was still talking. And Eben was still here, working beside him, not running.

Noel didn't know what that meant.

But he knew he wanted to find out.

# **Chapter 5**

The goats escaped a fifth time, and this time it was entirely Noel's fault.

"I didn't know the latch was broken," Noel said, watching Sprinkles and her three accomplices bolt toward the donation station.

"The latch was clearly compromised," Eben said, already moving.

"In my defense, I was distracted."

"By what?"

By you, Noel thought. By the way you look in that ridiculous flannel. By the fact that you're here, at a farm, chasing goats, and somehow making it look competent and hot at the same time.

"General chaos," Noel said instead.

They chased the goats together. Noel went left, Eben went right, and somehow they managed to corner all four against the hay bale fortress someone had built for the kids.

"Stay," Noel told the goats.

They did not stay.

Sprinkles made another break for it, and Noel dove.

He caught the goat. He also landed face-first in hay.

There was a moment of silence. Then Eben laughed.

Actually laughed. Not the controlled, careful sound Noel had heard before. A real laugh, surprised out of him, warm and genuine.

Noel looked up, hay in his hair, goat in his arms, and felt his heart do something complicated.

"You look ridiculous," Eben said.

"I caught the goat."

"You're covered in hay."

"Still caught the goat."

Eben walked over. Extended a hand. Pulled Noel to his feet while Noel kept a death grip on Sprinkles.

"Good work," Eben said quietly.

That word again. *Good.* It shouldn't have affected him the way it did.

"Thanks," Noel managed.

They were standing too close. Eben's hand was still on his arm. The goat was squirming between them.

"We should get her back to the pen," Eben said.

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

Then Sprinkles bleated directly into Noel's ear, and the moment broke.

They walked the goats back to the enclosure. Fixed the latch. Made sure the escape artist committee was secured.

"You're good at this," Eben said as they walked back toward the main event area.

"Goat wrangling?"

"Working with people. Animals. Chaos." Eben glanced at him. "You make it look easy."

"It's not easy."

"I know. That's why it's impressive."

Noel's chest felt tight. "You're not bad at it yourself."

"I'm adequate."

"You literally organized a goat interception pattern on the fly."

"Standard logistics."

"You're ridiculous."

"I'm efficient."

They grinned at each other, covered in hay and probably smelling like barnyard, and Noel thought: *This feels like something I could get used to.*

He didn't say it. Not yet. But the thought was there, taking root, dangerous and hopeful.

The photos were out there. The town was watching. Neither of them knew what came next.

But right now, standing in a field with hay in his hair and Eben's laugh still warming something in his chest, Noel didn't care.

This—whatever this was—felt worth the risk.
