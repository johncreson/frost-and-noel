## Chapter 3: The Mic

The volunteer shoved the microphone into Noel's hand like it was a live animal.

"Just a quick thank-you for the sponsors," she said. "You two can do it together. Couples always get the best reactions."

Noel froze.

Eben was already there, close enough that their shoulders brushed. Too close to refuse without it looking like something.

Eben leaned in, low. "We don't have to."

But the crowd was already watching.

Noel lifted the mic.

"Hey, everyone," he said, smiling automatically. "Thanks for coming out today."

Applause rippled.

Eben stepped closer, his hand settling at Noel's back again. Warm. Steady. Familiar enough that Noel forgot, just for a second, that this wasn't real.

Someone yelled, "Kiss him!"

Laughter.

Eben's fingers flexed.

Noel felt it. The hesitation. The want. The fear braided together so tight it made his chest ache.

Eben leaned in, just enough to murmur, "Not here."

Noel nodded. Kept smiling. Kept performing.

They finished the thank-you. The applause faded. The volunteer beamed and vanished.

The moment they were out of sight, Eben's hand dropped.

The absence was loud.

Noel watched him take a step back, reestablishing space like it was a boundary line drawn in chalk.

For the first time all day, Noel didn't chase it.
