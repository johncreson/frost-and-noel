## Chapter 4: Farm Arrival

The goats escaped four times. This was considered a moderate success for a farm charity event.

Noel stood at the edge of the Patterson Family Farm, watching a goat named Glitter make her third bid for freedom while a volunteer chased her with a bucket of feed.

"I was promised a petting zoo," Noel said. "Not a prison break."

Eben appeared at his elbow, clipboard in hand. "The fencing is inadequate. I've made a note."

"Of course you have."

They'd been at the farm since dawn, setting up for the annual charity event. Donation stations. Activity areas. A small stage for the kids' holiday performance. And, of course, the petting zoo, which was currently attempting to stage a coup.

After the mic incident, they'd settled into something easier. Not resolved—never resolved—but functional. Working together the way they always had, with an undercurrent of something neither of them was naming.

"Glitter is heading for the parking lot," Eben observed.

"On it."

Noel jogged across the field, intercepting the goat before she could make it past the hay bales. She looked at him with eyes that suggested she was planning her next escape.

"You're not as cute as you think you are," Noel told her.

Glitter bleated.

"Okay, you're exactly as cute as you think you are. Get back in the pen."

He shepherded her toward the enclosure, where the other goats were watching with what looked like solidarity.

Glitter tried to slip past him at the gate. She failed, but barely.

"You're like actual glitter," Noel muttered. "You get everywhere."

"Noel!" Hugh appeared, covered in hay. "The hayride is ready, the kids are arriving in twenty, and I'm pretty sure one of the chickens is loose."

"Which chicken?"

"The mean one."

"There's always a mean chicken."

Noel looked at the chaos around him. Volunteers running. Animals escaping. Children's laughter drifting from the parking lot where families were arriving.

It was a disaster. A beautiful, festive disaster.

He caught Eben's eye across the field. Eben was directing a volunteer toward the loose chicken, expression serious, completely in his element despite the absurdity of the situation.

The photos were still out there. The town was still talking. And Eben was still here, working beside him, not running.

Noel didn't know what that meant.

But he knew he wanted to find out.
