## Chapter 1: The Sponsor Photos

The reception was elegant in the way that sponsor events always were: too many lights, too much food that no one ate, and too many people pretending to have a good time.

Noel was excellent at pretending to have a good time.

Eben, standing beside him in a dark suit that should be illegal, was less excellent but managing.

"Smile," Noel murmured.

"I am smiling."

"You look like you're planning a murder."

"I'm planning several."

Noel bit back a laugh. "We just need to get through the photos. Then we can leave."

Miranda appeared with a professional photographer in tow. "Perfect timing. We'd love to get some shots of you two for our campaign."

"Of course," Noel said automatically.

The photographer positioned them near the decorated fireplace. Adjusted the lighting. Made them stand closer.

"This is good," the photographer said. "Now, I want you to look like you're in love."

Noel's brain short-circuited.

Eben's hand tightened on his waist.

"Just... be natural," the photographer said. "Forget the camera. Just look at each other."

They turned. Their eyes met.

Noel forgot how to breathe.

Eben's expression was—soft. Open. The way he'd looked the night they'd slept together. The way he'd looked when he'd said "I want to."

The camera clicked. And clicked again.

"Perfect," the photographer murmured. "That's beautiful. Stay just like that."

Eben's thumb brushed against Noel's hip. A small movement. Probably unconscious.

Noel leaned in without thinking.

The camera kept clicking.

"Wonderful!" The photographer stepped back. "I think we got it. You two are very photogenic together."

Eben's hand dropped. The loss was immediate.

Miranda reviewed the photos, beaming. "These are perfect. Exactly the kind of authentic connection our brand wants to showcase."

Authentic. Right.

They slipped out of the reception hall into a small courtyard. Cold air hit Noel's face. The muffled sound of the party faded behind them.

Eben turned to face him.

"Those photos—" Noel started.

"I know," Eben said quietly.

"We look—"

"I know."

The silence stretched.

Noel opened his mouth to say something. Anything. To ask what this was. Where they stood. What happened next.

Eben's jaw tightened. "Not here."

"Eben—"

"Tomorrow." His voice was strained. "We'll talk tomorrow."

It wasn't an answer. It wasn't even a promise.

But it was all Eben could give, and Noel could see that.

"Okay," he said quietly. "Tomorrow."

Eben nodded once. Then walked back into the reception without looking back.

Noel stood in the cold courtyard, alone, and thought: *He's terrified.*

That was something. It meant Eben felt this too.

It just didn't tell Noel what to do about it.
