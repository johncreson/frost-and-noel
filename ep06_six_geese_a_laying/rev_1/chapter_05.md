## Chapter 5: Goat Incident

The goats escaped a fifth time, and this time it was entirely Noel's fault.

"I didn't know the latch was broken," Noel said, watching Glitter and her three accomplices bolt toward the donation station.

"The latch was clearly compromised," Eben said, already moving.

"In my defense, I was distracted."

"By what?"

By you, Noel thought. By the way you look in that ridiculous flannel. By the fact that you're here, at a farm, chasing goats, and somehow making it look competent and hot at the same time.

"General chaos," Noel said instead.

They chased the goats together. Noel went left, Eben went right, and somehow they managed to corner all four against the hay bale fortress someone had built for the kids.

"Stay," Noel told the goats.

They did not stay.

Glitter made another break for it, and Noel dove.

He caught the goat. He also landed face-first in hay.

There was a moment of silence. Then Eben laughed.

Actually laughed. Not the controlled, careful sound Noel had heard before. A real laugh, surprised out of him, warm and genuine.

Noel looked up, hay in his hair, goat in his arms, and felt his heart do something complicated.

"You look ridiculous," Eben said.

"I caught the goat."

"You're covered in hay."

"Still caught the goat."

Eben walked over. Extended a hand. Pulled Noel to his feet while Noel kept a death grip on Glitter.

"Good work," Eben said quietly.

That word again. *Good.* It shouldn't have affected him the way it did.

"Thanks," Noel managed.

They were standing too close. Eben's hand was still on his arm. The goat was squirming between them.

"We should get her back to the pen," Eben said.

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

Then Glitter bleated directly into Noel's ear, and the moment broke.

They walked the goats back to the enclosure. Fixed the latch. Made sure the escape artist committee was secured.

"You're good at this," Eben said as they walked back toward the main event area.

"Goat wrangling?"

"Working with people. Animals. Chaos." Eben glanced at him. "You make it look easy."

"It's not easy."

"I know. That's why it's impressive."

Noel's chest felt tight. "You're not bad at it yourself."

"I'm adequate."

"You literally organized a goat interception pattern on the fly."

"Standard logistics."

"You're ridiculous."

"I'm efficient."

They grinned at each other, covered in hay and probably smelling like barnyard, and Noel thought: *This feels like something I could get used to.*

He didn't say it. Not yet. But the thought was there, taking root, dangerous and hopeful.

The photos were out there. The town was watching. Neither of them knew what came next.

But right now, standing in a field with hay in his hair and Eben's laugh still warming something in his chest, Noel didn't care.

This—whatever this was—felt worth the risk.
