## Chapter 2: The Photos

Miranda posted them before Noel had finished rinsing the dust off his hands.

He didn't even notice at first. He was halfway through peeling off borrowed gloves when his phone buzzed twice in quick succession, the vibration sharp against his palm.

A tag.

Then another.

He frowned and thumbed the screen awake.

The photo filled the display.

Him and Eben, side by side, laughing. Noel's head tipped just enough toward Eben that it looked intimate. Eben's hand rested at the small of Noel's back, casual, proprietary, like it had always belonged there.

The caption read:

**Tinsel Town knows a power couple when it sees one.**

The comments were already pouring in.

*Finally!*
*Called it from Day One.*
*They look real.*
*Look at the way he's touching him.*

Noel swallowed.

He looked up instinctively.

Eben was twenty feet away, crouched near the trailer, coaxing a stubborn generator back to life. He hadn't seen the post yet. He was focused, jaw tight, hands steady. The version of Eben who fixed things. The version who didn't look at Noel like that photo suggested.

Noel hesitated.

Then Eben's phone buzzed.

He watched the moment land.

Eben stilled. Just for a beat. Long enough that Noel knew he'd seen it.

Eben didn't look at him.

He stood, brushed dirt from his gloves, and turned back to the generator like nothing had happened.

The air shifted.

When Eben finally spoke, his voice was clipped, professional.

"We'll need to reroute the sound for the hayride."

Noel nodded. "Yeah. Sure."

Eben didn't meet his eyes.

Noel stared down at the phone again.

*They look real.*

The town thought it was settled.

Apparently, Eben did not.
