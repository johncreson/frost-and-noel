## Chapter 07: Hook Ending

Noel fell asleep that night with Eben's scarf still around his neck.

It was becoming a habit. A comfort. A reminder that this was real.

Eben had stayed for dinner. They'd worked on festival logistics. Argued about spreadsheet organization. Kissed on Noel's couch like teenagers.

It was perfect.

It was also temporary. Five days left.

Noel tried not to think about it.

His phone buzzed. Eben. *Thank you for tonight.*

Noel smiled. *Thank you for staying.*

*Always.*

That word. It shouldn't have meant as much as it did.

But it meant everything.

Noel set his phone down. Pulled the scarf tighter.

Tomorrow was the ice rink event. More festival chaos. More time together.

Five days.

They had five days to figure out if this could be more than temporary.

Noel was going to make every single one of them count.

He closed his eyes and thought: *It's real. He said it's real.*

And for the first time in years, Noel Merrick fell asleep without worrying about tomorrow.

Because tomorrow, Eben would be there.

And that was enough.
