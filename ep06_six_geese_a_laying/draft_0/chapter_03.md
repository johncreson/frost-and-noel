## Chapter 03: Evening Walk

The event was winding down.

Sunset painted the farm in gold and amber, the kind of light that made everything look softer. Families were packing up. Volunteers were breaking down tables. The goats, mercifully, were contained.

Noel stood by the fence, watching the sun sink toward the horizon, and felt—

Content. That was the word. Content.

"Hey."

He turned. Eben was there, hands in pockets, looking almost relaxed.

"Hey yourself."

"Good event."

"Only four goat escapes. We should get a trophy."

Eben smiled. Actually smiled. "You did well."

"We did well," Noel corrected.

"I mostly just chased livestock."

"You helped a scared kid pet a lamb. You wrapped me in a scarf. You kept me from freezing to death." Noel's voice went soft. "You did more than chase livestock."

Eben looked at him. The golden light caught his face, made his expression almost vulnerable.

"Walk with me?" Eben asked.

"Yeah. Okay."

They walked along the fence line, side by side, shoulders brushing with every few steps.

Neither suggested they stop.

The farm was quiet now. Just the sound of their footsteps and the distant murmur of volunteers cleaning up.

"You're good at this," Eben said finally.

"Chasing goats?"

"Being kind. When you think no one's watching."

Noel's breath caught. Those were his words. From earlier. Eben was giving them back.

"I'm always watching," Noel said quietly.

"I know."

Eben's hand found his.

They kept walking.

"One week," Noel said.

"One week," Eben agreed.

"What happens after?"

"I don't know."

"Do you want to know?"

Eben stopped walking. Turned to face him. "Yes."

Noel's heart was pounding. "Yeah?"

"I don't know how to make it work. I don't know if I can stay. But I—" Eben's jaw tightened. "I want to try."

"Okay."

"Okay?"

"Yeah." Noel stepped closer. "We'll figure it out."

"You keep saying that."

"Because I believe it."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. "How?"

"How what?"

"How do you keep believing? Even when it's complicated?"

Noel thought about it. "Because the alternative is giving up before we even try. And I don't want to do that."

"Even if it doesn't work?"

"Even then. At least we'll know we tried."

Eben's hand tightened on his. "I don't deserve you."

"That's not how this works."

"How does it work?"

"We both just—show up. And try. And hope it's enough."

Eben pulled him closer. Kissed him.

It was soft. Gentle. The kind of kiss that said *I'm here* instead of *this is temporary.*

When they pulled apart, the sun had set, and the farm was bathed in twilight.

"Come on," Eben said quietly. "There's a barn over there."

"Very romantic."

"It has hay bales and fairy lights. I checked."

Noel laughed. "You checked?"

"I'm a logistics professional. I plan ahead."

"For barn make-outs?"

"For privacy."

Noel's breath caught. "Oh."

"Only if you want—"

"Yes," Noel said immediately. "Yes. Absolutely yes."

Eben smiled. Took his hand.

They walked to the barn together.

And Noel thought: *This is it. This is the moment.*

He was ready.
