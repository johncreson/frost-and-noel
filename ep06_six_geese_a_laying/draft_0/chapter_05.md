## Chapter 05: The Morning After (Again, Again)

Noel woke up in his own bed, which was becoming a pattern.

He also woke up to sunlight streaming through his window and the smell of coffee, which was new.

He sat up.

Eben was in his kitchen, making coffee like he belonged there.

Noel's heart did something complicated in his chest.

"Morning," Eben said, not looking up.

"Morning." Noel's voice was rough with sleep. "You stayed."

"I stayed."

"You made coffee."

"I did."

"In my kitchen."

"That's generally where coffee is made, yes."

Noel laughed. Got out of bed. Crossed to the kitchen.

Eben handed him a mug.

"Thank you," Noel said softly.

"You're welcome."

They stood there, drinking coffee, not talking.

It felt—domestic. Normal. Like they'd been doing this for years instead of days.

"Last night—" Noel started.

"Was real," Eben finished. "I meant what I said."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

Noel set his coffee down. Stepped closer. "So what now?"

"Now we have five days left."

"Five days."

"And then—"

"We figure it out," Noel said firmly. "Together."

Eben looked at him. "You're very optimistic."

"Someone has to be."

"What if it doesn't work?"

"What if it does?"

Eben smiled. Actually smiled. "Fair point."

Noel kissed him. Soft. Sweet. The kind of kiss that said *good morning* instead of *goodbye.*

When they pulled apart, Eben was smiling.

"What?" Noel asked.

"Nothing. You're just—" Eben paused. "You make it easy. To hope."

Noel's chest felt tight. "Good."

"Good," Eben echoed.

They finished their coffee. Got ready for the day. Moved around each other in Noel's small apartment like they'd choreographed it.

It felt right.

It felt real.

And for the first time, Noel let himself believe it could last.
