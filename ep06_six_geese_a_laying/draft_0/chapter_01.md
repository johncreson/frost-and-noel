## Chapter 01: Farm Arrival

The goats escaped four times. This was considered a moderate success for a farm charity event.

Noel stood in the middle of Patterson Farm, clipboard in hand, watching chaos unfold with the kind of resigned acceptance that came from years of event management.

Kids everywhere. Animals everywhere. Volunteers trying to corral both with varying degrees of success.

It was beautiful, actually. The farm had been decorated for Christmas—garland on the fence posts, lights strung through the barn, a massive wreath on the main gate. The air smelled like hay and pine and hot cider from the donation table.

It was also complete pandemonium.

"How many times have the goats escaped?" Eben appeared at his elbow, looking vaguely alarmed.

"Four."

"That seems like a lot."

"The average is six. We're doing great."

Eben stared at him. "That's your metric for success?"

"Welcome to farm events." Noel checked his clipboard. "Petting zoo is operational. Donation table is set up. Cider station is—" He looked across the field. "On fire."

"What?"

"Kidding. It's fine. Probably."

Eben made a sound that might have been a laugh or might have been internal screaming.

They'd been like this all morning. Easy. Comfortable. The distance from Episode 4 was gone. The fake dating from Episode 5 had shifted into something real, and neither of them was pretending otherwise anymore.

One week. They had one week.

Noel was going to make it count.

"Noel!" A volunteer waved him over. "We need help with the lamb!"

"On it!" Noel turned to Eben. "You good here?"

"Define 'good.'"

"Not actively panicking?"

"Then yes. Barely."

Noel grinned and jogged off.

Behind him, Eben watched him go with an expression that the entire town could read except, apparently, Noel.

---

An hour later, the event was in full swing.

Families everywhere. Kids petting animals with varying degrees of gentleness. Volunteers managing the chaos with practiced efficiency.

Noel was in his element. Charming donors. Organizing volunteers. Solving problems before they became disasters.

Eben was... adapting.

"You're doing great," Noel said, passing him with an armful of donation forms.

"I'm standing still and trying not to get trampled."

"Exactly. Great work."

Eben caught his hand as he passed. Just for a second. A brief touch.

Noel's breath caught.

Then Eben let go, and Noel kept moving, and neither of them acknowledged what had just happened.

But the town noticed.

Mayor Kringle, manning the cider station, smiled.

Hugh, somehow covered in hay despite being nowhere near the animals, grinned.

Sam Rook, the local mechanic who'd shown up to help with setup, gave a quiet nod of approval.

Whatever Noel and Eben were, it was obvious to everyone.

Except, apparently, them.

"Noel!" A kid's voice, panicked. "The goat!"

Noel looked up.

A goat—Daisy, if he remembered correctly—was making a break for it across the field.

"Not again," Noel muttered.

He started running.

So did Eben.

They moved in sync, coordinating without speaking. Eben went left. Noel went right. The goat, realizing it was cornered, tried to bolt through the middle.

Eben cut it off.

Noel grabbed it.

They both ended up on the ground, out of breath, holding a very indignant goat between them.

Their eyes met.

Noel started laughing.

It was real laughter. Uncontrolled. The kind that came from pure joy instead of performance.

Eben was staring at him like he'd never seen him before.

"What?" Noel managed, still laughing.

"Nothing," Eben said quietly. "You're just—"

"Covered in dirt?"

"Happy."

Noel's laughter faded. "Yeah. I am."

They stayed there for a moment, on the ground, holding a goat, looking at each other.

Then the goat bleated indignantly, and the moment broke.

"We should get her back," Noel said.

"Probably."

Neither of them moved.

Then Eben stood, offered his hand, and pulled Noel to his feet.

They walked back to the petting zoo together, goat in tow, and Noel thought: *This is real. This is finally real.*

And for the first time in a long time, he believed it.
