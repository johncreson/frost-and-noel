## Chapter 04: The Ask

The barn smelled like hay and romantic clichés.

Noel was aware of this. Eben was probably aware of this. Neither of them mentioned it.

The space was quiet. Private. Fairy lights strung along the rafters cast everything in soft gold. Hay bales stacked against the walls. It was absurdly perfect.

"This is—" Noel started.

"I know," Eben said.

"Very—"

"I know."

They stood there, facing each other, and Noel felt his heart pounding so hard he was sure Eben could hear it.

"What do you want?" Eben asked quietly.

Noel hesitated.

"I'm not going to guess, Noel." Eben's voice was firm but gentle. "Tell me what you want."

Noel took a breath. This was it. The moment. He could say something safe. Something temporary. Something that wouldn't risk everything.

Or he could be brave.

"I want this to be real," Noel said. "Not the fake dating. Not the performance. *This.* Us. Whatever we are. I want it to be real."

The silence stretched.

Eben was looking at him with an expression Noel couldn't read.

Noel's chest started to ache. "If you don't—if that's not what you want, I understand. We can keep it temporary. We can—"

"It's real," Eben said.

Noel's breath caught. "What?"

"It's real." Eben stepped closer. "It's been real. I've been pretending it wasn't, but it is. It's real."

"Eben—"

"I don't know how to make this work. I don't know if I can stay. But I know that this—" He gestured between them. "This is real. You're real. And I'm tired of pretending otherwise."

Noel's eyes were burning. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

"Okay."

"Okay?"

"Yeah." Noel laughed. It sounded wet. "Okay. Good. That's—that's good."

Eben pulled him close. Kissed him.

It was different this time. Not desperate. Not uncertain. This was—certain. Real.

Noel kissed him back, hands finding purchase in Eben's shirt, pulling him closer.

"Tell me if—" Eben started.

"Yes," Noel said.

"I didn't finish."

"I don't care. Yes."

Eben laughed against his mouth. "Noel."

"What?"

"I need you to use words."

"I am using words. Yes is a word."

"Specific words."

Noel pulled back slightly. Looked at him. "I want you. I want this. I want—" He stopped. Took a breath. "I want you to touch me. I want to touch you. I want—everything. Is that specific enough?"

Eben's expression went dark in a way that made Noel's knees weak. "Yes."

"Good."

"Good," Eben echoed.

They kissed again. Deeper this time. Hands finding skin. Breath coming faster.

"Here?" Noel managed.

"If you want."

"I want."

"Good."

That word. It shouldn't have undone him. But the way Eben said it—low, approving, like Noel had done something right just by wanting—something in Noel's chest unlocked.

They didn't go all the way. Not tonight. But they crossed lines. Established trust. Learned each other in ways that felt intimate and real and absolutely devastating.

When they finally pulled apart, both breathing hard, Noel felt—

Changed. That was the word. Changed.

"Okay?" Eben asked softly.

"Yeah." Noel's voice was rough. "More than okay."

"Good."

Noel laughed. "You keep saying that."

"Because it's true."

They sat there in the hay, wrapped around each other, and Noel thought: *This is real. This is finally, actually real.*

And for the first time in his life, he believed it completely.

---

They drove home in comfortable silence.

Eben's hand on the gearshift. Noel's hand on his.

Neither spoke. They didn't need to.

*It's real.*

Those two words had changed everything.

Noel watched the road slide past and felt something settle in his chest. Not certainty—it was too early for that. But hope. Real hope.

Eben Frost had said "it's real." He'd meant it.

That was enough.

For now, that was everything.
