## Chapter 02: Caretaking

The afternoon was colder than Noel had anticipated.

He'd dressed for activity, not standing around, and now that the initial chaos had settled into a manageable hum, he was starting to feel it.

He wrapped his arms around himself and tried to look like he wasn't freezing.

"You're cold."

Noel jumped. Eben had appeared at his elbow with the stealth of a particularly judgmental cat.

"I'm fine."

"Your lips are blue."

"That's normal."

"It's absolutely not normal." Eben was already unwrapping his scarf. "Get over here."

"That's not—"

"Now."

Noel's brain short-circuited at the command in Eben's voice.

He stepped closer.

Eben wrapped the scarf around Noel's neck carefully, like it was a precision operation. Like it mattered.

Because it did matter. Everything about Noel Merrick mattered, and Eben had stopped pretending otherwise approximately three goat chases ago.

The scarf was warm. It smelled like Eben's cologne—clean, understated, devastatingly familiar.

Noel went very still.

"Better?" Eben asked quietly.

"You didn't have to—"

"You're cold."

"That's not—"

"You're welcome."

Noel didn't argue. Just pulled the scarf tighter and tried not to think about how this was the second time Eben had given him a scarf, and how he still had the first one at home, and how he was absolutely never giving either of them back.

"Thank you," Noel said softly.

Eben's expression shifted. Softened. "You're welcome."

They stood there for a moment, too close, surrounded by the noise of the farm event but somehow existing in their own quiet bubble.

"You're good at this," Noel said.

"Wrapping scarves?"

"Taking care of people."

Eben's jaw tightened. "I'm not—"

"You are." Noel reached up, adjusted the scarf. His fingers brushed Eben's hand. "You're better at it than you think."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him.

"Noel—"

"Help!" A small voice, panicked.

They both turned.

A little kid—maybe five or six—was standing near the lamb pen, crying.

Eben moved immediately.

Noel watched him cross the field, crouch down to the kid's level, voice going gentle in a way that made Noel's chest ache.

This was becoming a pattern. Every time Noel thought he understood Eben, the man revealed another layer of decency.

It was exhausting.

It was also the most attractive thing Noel had ever seen.

---

The kid's name was Emma, and she was terrified of the lamb.

"It's okay," Eben said quietly. "You don't have to pet it if you don't want to."

"But everyone else is," Emma sniffled.

"That doesn't mean you have to."

"I want to. I'm just scared."

Eben nodded. "That's okay. Being scared is normal."

"You're not scared."

"I'm scared of lots of things."

Emma looked skeptical. "Like what?"

Eben paused. "Goats, apparently. They're very fast."

Emma giggled.

"Here," Eben said. "How about this. I'll pet the lamb first. You watch. Then, if you want, you can try. But only if you want."

Emma nodded.

Eben reached out slowly, let the lamb sniff his hand, then gently stroked its wool.

"See? It's soft. And it's not scary. It's just a baby."

Emma watched. Then, very slowly, she reached out her hand.

Eben guided her, patient and careful.

Emma's fingers touched the lamb's wool.

Her face lit up. "It's so soft!"

"It is," Eben agreed.

Emma petted the lamb for a solid minute, beaming the entire time.

Then she ran off to tell her parents, leaving Eben alone by the pen.

He stood. Turned.

Caught Noel watching.

A beat. Something passed between them.

Noel trusted him. That was the moment he knew: he trusted Eben Frost.

Not just with logistics. Not just with the festival.

With everything.

Eben crossed the field to him.

"You're staring," Eben said quietly.

"You're good with kids."

"I'm adequate with kids."

"You're good with people. When you think no one's watching."

Eben's expression shifted. "You're always watching."

"Yeah," Noel said softly. "I am."

They stood there, the noise of the farm event swirling around them, and Noel thought: *I'm in so much trouble.*

The good kind of trouble.

The kind that felt like coming home.
