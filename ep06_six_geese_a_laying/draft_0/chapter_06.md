## Chapter 06: Town Knows

The town knew.

Noel realized this approximately three minutes into his morning walk to Merryweather Hall.

Mrs. Patterson from the farm waved at him with a knowing smile.

Wes from the bakery gave him a thumbs up through the window.

Mayor Kringle actually winked.

"Oh god," Noel muttered.

Eben, walking beside him, looked amused. "What?"

"The town knows."

"Knows what?"

"About us."

"We've been fake dating for days. Of course they know."

"No, I mean—they know it's not fake anymore."

Eben paused. "How do you know?"

"Mrs. Patterson just gave me the most knowing smile I've ever seen. Wes gave me a thumbs up. The Mayor *winked.*"

"The Mayor winks at everyone."

"Not like that."

Eben looked around. Several people were, in fact, watching them with expressions that ranged from delighted to smug.

"Huh," Eben said.

"Huh?"

"They're not subtle."

"No one in this town is subtle."

"Fair point."

They kept walking.

Hugh appeared from nowhere, covered in what looked like tinsel.

"So," Hugh said, grinning. "You two finally figured it out."

"Figured what out?" Noel asked innocently.

"That you're disgustingly in love and everyone could see it except you."

Noel choked. "We're not—"

"You are," Hugh said cheerfully. "It's very obvious. Also very cute. I'm happy for you."

He walked away before Noel could respond.

Noel looked at Eben. "Did he just—"

"Say we're in love? Yes."

"And you're not—"

"Panicking? No." Eben took his hand. Right there. In the middle of Main Street. Where everyone could see. "Are you?"

Noel looked at their joined hands. At Eben's face. At the town watching them with varying degrees of delight.

"No," he said softly. "I'm not panicking."

"Good."

They walked to Merryweather Hall hand in hand, and Noel thought: *The town knows. And I don't care.*

That felt like progress.
