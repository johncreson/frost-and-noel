## Chapter 6: The Ask

The barn smelled like hay and romantic clichés. Someone should probably address that.

Noel was acutely aware that he was standing in a barn with Eben Frost, golden hour light streaming through the weathered boards, dust motes floating in the air like someone had hired a cinematographer for maximum emotional impact.

They'd wandered away from the main event, ostensibly to check on the equipment storage. In reality, Noel suspected they'd both just needed a minute away from the crowd.

"Today was good," Eben said.

"Yeah." Noel leaned against a hay bale. "Chaotic, but good."

"You're good at this."

"So you keep saying."

"I mean it."

They looked at each other. The light was doing something impossible to Eben's face, softening the sharp edges, making him look almost approachable.

Noel's heart was pounding.

"Eben—"

"Noel—"

They both stopped. Laughed nervously.

"You first," Eben said.

Noel took a breath. "I want to ask you something."

"Okay."

"And I need you to actually answer. Not deflect. Not set a boundary. Just—tell me what you think."

Eben's expression was careful. "I'm listening."

"What are we doing?"

The question hung in the air between them. Simple. Direct. Terrifying.

"What do you mean?" Eben asked quietly.

"I mean—" Noel pushed off the hay bale, stepped closer. "One week. That's what we said. But I keep waiting for you to tell me this isn't real. That it's temporary. That it doesn't mean anything."

"You know it means something."

"I know you *feel* something. That's not the same as knowing what this is."

Eben was silent for a long moment.

"I don't have answers," he said finally. "I don't know what happens after the festival. I don't know how to make this work. I don't know—"

"I'm not asking for a plan." Noel stepped closer still. They were almost touching now. "I'm asking you one thing."

"What?"

"I want this to be real." Noel's voice was steady, despite the fact that his hands were shaking. "Not the fake dating. Not the performance. *This.* You and me. I want it to be real."

Eben looked at him. Really looked at him. The mask had dropped completely—no professionalism, no distance, just raw, unguarded want mixed with fear.

"Noel—"

"Tell me," Noel said. "Tell me if it's real or if I'm imagining this."

The silence stretched. Noel could hear his own heartbeat.

Then Eben's hand came up, cupped his face, and Eben said:

"It's real."

Two words. Simple. Direct.

Everything.

"It's real," Eben repeated. "You're not imagining it. I'm not running. I don't have answers about the future, but I can tell you that this—" His thumb brushed Noel's cheek. "This is real."

Noel couldn't breathe.

"Okay," he managed.

"Okay?"

"Yeah." Noel laughed, a little broken, a lot relieved. "Okay. I can work with that."

Eben kissed him.

It wasn't soft. It wasn't gentle. It was claiming—a statement, a confirmation, every word Eben couldn't say poured into the press of lips and the grip of his hand on Noel's hip.

When they pulled apart, they were both breathing hard.

"We should go," Eben said, but he didn't move.

"Yeah," Noel agreed, but he didn't move either.

They stood there in the golden light, hay dust swirling around them, and Noel thought: *This is real.*

Finally. Finally, it was real.
