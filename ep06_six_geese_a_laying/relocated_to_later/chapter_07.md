## Chapter 7: Hook Ending

The drive back to town was quiet.

Not uncomfortable quiet. The good kind—the kind that meant neither of them felt the need to fill the silence with performance.

Noel watched the fields blur past the window, Eben's scarf still wrapped around his neck, his hand resting on the center console. Eben's hand found his somewhere around the halfway point and stayed there.

"Today was a lot," Eben said.

"Yeah."

"Good, though."

"Yeah." Noel smiled. "Good, though."

They drove for another few minutes in comfortable silence. The sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink.

"I'm not good at this," Eben said finally.

Noel looked at him. "At what?"

"Relationships. Feelings. The whole—" He gestured vaguely with his free hand. "Thing."

"I noticed."

"It's not something I've practiced."

"I hadn't picked up on that."

Eben shot him a look. "You're mocking me."

"Lovingly."

The word hung in the air. Noel hadn't meant to say it. Eben's hand tightened on his.

"I'm trying," Eben said quietly. "I don't know if I'm any good at it. But I'm trying."

"That's all I'm asking."

"Are you sure? Because it seems like you're asking for someone who has their life together, and I'm—" He stopped. "I'm a disaster wearing a professional mask."

Noel laughed. "Welcome to the club. I've been a disaster wearing a competent smile for years."

"You're not a disaster."

"I make chaos look organized. That's literally my job description."

Eben's mouth twitched. Almost a smile. "We're both disasters."

"Probably."

"This is probably a terrible idea."

"Almost certainly."

"I'm doing it anyway."

Noel's chest ached—the good kind of ache. The kind that meant something important. "Yeah. Me too."

They pulled into town as the streetlights were coming on. Tinsel Town looked like a postcard, all fairy lights and festive storefronts and the faint smell of cinnamon from the bakery.

Eben parked in front of Noel's building. Neither of them moved to get out.

"I should go," Eben said.

"Yeah."

"Early morning tomorrow."

"Same."

Still neither of them moved.

"Dinner tomorrow?" Eben asked. "After the festival stuff?"

Noel smiled. "Like a date?"

"Like a date."

"I can do that."

Eben leaned over and kissed him—brief, sweet, a promise—and then pulled back.

"Goodnight, Noel."

"Goodnight, Eben."

Noel got out of the car. Walked to his building. Turned back at the door.

Eben was still there, watching, making sure he got inside safe.

Noel waved. Eben waved back.

Something had shifted. Something real.

Noel went inside, still wearing Eben's scarf, and thought: *We're terrible at this. But we're doing it anyway.*

He was smiling so hard his face hurt.
