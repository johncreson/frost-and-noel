## Chapter 5: Reliable Truth

There's something about watching a man gently help a terrified child approach a lamb that rearranges your entire understanding of him.

Noel was having that experience now. And deeply resenting it.

Eben was kneeling in the hay, speaking softly to a little girl who couldn't have been more than five. She was clutching her mom's hand, eyes wide, clearly desperate to pet the lamb but too scared to move closer.

"She won't hurt you," Eben said. His voice was low. Patient. A tone Noel had never heard from him before. "See? She's just curious."

"What if she bites?" the girl asked.

"Lambs don't have top front teeth. She couldn't bite you even if she wanted to."

"Really?"

"Really. Do you want to try?"

The girl looked at the lamb. At Eben. At her mom.

Then she reached out. Her small hand touched the lamb's wool.

"It's soft," she whispered.

"Very soft," Eben agreed.

The girl smiled—huge and delighted—and Eben smiled back, and Noel had to look away before he did something embarrassing like cry in front of farm animals.

Great. Perfect. Emotionally unavailable glacier man was also good with children and animals. Noel's type, apparently, was *everything he thought he didn't want.*

He busied himself with the donation station, organizing clipboards he'd already organized, trying not to stare.

"You're staring," Hugh said, appearing out of nowhere.

"I'm not staring."

"You're absolutely staring. It's adorable and pathetic."

"Thank you for that assessment."

"He's good with kids," Hugh observed, nodding toward Eben. "Didn't expect that."

"Neither did I."

"You look like someone hit you in the chest with a board."

Noel finally looked away from where Eben was now helping another child meet the lamb. "I'm fine."

"Sure. The 'fine' that means 'I'm having feelings and it's inconvenient.'"

Noel didn't answer. He didn't have to.

An hour later, the afternoon was winding down. Families were leaving with donation receipts and happy kids. The animals were settled. The chaos had resolved into something that felt almost peaceful.

Noel was standing by the fence when Eben walked over, unwinding the scarf from his own neck.

"You're cold," Eben said.

"I'm fine."

"Your lips are blue."

"That's normal."

"Get over here."

"That's not—"

"Now."

Noel opened his mouth to argue. Closed it. Walked over.

Eben wrapped the scarf around Noel's neck. Carefully. Deliberately. The same way he'd done back at the festival, except this time it felt different. More intentional. More like claiming something.

The scarf was warm from Eben's body heat. Smelled like his cologne.

"Better," Eben said.

Noel's throat was tight. "You didn't have to—"

"I wanted to."

Simple. Direct. No qualifications.

Noel looked at him. At this man who organized goat rescues and helped scared kids and wrapped his scarf around Noel like it was the most natural thing in the world.

"You're reliable," Noel said quietly.

Eben blinked. "What?"

"You. You're reliable. I didn't expect that."

"Is that—" Eben's jaw tightened. "Is that a bad thing?"

"No." Noel's voice was soft. "It's just. I'm not used to it."

Something shifted in Eben's expression. Understanding. Recognition.

"I'm not going anywhere," Eben said. "Not yet."

*Not yet.*

The words should have hurt. They should have reminded Noel of the deadline, the unavoidable end point.

Instead, they felt like a promise.

*I'm not going anywhere. Not yet.*

It wasn't forever. But it was enough for now.
